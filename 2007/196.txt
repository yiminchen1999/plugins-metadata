         Abstract. In this study our goal is to conduct a "connective ethnography" that focuses on how
         gaming  expertise  spreads  across a network   of youth  at an  after-school  club that simultaneously
         participates in a  multi-player virtual  environment    (MUVE).    We    draw  on  multiple  sources  of
         information:  observations,   interviews,  video  recordings,   online tracking    and  chat data,   and
         hundreds of hours of play in the virtual environment of Whyville ourselves.        By focusing on one
         particular type of insider knowledge, called teleporting, we traced youth learning in a variety of
         online and offline social contexts, both from friends in the club and outside members of Whyville.
         We  elaborate   on  the  unplanned  social events  that  served as  instigators for  peaks   in learning
         activity and the methodological challenges underlying the synthesis of diverse types of data that
         allowed us to follow youth across multiple spaces and times.

         With the growing popularity of online games, discussions about their educational value have been initiated
among   researchers,  practitioners, and policy  makers   (Glazer, 2006).   There  is an  increased   need  to more   fully
understand these complex communities as promising models for learning and literacy (Gee, 2003). Though learning
to participate in any of these multiplayer game communities can be quite overwhelming and confusing, there are
only few first person accounts of how newcomers get access to insider knowledge (Steinkuehler, 2006).            When we
started studying an   after-school club  where  twenty-one   9-12  year-olds  came  regularly   to play  in a multi-player
online game community called Whyville, we were intrigued with the ways that they helped each other to navigate
the geographical intricacies of the site and how the participants subsequently appeared to become peer teachers in
their own right (Ching & Kafai, in press).    In addition, it became clear that learning took place in both online and
offline locations as well as between club members and within the larger world of Whyville.          Our questions for this
study became: How did club members learn insider knowledge important to socializing on Whyville and how did
this spread throughout the club?     Secondarily, how could we trace this learning across both virtual and physical
spaces, and between the club community and the larger Whyville community?          Finally, what can we learn from the
informal teaching and    learning practices among   peers  that  could positively impact  the design  of   technology  that
blurred the boundaries between virtual and physical spaces?       In order to answer our questions, we had to draw on
new methodologies that studied both online and offline activity, inside and outside of club time.

Research Background
         Our research draws on two existing but distinct bodies of research about multi-player online communities.
The more prominent and larger body has focused on online gaming contexts, conducting ethnographies of gaming
communities (Steinkuehler, 2004; Taylor, 2006; Turkle, 1995; Yee, forthcoming). In these studies, researchers used
ethnographic and interview methods to document and analyze players' interactions, preferences, and reflections as
they relate to their online game play. The second smaller body has examined the offline gaming contexts in places
such as  after-school clubs, individuals  playing   at home, and   especially cybercafés   (Lin, forthcoming;    Swalwell,
2003). While cybercafés (or LAN cafés) initially provided places for players to link computers physically in order to
play multiplayer games   with speedier   internet access,  their popularity has   not decreased  with the   onset of cable
modems in many homes (Swalwell, 2003).          Ethnographic    studies in Australia, Asia,  and   Europe   have identified
reasons for this continued frequenting of cybercafés, namely the informal learning and dynamic social interactions
present in such  spaces  (Beavis,    Nixon, &  Atkinson,   2005;  Jansz  &  Martens,   2005;  Lægran     &  Stewart, 2003;
Swalwell, 2003).  Most if not all of the informal learning cited by cybercafé players is directly related to the physical
presence of other players in the same space and includes walking around and watching other people play, checking
out the patches and new computer code others have downloaded for a game, asking about adjustments to computers,

                                                            196                                                  CSCL 2007
and watching their strategies in various games (Beavis, Nixon, & Atkinson, 2005).

         More recently, researchers have argued that the boundaries between play in the virtual and the real are not
as distinct as some have made them out to be, and both need to be considered as integrated aspects of play in virtual
communities    (Castronova,     2005;  Jenkins,  2006;   Kafai,  in press;  Leander    & McKim,     2003).      As   Leander  and
McKim (2003) point out, experiences in cyberspace have become a part of the everyday activities and meaning-
making of many adolescents and in fact often "extend rather than replace offline relationships" (p. 219).                  Indeed,
thinking of either physical/offline/real or digital/online/virtual as self-contained denies their flexibility and the ways
that people    negotiate performance,     meaning,   and embodiment     within  them:   "Only   when   we    really acknowledge
these spaces as legitimate and powerful sites of production, and acknowledge the diverse agents involved in their
creation, can we begin to address the challenges facing them progressively" (Taylor, 2006).

         Connective      ethnography     (Hine,  2000;  Leander    & McKim,     2003)    is one  methodology      that   has  been
proposed    to address   this issue of   integrating research  across  online and  offline   spaces  by   "tracing   the flows of
objects, texts, and bodies" and analyzing the construction of boundaries within and between virtual and physical
spaces  (Leander   &   McKim,     2003,  p.  211).    Still in its  nascent development     it seeks   to interrupt  the artificial
boundaries between online and offline spaces and understand "the processes by which social spaces are held apart
and blended, and how boundaries and blends are recognized in everyday practice" (p. 229).

         One of the reasons researchers have been so interested in studying gaming communities is because of the
intricacies of  game play.    As  Steinkuehler   argues,  participating in  such  communities    is  "cognitively   complex   and
consequential" (2006, p. 50).       In   addition, many   of   them sponsor   the development     of distributed    expertise and
leaders who act as resources across the communities (Gee, 2004).           This type of peer mentorship and development of
expertise has been documented amongst children learning in online programming environments (Bruckman, 2000)
and learning by design (Ching & Kafai, in press).        Other researchers have noted the way that knowledge can spread
(Roth, 1996) and even "snowball" (Anderson et al., 2001) amongst children sharing the same physical space in a
classroom.   What happens when children share not only a physical space but also participate in a dramatically larger
virtual community?

         In this study our goal is to conduct a connective ethnography that focuses on how gaming expertise spreads
across a network of youth at an after-school club that simultaneously participates in a multi-player virtual world.
We   draw   on  multiple  sources    of  information:   observations   (field notes),   interviews,  video     recordings, online
tracking and chat data, and hundreds of hours of play on Whyville ourselves.             These different, complementary data
sources embody the multi-modal aspects of connective ethnography, and allow us to trace players' activities and
learning across physical and virtual spaces.         Since this type of methodology is relatively new, we hope that this
study will inform future efforts at researching and analyzing play and learning across blurred virtual and physical
spaces.

         While there are many different types of insider expertise that developed and became distributed amongst
the youth of the club, in this first study we focus on one particular type of knowledge called teleporting and how it
spread among club members.          Teleporting    consists of a simple two-word    command      typed    in a player's  chat that
automatically transports players to social places unlisted in the destination menu on Whyville (e.g. "teleport moon"
takes a player to a space in Whyville called the Moon not accessible in any other manner).             The reason for focusing
on this knowledge (teleporting) is threefold.        First, it is a type of insider knowledge and a archetype of many facets
of gaming   capital  (Consalvo,     in   press) discovered   through  personal   trial and  error   or interaction   with  others.
Second, it is a very traceable type of knowledge, easily identified in chat lines (though not visible to other players),
and  a common    practice   at  the club  that  could not   be learned outside of  Whyville.     Further, teleporting involves
crossing different  boundaries      that are important   to  connective ethnography;     not   only  does    teleporting facilitate
crossing between virtual spaces on Whyville, it represents passing between outsider and insider status in both the
physically and virtually located communities of our study.

Research Setting and Approach
         Whyville.net    is   a multi-user   virtual environment    (MUVE)    with over   1.5  million    registered players  that
encourages youth ages 8-16 to play casual science games in order to earn a virtual salary (in `clams'), which youth
can then spend on buying and designing parts for their avatars (virtual characters), projectiles to throw at other users,
and other goods. The general consensus among Whyvillians (the citizens of the virtual community of Whyville) is

                                                                197                                                      CSCL 2007
that  earning  a  good salary and thus  procuring a  large   number  of clams to  spend  on face parts  or other goods is
essential for fully participating in the Whyville community (Kafai & Giang, in press). Social interactions with others
are   the highlight for most  Whyvillians   and consist primarily    of  ymailing  (the Whyville  version  of email)  and
chatting on the site where users are visible to each other on the screen (see the picture of the Beach in Figure 1). A
pull down menu offers a listing of over 30 different places to visit and hang out together on Whyville

             Some of the more popular places in which to socialize are not visible to users in the menus available on the
site: Earth,   Moon, Mars,  Jupiter, Saturn, and  the Newspaper.     These  sites can  only be reached  by  "teleporting,"
which     is done by typing   "teleport moon"   (or "teleport  [place]") in  the  chat  bubble above one's    head. Since
teleporting cannot be observed on Whyville (users are zapped to the new location before others have a chance to
read what they typed), the existence of these locations and the knowledge of how to get there can only be discovered
through   conversation  with  other  people or by   visiting one  of the few  cheat sites that has tips for Whyvillians.
Because of this, these select places come to represent insider status and many players prize them as social hang-outs
because they are not over-crowded or over-populated by newbies.

             In early 2005 we set up an after-school club where 20 youth in the 4th-6th grades came to play on Whyville
for an hour most days after school.     Most youth were new to Whyville, though one had played for the year before
the club started.   They distributed themselves among 10 computers, often sharing a computer or wandering around
the room talking to others. While the club began as a quiet place, it quickly became loud and lively as participants
learned the site and began to shout advice to each other, arrange parties on Whyville, chat, throw virtual projectiles
at one another, and critique each other's avatars (Kafai, in press). Often clusters of youth would form around one
computer when something interesting happened on Whyville (see Figure 2).

              Figure 2: Club Members Clustered around Computers, One Member Helping Another

             In order to study the children's activities in the "multiple, simultaneous space-time contexts" (Leander &
McKim, 2003) of the club and Whyville, we gathered and analyzed numerous types of qualitative data aimed to
track the youth in the club over multiple spaces (physically in the club as well as virtually over multiple spaces on
Whyville). Ethnographic field notes were recorded daily to capture the overall activity of the club while video tapes
focused on small groups of youth clustered at tables with 2-3 computers throughout the nine weeks the club took

                                                             198                                                 CSCL 2007
place in the winter of 2005. In addition, participants were interviewed individually at the end of the club and online
tracking data including location and chat in Whyville was collected.

           After an initial coding of the field notes and logging of the video data, we combed both types of data for
any mention of teleporting or the places to which one can teleport. Whenever teleporting was mentioned in either
source  it was  highlighted  and/or transcribed. Similarly, the  online tracking   data  was   searched  for the first time
children teleported, and the first time they teleported to Saturn, since that place was not commonly known early in
the club. This was done by selecting out club members' chat data from the larger database and searching for the
times they typed "teleport" in their chat. This data allowed us to identify the first time each participant teleported,
even if they were logged on to Whyville from home, and whether they sought any online help. After these incidents
of teleporting were identified from all of the data, we organized them into a timeline to coordinate when and how
children learned to teleport. We then further analyzed both the online tracking data and the video data to flesh out
the context(s) in which children discovered that teleporting existed and was an option for them. Through this process
we were able to compile a more complete picture of how and where youth learned to teleport than if we had not had
each type of data.

Findings
           There are many kinds of insider knowledge not obvious to newcomers in Whyville that were revealed in
our own play and learning on Whyville, as well as our observations of club members in field notes, video, and chat.
Among     these are   whispering, throwing  projectiles, designing   avatars, socializing,  earning   a  large salary,  and
teleporting. Almost all of these activities involve multiple types of logistical and cultural knowledge. Some of these
practices  can  be observed  and  copied: the  chat syntax  for throwing  projectiles  (done   by typing  "throw   mudball
[player's name]") is visible in other players' chat. Similarly, some flirting and befriending practices can be observed
in people's chat unless they are whispering (a private conversation between two individuals). Avatars' looks can be
copied, but it involves a very complex practice of earning clams (Whyville's currency), knowing where and how to
shop and trade for face parts, and assembling a "good look" that will make certain types of people want to talk to
you. Earning a salary is perhaps the most scaffolded of these practices on Whyville, since there are whole articles in
the local  newspaper   (Whyville  Times)  offering  suggestions. Still, playing    the salary-raising science  games    and
assembling face parts are not public on Whyville.       They are carried out in spaces on Whyville only visible to the
individual player.

           Teleporting may be the least obvious insider knowledge since one cannot observe it in others' chat (the
typed command "teleport moon" is not visible to others) unless people are publicly discussing a social gathering at
one of the teleport locations. The only exception to this can be found on select cheat sites where instructions on
teleporting are included on "tips" for newbies, or new players (Fields, 2007). Out of 39,673 lines of chat data from
club members, 2372 (5.98%) were instances when the word teleport was used. By searching through this online chat
data, we were able to determine when each club member first teleported (See Table 1). This formed the basis of
further investigations  into from   whom,   how,    and  where  participants  learned   to teleport.  The broad    trend of
teleporting  activity reported in Table 1  reveals  a few  interesting  things. For one,   the first six youth  to  teleport
(Kaitlyn to Aidan) were members of the two 6th grade classes where students were also starting to use Whyville and
had more opportunities to play during the daytime than other club members. It seems natural that these would be
among the first club members to learn to teleport.

           Second, two  weeks  in  particular, Jan. 24­30  and  Jan. 31­Feb.    6, stand   out as times  when   the largest
numbers of club members learned how to teleport. What happened during those weeks? The identities and social
affiliations of the club members give us some hints. The four boys who first teleported the week of Jan. 24 liked to
throw projectiles together with Gabe, Aidan, and Kyle, so it is not surprising that they would learn fairly soon after
their more advanced friends. The following week starting on Jan. 31 seems to be evidence of a snowball effect on
the club (Anderson et al., 2001), as more youth learned to teleport, including three more girls. There is evidence in
our field notes and video data that during the week of Jan. 31 teleporting and projectile throwing became a much
more public activity, with youth yelling across the room to each other to "meet me at the Moon!" This probably
allowed other youth to overhear their conversations. In addition, as more youth teleported, others could glance at
their computer screens while wandering the room and see places like the Moon.

         Upon a closer look, we found that club members learned to teleport in a variety of social contexts. Two
among the first youth to teleport found out on Whyville by asking questions online (e.g. whskr29 and bluwave).
This is perhaps          the easiest  learning method                   to identify since     it is       literally     spelled        out           in the      text       (see         Figure          3).
Consider bluwave below, who on January 13 sought advice on a lot of things, including whispering, making friends,
dancing, and teleporting:

We chose this example because it reveals how teleporting is one of a number of things new Whyvillians learn. In
addition, bluwave, like many of the club members, did not ask how to teleport but how to get to the moon. She tried
asking anonymous people several times before getting the answers she needed. Unfortunately, the online data do not
show us how bluwave first heard about the Moon. However, there are other cases where we have more information.

       Instead of learning solely on Whyville, some club members learned how to teleport solely in the club by
directly asking a club members. For instance, Gabe learned from Briana (whskr29, one of the earliest teleporters)
while they were working on separate computers side by side (see Figure 4).

                       VIDEO TRANSCRIPT                                             INTERPRETATION
       Briana:    Teleport to the moon!
       Gabe:      Okay, I don't know how to though.                       Briana tells Gabe to go to the Moon.
       Briana:    No no wait, hold on.
       Gabe:      You teleport me there, please.                          Gabe asks her to just type it in on his
       Briana:    Just write Hey Marv.                                    computer since he doesn't know how.
       Gabe:      Hi- how do you spell Marv. ((typing "Hi"))
       Briana:    M-a-r-v-, just write a he doesn't care.                 Instead of answering, Briana recognizes
                 ((Gabe types))                                           another school friend, and tells Gabe to
       Briana:    No you didn't do r.                                     say hi.
       Briana:    M-a-v enter
       Gabe:      Enter. ((laughs as he presses "Enter"))                 Gabe types a greeting to Marv.
       ...
       Gabe:      "Let's go to the moon." ((reading))                     Marv tells him to go to the Moon.
                 Okay.                                                    Gabe responds that he will.
                 ((Gabe types a response))
       Gabe:      Hey how do you teleport to the moon.                    Gabe realizes he doesn't know how to get
       Briana:    Write, write that. Teleport moon.                       there and asks for help.
       Gabe:      Okay.
       Gabe:      Tel-e-port ((typing as he talks))
       Briana:    Don't write "to" just write "teleport moon,"            Briana identifies an error in Gabe's
                  m-o-o-n ((spelling Moon))                               command and corrects it.
       Gabe:      Teleport moon. ((types))
                                                                          Gabe successfully goes to the Moon.
                    Figure 4: Video Transcript of January 7: Gabe Learns how to Teleport

It is interesting that Gabe learned to teleport in the context of a social need to meet his friend Marv, a classmate who
did not participate in the after-school club.    In addition, since he was sitting next to Briana, she was able to observe
him typing and corrected his initial mistake of typing "teleport to moon," a mistake that she made frequently when
she learned how to teleport on Whyvlle earlier that day.

       Yet while some youth were relatively easy to trace in terms of learning how to teleport, others were more
difficult to trace in that they appeared to learn in both the club and Whyville, and even in Whyville learned from
either or both club members and Whyvillians in general. For instance, on Jan. 31, the video data show that Blake
yelled across the room to Cole, telling him to meet him at the Moon. While it is apparent from the field notes that
Cole was in the room with Isabel and logged on to her computer not long after Blake's call, the online tracking data
show that Isabel (ivy06) teleported to the moon directly after Blake called to Cole, then gossiped to someone on
Whyville that Cole (leo95) was "hot." The table below is a shortened version of the event that shows what we were
able to glean about the incident from the three primary types of data (see Table 2).

he can use the computer                                                                                         Isabel logs off and Cole

          This incident explains Isabel's effort to learn how to teleport on the following day. It seems apparent that
Cole either gave her direct instructions or typed "teleport moon" on her computer while she was logged on because
the next day during club she tried to teleport but did it incorrectly a number of times and asked Whyvillians several
times how to get to the Moon (see Figure 5).

                        Figure 5: Online Transcript of February 1: Isabel Tries to Teleport

Isabel eventually learned how to teleport consistently to Mars and the Moon, because on the following dates her
tracking data show a typical club member pattern of teleporting from one location to the next in rapid succession
(teleport Mars,    teleport                Moon, teleport Earth) while   on Whyville.   Interestingly, while   Isabel saw     the Moon    and
chatted with someone there on Jan. 31, in her interview, she said that she learned how to teleport from people at
Whyville. Other members of the club received mixed instruction on teleporting from youth physically present in the
club and from club members virtually present on Whyville.

          The    difficulty               of tracing teleporting throughout    the club   is further complicated   by  participants   often
learning to teleport to one or two locations (generally the Moon and Mars) first and later adding to their knowledge
through the discovery of other locations, like Saturn. Often this was done by trial and error or by knowing other
planet names. For instance, on the same day that Cole first teleported, he also experimented with teleporting to a
number of locations in the solar system, some of which existed, and some of which did not. Through this process, he
discovered Saturn as yet another social location on Whyville (see Figure 6).

         Others discovered Saturn in an unusual club-wide social incident on February 16th.             On this day, Leslie,
who had learned about Saturn through experimentation (like Cole) a few days earlier, organized a get-together with
Marissa, Ulani, and Isabel on that planet, inviting them by ymail to meet her at Saturn.            This invitation seems to
have provided   the instigation    for Marissa  and  Ulani to teleport for  the first time, and  while  Isabel  knew  how  to
teleport to the Moon, Mars, and Earth, she had not been to Saturn before that day.        While at Saturn, a Whyvillian not
a part of the club insulted Ulani, who yelled out to the club that someone had insulted her on Saturn.          Immediately
several other club members teleported to Saturn, two for the first time (they had to ask how to spell it), and threw
projectiles at the offender.   By the end of the day, almost all of the club members had been to Saturn, doubling the
daily average of Saturn visits by club members, a trend that continued through the remainder of the week.

         Despite the many different ways that club members learned how to teleport, interviews revealed a decided
preference for learning from other friends in the room (whether physically or virtually).       Almost two-thirds (64%) of
the youth interviewed said that the best way to learn something on Whyville was by talking to someone in the same
room.  The remaining youth preferred to talk to someone on Whyville. Specifically regarding teleporting, all but
three of the youth interviewed reported learning from a friend in the club.

Discussion
         Our study focused on how teleporting, a type of gaming expertise, spread across a network of youth at an
after-school club that simultaneously participated in a multi-player virtual world.       From our data it is clear that this
particular type of  information    was  only known    to one  member   at  the beginning   of  the after-school club  and six
weeks later  it had spread   to all but  one of  its members.     The main    mechanism   we   observed was  a  type  of peer
pedagogy   (Ching   &   Kafai,  in press)  provided  online  and  offline.  By  peer   pedagogy    we mean  to  describe  the
informal strategies of teaching others employed by teens. In addition to the direct mentoring found by Ching and
Kafai (in press), overhearing others and wandering the room observing people's screens and activities planted seeds
of curiosity about teleporting that were followed up on later.      In a sense, it allowed for learning things that one did
not know enough to ask about.       Similarly, unplanned social activities served as instigators for learning; teleporting
served an innately social purpose by providing transportation to places for people to hang out, and in turn social
gatherings  were  big   motivators  for  people  to  learn how   to teleport. We  also   found  that these  opportunities for
learning about   insider knowledge      were present  online, perhaps   most   prominent   in  the anonymous    asking   often
documented in the tracking data.       It was a quick and easy way to get information from more than one person. It is
perhaps  this   feature  of  information   sharing   and   requesting which    makes    online  gaming  a   fruitful learning
environment as some researchers have argued (Gee, 2003). For those who want to learn, they develop strategies
online and offline to request and receive help from others.       For those who want to provide assistance, it is a good
way to showcase their understanding.       The motivations for such helping, ranging from altruistic to self serving are
not always clear and require further investigations.

         Studying   interactions   between   online  and offline  gaming   contexts   presents considerable methodological
challenges and requires new approaches as some researchers have argued (Hine, 2000; Leander & McKim, 2003),
particularly because of the dynamic nature of interactions across spaces. The after-school setting in our study added
another layer of complexity because movements, interactions and play among club members were not constrained in
a specific space or time.   Our observations indicate that the teens engaged in many of the interactions around gaming
observed in adult commercial cybercafés (e.g., Beavis, Nixon, & Atkinson, 2005).              In our analyses we found that
each data  source  on   its own presented    us with  an important   slice of  information  about  players' movements     and
purposes but no data source alone was complete.        While the tracking data provided us with an accurate account of

                                                              203                                                    CSCL 2007
where players were going and what they were chatting about, it was often hard to discern why members did what
they  did.  At   times we   also realized  that  the player  logged   in was  not the  player   performing in  Whyville    as in
Isabel's case; the tracking data alone would never reveal such information. The observational data provided both
context and detail to players' interactions. The talk and movements captured in video and field notes often revealed
how and why players decided to meet at certain locations and thus initiated learning about teleporting.               The exit
interviews confirmed the role of others as support in learning about new features in online gaming.

         In what we would like to call `multi-streaming' the different data sources, we were able to reconstruct and
integrate a stream of complex interactions.       In our particular case, we were also able to combine quantitative and
qualitative data  sources   using  online  tracking  logfiles and  offline  observational   video  and   field note  data. This
allowed  us   to develop trajectories   of how   teleporting  insider knowledge   traveled   through the   player   community.
This  was  at first a  gradual   and then  nearly exponential     process through   which   all players  (with one   exception)
became   knowledgeable      of this  insider activity. We    also needed   to add   to this stream  of   data  our  own   player
experiences that were an instrumental part in understanding what the club members were talking about in Whyville.
While ethnographic analysis has always factored in the voice and role of the observer it is rarely complemented with
logfile analysis.

         Through this process of multi-streaming we were able to approximate one aspect of our research that is the
seamless integration of online and offline interactions. For rhetorical purposes, we often use these distinctions to
refer to different  data sources    but it was   clear from   our observations    that our  participants did   not  make   these
distinctions while being in Whyville. For them what happened online in Whyville was as much part of the same
activity structure as what happened in the after-school club. Other researchers have for that reason started referring
to synthetic worlds (Castronova, 2005) or as we have to synthetic play (Kafai, in press) to indicate the merging or
synthesizing nature of online and offline worlds. This study demonstrates that research methodologies need to be
adapted to match the complexities of interactions across the spaces of these worlds.
