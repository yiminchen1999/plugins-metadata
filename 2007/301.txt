          Abstract:   This   study    investigated  the effects   of group   member     familiarity during   computer-
          supported collaborative learning. Familiarity may have an impact on online collaboration, because
          it may help group members to progress more quickly through the stages of group development,
          and may lead to higher group cohesion. It was therefore hypothesized that increased familiarity
          would    lead  to (a) more  critical  and  exploratory   group    norms, (b)  more  positive  perceptions   of
          online   communication      and collaboration,   (c) more    efficient and   positive collaboration,   and  (d)
          better group   performance.     To   investigate these   hypotheses,   105   secondary    education   students
          collaborated   in  groups   of three. The   results  of  this study  indicate  that familiarity   led to more
          critical  and  exploratory     group  norm    perceptions,    and   more   positive   perceptions   of  online
          communication and collaboration. Furthermore, in familiar groups students needed to devote less
          time regulating their task-related activities. On the other hand, no effect of familiarity on group
          performance was found.

Introduction
          Over the past 20 years, research on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has helped support
the claim that collaborative activity among students can effectively be supported with computer technology. The
accumulated  knowledge       concerning    effective  CSCL     has also  led  to detailed  design   guidelines   for CSCL    (e.g.,
Kirschner,  Martens,     &  Strijbos, 2004).  In spite  of these   design   guidelines, researchers   still experience    problems
when    students    collaborate  using    computer    technology     (e.g., conflicts,  communication       difficulties, shallow
discussions). Although these problems may be caused by poor implementation of the design guidelines mentioned, it
may also be the case that research has focused too little on potential moderators that can influence the effectiveness
of CSCL (Hollingshead & McGrath, 1995) such as time spent on group work (e.g., one session versus prolonged
group work), task type (e.g., open versus closed tasks), group size (e.g., small versus large groups), and group or
student characteristics (e.g., estrangement versus familiarity of group members). For example, how well students
know each other prior to their collaboration may have an impact on several aspects of their collaboration (Kiesler &
Sproull, 1992). Ignoring such moderators may lead to inconsistent and contrasting results, making it very risky to
draw generalizations.

          The aim of this contribution is to examine the effect of one potential moderator, namely group member
familiarity. Kiesler and Sproull (1992) identified group member familiarity as an important factor to consider when
designing  CSCL.     The    effects   of familiarity  on  group    interaction   and   performance    are related  to aspects  of
Tuckman's (1965) stages of group formation: forming, storming, norming, and performing. It has been hypothesized
that when   group   members     know     each other well,  they   will  spend less time   forming   a coherent   group,   and will
establish group    norms    more easily,  and   thus, reach the   performing     stage more   quickly. This  is  thought  to  have
beneficial effects for, among others, satisfaction with online collaboration and group performance (Adams, Roch, &
Ayman, 2005).

          Although only a small number of studies has investigated the impact of group member familiarity on CSCL
(e.g., Adams     et al., 2005;   Mennecke,     Hoffer,  &   Valacich,    1995;   Smolensky,     Carmody,    &   Halcomb,   1990),
researchers have    identified   possible  positive   and  negative    consequences    of increased   familiarity  among     group
members.   For   example,    Adams    et  al.  (2005)   found  that  when    group   members    knew   each   other  better,  their
satisfaction with the group process increased, though       their decision accuracy decreased. Similarly, Smolensky et al.
(1990) found that familiarity had a negative impact on students' interactive behavior, which, in turn led to decreased
group performance. In contrast, Mukahi and Corbitt (2004) found no relationship between familiarity and students'
collaborative activities.

                                                                301                                                     CSCL 2007
          An explanation for the mixed results may be the different operationalizations of familiarity (Adams et al.,
2005). Adams et al., for example, following Gruenfeld, Mannix, Williams, and Neale (1996), asked students to rate
familiarity with group members on a 4-point scale. Smolensky et al. (1990), on the other hand, did not measure
familiarity  directly but asked   half of their  participants   to bring  two   friends to their experiment,   so as  to   create
familiar and unfamiliar groups, thus equating familiarity with friendship. In our opinion, students can be familiar
with each other without being friends. In this study, familiarity was operationalized by asking students, before the
start of their collaboration, to indicate how well they knew the other group members. This way, the collaboration
itself does not affect students' judgments of familiarity. On the other hand, asking students to rate familiarity before
the collaboration may draw attention to whether they worked with friends or strangers, which may also influence
students' collaborative behavior.

          Our study differed from previous studies on familiarity on several aspects. In contrast to other studies,
students  in our  sample  came    from   existing secondary     education  classes, thus   most  group members     knew    their
teammates to a certain extent, although variations obviously existed. In other studies, students were recruited from a
pool of   student volunteers   (Adams    et al., 2005). Additionally,     the study   presented  here was    carried out   in an
authentic educational context, in which students collaborated online for a longer period of time. In contrast, in other
studies the effects of familiarity were often examined in a single online session, while students worked on group
tasks with little or no relationship to the curriculum (e.g., Mennecke et al., 1995; Orengo Castellá, Zornoza Abad,
Prieto Alonso, & Peiró Silla, 2000). Furthermore, most studies that examined the role of familiarity during online
collaboration focused on either students' perceptions (e.g., their satisfaction with the collaborative process) or on
students' interactive   behavior  (e.g., use  of  negative  speech).    This  study   will focus  on  perceptions    as well  as
behavior.

          Thus, in order to extend the research findings concerning familiarity, this paper focuses on the effects of
familiarity on (a) perceived group norms, (b) perceptions of online collaboration and communication, (c) students'
collaborative activities, and (d) group performance. The remainder of this introduction focuses on describing the
possible effect familiarity may have on these four variables.

Group norms
          As groups    include group   members     who  are     more   familiar  with  one  another,  students  may     be more
comfortable  expressing   disagreement    (Gruenfeld  et   al., 1996).  As   such, familiarity may   help group   members     to
adopt critical or exploratory group norms instead of consensus norms (Postmes, Spears, & Cihangir, 2001). This is
important because critical or exploratory group discussions have been shown to lead to more effective group work
(Wegerif,   Mercer,   & Dawes,   1999).   During  critical group     discussion, students  do  not  hesitate to question   each
others' opinions, that is to disagree with one another (Postmes et al.). Exploratory group discussions are similar to
critical group discussions in the sense that students accept criticism from each other and discuss alternatives. In
addition, these   kinds  of discussions   should   be held    in   a constructive  manner.   In  other words,   conflicts   and
disagreements   are   welcome,  but    group members    should     try to resolve   them.  Furthermore,   during   exploratory
discussions group members share relevant information and encourage each other to participate (Wegerif et al.). It is
expected  that  familiar  group   members    will  be more      likely to develop     group norms    which   value   critical or
exploratory  online   discussions because    they do  not  feel  the  social  pressure  to agree with  other  group  members
(Adams et al., 2005). Unfamiliar group members may be more prone to adapt to such pressure. These critical or
exploratory versus consensual group norms will be developed in the norming stage of group formation (Tuckman,
1965). Thus, the following hypothesis may be formulated:

          H1 Group member familiarity will contribute to more critical and exploratory group norms.

Perceptions of online communication and collaboration
          In familiar groups, group cohesion will likely be higher because group members feel more comfortable
with the other members (Adams et al., 2005; Mennecke et al., 1995). Furthermore, when group members know each
other better, they may be able to communicate and collaborate efficiently (Adams et al.). This will lead familiar
group members to perceive their online communication and collaboration within their group as being more positive.
Students  may  also   perceive their   communication    and     collaboration more    positively in  familiar groups    because
psychological safety is higher in these groups (Van den Bossche, Gijselaers, Segers, & Kirschner, 2006). Indeed,
studies by Mennecke et al. and Adams et al. found more positive perceptions of communication and collaboration in
familiar groups. Therefore, a second hypothesis will be investigated:

                                                              302                                                    CSCL 2007
          H2  Group    member    familiarity    will lead to  positive  perceptions  regarding   the collaborative
          process.

Collaborative activities
          As familiarity between group members increases, communication and coordination of collaboration may
take less effort. For example, the transfer of information relevant to executing the task may be more efficient, and
misunderstandings may be less likely to occur. This can be explained by the higher amount of knowledge available
to familiar  group  members   of   other  member's    skills, expertise and  communication    styles (Adams   et  al., 2005).
Familiar group members may share a social history, making it easier to understand each other and know each other's
strengths and weaknesses. Similarly, familiarity may decrease the need for extensive regulation and coordination of
task and group processes. Consequently, a third hypothesis will also be investigated.

          H3 Group member familiarity will influence collaborative activities. More specifically, transfer of
          information, regulation of task and group processes, and misunderstandings will decrease, while
          indications of understanding will increase.

Group performance
          In light of the   above, it is likely that  the increased   knowledge   of group members'   skills  and   modes  of
interaction will help familiar groups outperform groups of strangers. For example, familiar groups will experience
less process loss (e.g., misunderstandings) and be more inclined to pool information resources to effectively carry
out the group task (Gruenfeld et al., 1996). Furthermore, if H1 is true, then familiar groups may hold more critical
and exploratory group norms, which help them engage in argumentative interactions. Finally, collaboration may be
more efficient because familiar groups do not need to devote as much time to regulating and coordinating task and
group processes. Therefore, this study will address a fourth and final hypothesis:

          H4 Group member familiarity will increase group performance.

Method and Instrumentation

Participants
          The participants were students who came from five different history classes from two secondary schools
working in small groups. The total sample consisted of 105 eleventh-grade students (47 male, 56 female). The mean
age of the students was 16.17 years (SD = .57, Min = 15, Max = 18). The participants were randomly assigned to 35
different 3-person groups. It is important to note that students were assigned to groups within their own class and did
not collaborate with students from other classes or schools.

Tasks and materials
CSCL-environment: Virtual Collaborative Research Institute
          Group   members    collaborated  in   a    CSCL-environment     called Virtual Collaborative  Research     Institute
(VCRI, see Figure 1), a groupware program designed to support collaborative learning on inquiry tasks and research
projects. VCRI    has  been  used  in   several research  projects (Janssen,   Erkens, & Kanselaar,   2007).  Students   used
VCRI to communicate with each other, access information sources, and co-author texts and essays. Teachers also
used the program to monitor online discussions and student progress. While working with VCRI, students share
several tools, such as a Sources-tool which contains information sources that students can use to gather important
information,  a   Chat-tool  for   synchronous     communication     with group   members,  a    Cowriter for shared     word
processing, which students can use to simultaneously compose their texts or answers, and a Diagrammer for making
external representations of ideas or arguments. Other tools not shown in Figure 1 include a Planner and a Logbook.

Inquiry group task
          Participants worked    on   a historical   inquiry task  on "The first four  centuries of  Christianity". The  task
consisted of three parts. First, the groups had to answer four different questions using 12 different historical sources.
To complete the second part of the task, the groups had to study 40 different information sources and categorize
them into    five different categories.  Students    had  to  decide  together on which  categories  they would     use. This
categorization had to be visualized in a diagram, using the VCRI-diagrammer. Finally, they had to co-write an essay

                                                               303                                                  CSCL 2007
of at least 1200 words. The essay had to explain why and how Christianity developed from a small `cult' into the
main religion of the Roman Empire. In sum, the group task was an open-ended task, without a standard procedure
and with no single correct answer.

Procedure
        In total, students devoted eight, 50-minute lessons to the inquiry task. During the lessons, each student
worked on a separate computer in a computer lab. Before the first computer lessons, students received information
about the task and  the group  composition.    Furthermore,   students completed  a pretest   questionnaire,  requesting
personal information (e.g., age, gender) and which asked them about how familiar they were with the other group
members (see Independent measure section below). During the computer lessons, teachers were standby to answer
task-related questions. In addition, students were allowed to work on the inquiry group-task during their free periods
in the schools' media centers. After the last lesson, a posttest questionnaire was administered containing items on
group norm perception and perception of online collaboration. Students expressed their opinions using a 5-point
scale ranging from 1 (= completely disagree) to 5 (= completely agree).

Independent measure: Familiarity
        Students' perceived familiarity with the other group members served as the independent measure for this
study. Based on work by Gruenfeld et al. (1996) and Adams et al. (2005), familiarity was measured by asking each
student, before the start of the collaboration, to rate his or her two other group members on a 4-point scale, ranging
from 1 (= do not him/her know at all) to 4 (= know him/her very well). This question was preceded by four specific
`yes/no' questions designed to remind students of situations which they had previously encountered with the other
group members in order to help them better judge group member familiarity. Subsequently, the two ratings for each
group member were summed to create an overall familiarity score, which reflected the level of familiarity of the
individual student with his or her group members. Thus, the familiarity score could range from 2 to 8.

        Sometimes however, group members disagreed as to how well they thought they knew each other. These
disagreements  may  undermine   the reliability of  the  familiarity measure. Therefore,   group  members'   familiarity
ratings of each other were compared. An agreement percentage of 64% was found (Cohen's  = .50). However, this
interrater reliability is a strict measure of reliability, because differences of one point (e.g., one student rated his
familiarity with the other with a three, while the other gave a four) are considered disagreements. Therefore, we
computed  a correlation between    students' familiarity ratings of  each other. This correlation  between   familiarity
ratings of group members was highly significant (r = .79, p < .01), which shows that there was consistency between
group members'    familiarity ratings. This    also points to  an    adequate reliability of  the familiarity measure.
Additionally, the validity of the  familiarity measure   was  examined   by correlating   the sum of the four  `yes/no'

                                                          304                                                  CSCL 2007
questions (higher scores reflect higher familiarity) with the familiarity measure. A significant correlation was found
(r = .70, p < .01). This provides evidence for the validity of the overall familiarity score.

Dependent measures
Questionnaire data
         To  investigate hypotheses  1  and  2, data from  the  posttest questionnaire  were    used. The  questionnaire
contained three scales for group norm perceptions, and three scales for perception of online collaboration, which are
summarized in Table 1. All of the scales had adequate reliability coefficients. Thus, for all scales students' ratings
on the individual items were averaged to create a mean score.

Collaborative activities
         To examine the influence of familiarity on collaborative activities, a coding scheme (Janssen et al., 2007)
was used to gain insight into the task- and group-related processes carried out during students' online collaboration.
The scheme    contained  four  dimensions:  task-related activities, regulation of  task-related,  social  activities, and
regulation of social activities. Each dimension contained two or more coding categories. Furthermore, the scheme
included several additional categories (e.g., technical aspects) that did not belong to any of the four dimensions. In
total, the scheme consisted of 19 categories. Table 2 shows all coding scheme codes. Two researchers determined
the interrater reliability of the coding procedure, by independently coding 796 collaborative activities. The overall
Cohen's  was .94. The category Kappas (Cicchetti, Lee, Fontana, & Dowds, 1978) are also given in Table 2.

Group performance scores
         To measure the effect of familiarity on group performance, an assessment form was developed for each part
of the  inquiry task. The  assessment    form for the   first part  addressed  (1)  conceptual   content  and quality   of
argumentation of the answers, and (2) quality of the presentation of the answers. Conceptual content and quality of
argumentation were assessed using one item on a 4-point scale. Quality of the presentation was assessed using five
items (e.g., correctness of the language used, structure of the written answer) that were rated on a 3-point scale. The
assessment   form for the second   part  of the task part consisted   of three  items  which   assessed  the quality   and
completeness of the constructed diagram and the quality of the explanation. These items were also rated on a 3-
point scale. For the last part of the inquiry task, group members needed to collectively write an essay. Comparable
to part one, conceptual content and quality of argumentation were assessed using three items rated on a 3-point
scale. Quality of the presentation of the essay was assessed using five items on a 3-point scale. This was done in a
similar fashion as for   part one of the inquiry  task. To    check the objectivity of the    assessment  procedure,   two
researchers scored seven inquiry tasks. The results of reliability analysis were satisfactory, as Cohen's  ranged from
.73 to .90.

Results

Group norm perception
         Table  3 shows  the means  and   standard deviations   of familiarity and  the three measures   of group    norm
perception,  and their intercorrelations. As can  be seen from   this Table, students   reported an   average  familiarity
(M = 4.24,   SD = 1.48) with their group   members.    Furthermore,   familiarity correlated  significantly with   several

         Because the data were nested (i.e., students worked in groups), and because there was interdependence
between group members' scores (i.e., group members could influence each other) multilevel analysis was used to
examine the effects of familiarity (Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006). The results of these analyses are summarized in
Table 4. The - and t-values show that familiarity had a significant positive effect on students' perceived critical and
exploratory group norms. Students who knew their other group members well, reported higher perceived critical and
exploratory group norms. No effect was found for familiarity on consensual group norm perceptions.

1     105     I think those 4 sub questions are good. So they are definitive?
2     105     OK I'm going to think along with you guys
3     104     Which conflicts and differing opinions were there within the Christian community?
4     104     Yeah sounds okay.
5     106     Hmm, that last one is kinda difficult, because the sub questions have to relate to the main
              question.
6     104     Those first 5.
7     104     Yeah, right.
8     104     How did the conflicts within Christianity influence its development?
9     104     Or something like that
10    106     Yea, perfect! :D
11    104     Ok.
12    104     Wait a minute...
13    105     That will be the fifth.
14    104     I'll sum it all up.
15    104     1) How did Christianity originate and how did it develop? 2) Why did pagans convert to
              Christianity? 3) What are the principles of Christianity? 4) What kinds of persecutions did the
              early Christians suffer and why? 5) How did the conflicts among Christians influence its
              development?
16    106     Nice!

The two fragments illustrate these differences between low and high familiarity groups. The first fragment below
shows a low familiarity group discussing questions they are going to address in their essay. As can be seen, each
time a student proposes a question (lines 3, 8, and 15), this is quickly accepted by the other students. In contrast, in
fragment 2 the group members are constantly critical of each others' proposals (e.g, lines 6, 8, 10, 13, and 17). These
fragments illustrate the abovementioned finding that in high familiarity groups, students adhered to more critical and
exploratory group norms. In summary, there seems to be sufficient evidence to support H1.

5     115     We should first make those 5 categories, right?
6     113     Shouldn't we decide on them while reading?
7     113     Like, you could think of them then.
8     115     Yeah, when you decide on a category based on 1 source, the rest may not fit within that category.
9     115     If we just think of 5 categories, we can divide all sources over those five.

11     115     Christianity?
12     114     Sharp... reeeeally sharp!
13     113     No, I think we better discuss those categories after we read it all.
14     115     But then you have to remember 13 sources.
15     115     How we'll categorize them?
16     114     OK, but how are we going to categorize it?
17     113     Yeah, but can't you just think of 5 while reading?
18     114     This sucks!

Perception of online collaboration and communication
          The effect of familiarity on group members' perceptions of their online behavior is also reported in Table 4.
Familiarity   had a    significant positive effect on   both  perceptions  of  positive group    behavior  and perceived
effectiveness of group task strategies. Thus, students who are familiar with their fellow group members perceive
their collaboration as more positive and rate their group task strategies as more effective. Furthermore, familiarity
was found to have a significant negative effect on perceptions of negative group behavior. This indicates that in
familiar groups, students report less negative group behavior. In sum, these findings support H2.

Collaborative activities
          When analyzing the effect of familiarity on students' collaborative activities, two predictors were added to
the multilevel model. In addition to familiarity, the number of chat messages typed was also included in the model to
account for the fact that some groups typed more messages than others. By including this predictor, the effect of the
familiarity could be investigated independent of number of messages typed by students. Familiarity was found to be
a significant predictor for several collaborative activities. On the one hand it had significant positive effects on (a)
social support   (SociSupp,  = 1.72,   p = .05),  and  (b)  social resistance  messages (SociResi,   = 1.61, p < .00). In
contrast, familiarity led to significantly less (a) task-related questions (TaskQues,  = -0.78, p = .04), (b) monitoring
of task activities (MTaskMoni,  = -1.99, p = .01), (c) positive evaluations of task activities (MTaskEvl+,  = -0.59,
p = .03), (d) greetings   (SociGree,   = -1.30,   p = .00), and  (e) messages   indicating loss  of shared understanding
(SociUnd-,  = -0.75, p = .03). These results are mostly in line with H3.

Group performance
          To examine the last hypothesis, each group received performance scores for the different parts of the group
task. Since these scores were given for the entire group, familiarity ratings also needed to be aggregated to the
group-level   by  summing   the    familiarity ratings that each   student gave  to his or  her  group  members.  These
aggregated familiarity ratings were subsequently used as a predictor for group performance. Because in this case,
both variables were at the same level, namely the group-level, ordinary regression analyses were used instead of
multilevel analyses. The results of the regression analyses are given in Table 5. As can be seen, no significant effects
of familiarity on group performance were found.     Thus there seems to be no evidence to support H4.

Conclusions and discussion
          This study investigated the effect of familiarity on CSCL. The results indicate that familiarity influences
several aspects of online collaboration. Because familiar group members may be more comfortable expressing their
disagreement with their teammates, it was expected that higher familiarity would be associated with more critical
and  exploratory group   norm   perceptions  (H1).    This  was  confirmed.  Furthermore,    because  it   was  expected  that
familiar groups would communicate and collaborate more fluidly and efficiently, more positive perceptions of the
online communication and collaboration process were also anticipated. Indeed, our analyses confirmed that higher
levels of  familiarity were  associated   with   more  positive  perceptions   and less  negative  perceptions   (H2).  Also,
familiarity was expected to influence students' collaborative activities (H3). Indeed, some expected effects were
found. For example, higher familiarity was associated with fewer task-related questions, possibly due to the fact that
communication is more efficient in those groups. Also, students who reported high levels of familiarity devoted less
time   to monitoring   task-related  activities.  Again,   this may   be  explained  by   the  fact   that coordination   and
communication and collaboration are more efficiently performed in familiar groups. This is also supported by the
fact that students in familiar groups sent fewer messages indicating a loss of shared understanding, for example
because there were fewer communication problems and ambiguities. On the other hand, familiar group members
also exchanged   more   messages    containing   a negative  accent.  This may   again   be caused   by  the fact  that group
members are more comfortable communicating with each other, and are thus also more likely to voice negative
opinions (Gruenfeld et al., 1996). This finding mirrors the finding by Smolensky et al. (1990) that familiarity tended
to increase negative speech. It is, however, interesting to note that in familiar groups positive messages were also
sent more often. The last hypothesis (H4) addressed the influence of familiarity on group performance. However, no
effect on performance was found. This is surprising, because familiar students reported more critical group norm
perceptions, perceived the collaboration more positively, and needed to devote less effort to coordination and asking
questions. This may be explained in several ways. First, familiar students also engaged in negative interactions more
often, which may have had a counterproductive effect. These negative interactions can undermine group climate and
group collaboration, ultimately resulting in a decreased group performance. Previous research seems to confirm this
assumption, as Wilson, Straus, and McEvily (2006) found that negative interactions decreased trust among group
members,   while Smolensky    et al. (1990)    found  a  negative  relationship between   negative   interactions  and  group
performance.

          Several limitations of this study should be kept in mind. First, this study was set up as a quasi-experiment.
Students were not assigned to either low or high familiarity conditions based on students' ratings of all of their
classmates.  Rather,   they were first   randomly     assigned  to groups  before  their  familiarity with   each  other was
established. This resulted in a somewhat skewed division of low versus high familiarity groups (8 groups of three
strangers, 19  groups  with  one familiar   relationship   and  two   stranger relationships,  3 groups    with two  familiar
relationships and one stranger relationship, and 5 groups consisting of three students who were all familiar with each
other). This skewed division may have had an impact on our results. Second, students in this study were 15 to 18
years old. At this age, students may be sensitive to social and peer factors (c.f., Leaper & Smith, 2004), which may
influence  the impact  of   familiarity. Older or  younger   students  may  behave  differently   in  familiar  or unfamiliar
settings. Third, an effect of familiarity on critical and exploratory group norms perceptions was found. This study
did not investigate in depth whether students' online discussions also reflected these group norms. In other words,
students perceived their discussions to be more critical and exploratory, but we do not for sure know if this actually
was the case. If there is a difference between students' perceptions and actual behavior (e.g., students report they are
more critical, when in fact they are not), this may be an additional explanation for why no influence of familiarity
was  found   on group   performance.     On the    other hand,  we  were   able to provide    collaboration  fragments    that
illustrated the expected differences between low and high familiarity groups. This may also help to explain why
familiar groups did not outperform unfamiliar groups. In sum, the mentioned limitations emphasize the need for
additional research into the possibly differential effects of familiarity.

          The  goal of educational   innovation    is to make   learning  more  efficient so  that  learners learn  the same
amount of material in a shorter time span, and/or make learning more effective so that learners learn more in the
same time span, and/or make learning more enjoyable such that the affective learning experience is pleasing and
learners will want to learn (Kirschner, 2004). Educational research in general and CSCL-research in particular tend
to focus  on  determining   how  specific  tools,  environments,   or student  characteristics affect either   the effectivity
and/or efficiency of online collaboration. In the research reported here, although familiarity was not found to have
an effect on group performance, it still had very important positive consequences for the way students collaborated
in a CSCL     environment.   Familiarity   clearly  led  to a   more  enjoyable   collaborative  experience    among    group

members. When composing online groups, familiarity of group members should therefore definitively be taken into
account.
