         Abstract:   This paper  reports  an empirical experiment    that examined   the effects of  cooperative
         computer-based math game playing, in comparison to cooperative paper-and-pencil drilling, on
         cognitive,  metacognitive,   and   motivational math    learning  outcomes.     141 5th  graders  were
         randomly assigned to the two experimental groups and undertook the treatment activities for eight
         45-minute sessions during four weeks. The results indicated that game-based cooperative learning
         context was more effective in promoting positive attitudes toward math.

Introduction
         Despite the large number of studies about the use of instructional games alone and cooperative learning
alone, studies combining these two variables are still limited.    According to Crook (1994), computing technology
may  serve  to support  cooperation   by  providing students with  something  he   calls points  of shared reference. He
further claims that in a traditional classroom situation there are not enough anchor points available at which action
and attention can be coordinated for successful cooperation.     In agreement with Crook's argument, an examination
of the capability of using computer-based games as a mediating tool that help students to focus their attention to
mutually  shared  objects   (Jarvela, Bonk,  Lehtinen  &   Lehti,  1999),  thus enhancing     their cooperative  learning
experiences, is warranted.

         A major finding of the reviews and meta-analyses of CSCL studies (Cavanaugh, 2001; Whelan & Plass,
2002) is that there are very few real experimental studies comparing learning outcomes in between computer based
and traditional learning situations.  In most of the studies on CSCL the authors described the computer tools used
and the working processes, but there was seldom rigorous experimental evidence about the effects of these learning
environments.   On   one  hand,  the  developers of  CSCL    environments   were   able  to  obtain a rich view  into the
interaction and  collaborative  knowledge-building    processes  through   content analysis,    ethnographic approaches,
discourse analysis, as well as social network analysis; on the other hand, it is difficult to extract generalized main
findings from   this rich qualitative  data  (Koschman,  Hall,   & Miyake,   2002).     Therefore,  using  the traditional
experimental model of evaluating the effectiveness of the CSCL environment (such as cooperative learning around
computer-based math games) is still a critical and complementary approach for the research community.

Research Purpose and Design
         This  research investigated   whether   cooperative computer-based     math  game   playing,  in  comparison  to
cooperative   paper-and-pencil  drilling,  would  be  more   effective in   facilitating comprehensive     math  learning
outcomes.   A  pretest-posttest experimental   design  was used   to examine  the  effects   of two cooperative  learning
contexts (computer game-based playing and traditional paper-and-pencil drilling) on participants' performance at
the criterion  measures   ­ standards-based   math   exam  performance,    attitudes questionnaire,   and  metacognitive
awareness survey responses.

Participants
         141 5th graders were recruited from four rural school districts in America.      Participants varied in gender,
socio economic status, and prior math ability level: 51% were female, 38% were economically disadvantaged, and
43% were below proficiency in prior math ability level.

Computer-Based Math Games Used
         ASTRA    EAGLE      was  a   series of  web-based   math    games  developed    by  the  Center   for Advanced
Technologies at one of the sampled school districts.   The games were designed to reinforce academic standards for
mathematics required by Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA), which is a standards-based criterion-
referenced  assessment  required by   all public schools in  the Commonwealth      of Pennsylvania.    The   games were
developed as single-player games using Macromedia's Flash and can run in any recent major Web browser.

                                                           354                                                  CSCL 2007
        In this study, four mathematics games within the ASTRA EAGLE set that target 5th grade students were
used. These mathematics learning games contained a variety of tasks targeting math concepts comprehension and
skills application. Most tasks were contextualized in roles and actions relevant to school students.         For instance, in a
game called "Up, Up, & Away" children acted as pilots who traveled by balloon.               One problem embedded in the
game was to estimate the traveling speed, "If the balloon was traveling at 14 miles per hour and then sped up by a
factor of 2 and then added another 1 miles per hour, how fast would it be traveling?"         Another example was the task
of locating X and Y coordinates in a game called "Treasure Hunt", where game players could follow a hint "Go to
X15, Y3 on the map" to dig for treasure.      Immediate feedbacks were provided upon students' actions.           The games
were challenging: children had to push themselves to beat the computer game or get to the next highest level.

Instruments
        A   36-item   "Game   Skills Arithmetic    Test (GSAT)"     was   constructed   based  on  the PSSA.     It measured
cognitive math   skills that the computer   games  were     designed  to  reinforce.  The GSAT test was web-based and
comprised 36 multiple-choice questions.     A panel of 5th grade math teachers from the sampled school districts had
vetted the content validity of the test questions. The KR-20 reliability of the test in this study was .86. An inventory
on attitudes toward the subject matter was a modification of Tapia's "Attitudes Towards Math Inventory" (ATMI,
Tapia & Marsh, 1996).     This five-point Likert-scaled inventory is a 40-item survey, investigating students' feelings
toward  mathematics     according  to  four identified   factors   labeled   as: self-confidence,   value,   enjoyment,   and
motivation. The KR-20 reliability of the inventory in this study was .97. Metacognitive skill were measured by the
Junior Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (Jr. MAI) Version A (Sperling, et al. 2002).           The Jr. MAI Version A is a
12-item self-report  questionnaire   about  the way   students    learn,  intended  for  use in grades  three    through five.
Respondents are required to estimate on a 3-point Likert scale (1 = never; 3 = always) the frequency with which they
engage in metacognition when learning and studying.         The instrument's reliability in this study was .65.

Procedures and Treatments
        The researcher with the teachers administered GSAT, ATMI, and Jr. MAI as a pretest.                  Participants then
were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups: cooperative game-playing group and cooperative
paper-and-pencil drilling group.     Participants received orientation to familiarize themselves with the cooperative
learning task, and if applicable, the math games environment.       Participants then were then required to play one math
game during two 45-minute sessions each week for four weeks or do equivalent paper-and-pencil math drills during
two 45-minute sessions each week for four weeks.
   1.   Cooperative     game  playing:  A  close   simulation   of  the  Teams-Games-Tournament        cooperative   learning
        strategy (DeVries & Slavin, 1976) was used.          Specifically, students were stratified by their math ability
        level and gender, and then randomly assigned to a four- or five-member team.              At the beginning of each
        game session, students collaborated with teammates for 15 minutes: sitting before the same computer and
        practicing with the games.     For the remainder of the 30 minutes, game teams then competed against one
        another; each team member was assigned to a desktop computer at a tournament table to play against other
        teams' representatives.    At  any  tournament      table the students   were  roughly  comparable    in achievement
        level.   At  the end  of every  gaming   session,   the   players at each  table compared   their  gaming   scores to
        determine their rank order which was then converted into points.           The points that the players earned were
        added  to   compute   a  team  score.   The   team   scores   were   ranked  and listed in  a  class newsletter,  and
        distributed to the class at the beginning of next treatment session.     Top team got a winner certificate.
   2.   Cooperative     paper-and-pencil    drilling:   Like  cooperative    game     playing  group,  participants   formed
        heterogeneous teams (mixed in ability and gender) and did teams-games-tournament activities.                The only
        difference is they did paper-and-pencil math drills instead of game playing.          Drill questions were retrieved
        from the four math games in ASTRA EAGLE and printed on paper sheets.

        After  four-week     experiment treatments,     all participants  retook   the  GSAT    math   test, ATMI    attitudes
inventory, and Jr. MAI metacognitive awareness inventory in the posttest.

Results
        A single Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted to examine the main effects of
the cooperative learning contexts (computer-based game playing versus paper-and-pencil drilling on Game Skills
Arithmetic  Test (GSAT)      performance,  Junior  Metacognitive      Awareness   Inventory   score (JrMAI),   and  Attitudes

toward Math Inventory score (ATMI).             Participants' pre-treatment scores in GSAT, JrMai, and ATMI were used as
covariates. The MANCOVA results indicated overall significant effects of the cooperative learning contexts on the
outcome variables of mathematical learning, F (3, 134) = 5.03, p < .01.                   The results also indicated that cooperative
computer-based game playing facilitated positive attitudes toward math learning significantly more than cooperative
paper drilling (F (1, 136) = 14.50, p < .001), but its advantage on cognitive math test performance and metacognitive
awareness was not significant (p > .05).          Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the two experimental groups in
terms  of ATMI    attitudes toward   math        inventory   score, GSAT        math    test performance,  and   JrMai metacognitive
awareness inventory score.

          Based on  this   study results,        it could   be  argued        that using   computer-based   educational   game  as  a
motivational tool for cooperative learning is more convincing than using it as a cognitive or metacognitive one.
There was no enough statistical evidence suggesting that computer-based game playing will facilitate or obstruct
cooperative learning.   However, it should be noted that the games used in this study were originally designed as
single-player games.    The  game    characteristics       of a  single-player      game   may   influence its supremacy   in serving
cooperative  learning format.    Therefore          cautions  should       be exercised   when   generalizing  the  study findings to
interpret the interdependence between a multiplayer game and cooperative learning context.
