          Process Gain: A Task on Which Real Groups Outperformed
Individuals Modeled Under Perfect-Knowledge-Sharing Assumptions

          An experiment with university students examined effects of two versions of a statistics task on
          individual versus group  learning.  Using   a novel  measure     of transfer, groups were  found     to
          outperform,  on   average,  individuals  modeled    as  groups    under   perfect-knowledge-sharing
          assumptions.    To   my knowledge,    this is  the  first result   of its kind,  and  it suggests    a
          characterization of naturally productive collaborative tasks.

          Process loss occurs when a group performs worse than their capability due to a member with the correct
answer being silent or ignored by the other group  members (Steiner, 1972).     The idea is that something in the group
process must have caused the group not to recognize and take up the correct answer even though it was available to
them. This is a pattern frequently noted in small group interactions (e.g. Barron, 2003), and it continues to be a
concern of educators and researchers looking to implement effective collaborative learning activities.

          If groups performed up to their potential, then ideally, every member within a group would perform at least
as well as the best member of their group. One way that this could occur is if the students in a group selected the top
performer in their group to do every problem and explain the answers until everyone in the group understood them.
I am not suggesting this is an ideal form of cooperation; far from it.  Instead, it seems like an important and
attainable benchmark.  Currently, most-competent-member levels of performance are rare and      noteworthy (e.g.
Laughlin, Zander, Knievel, & Tan, 2003).

          Even top performers are wrong sometimes, so their performance can be surpassed.      If every  member of a
group shared their knowledge perfectly with one another, and they could all recognize a correct solution when they
saw it, then they would outperform or at least equal the top individual.   This hypothetical scenario reflects what
should happen under perfect-knowledge-sharing, and it is known as the truth-wins scenario.     Unlike the most-
competent-member model, whenever any individual in the group has the correct answer, it is assumed that the whole
group will take up that answer. Ideally, collaborative activities would naturally promote perfect-knowledge-sharing
amongst group members such that truth-wins levels of performance were achieved.

          Of course, we would like groups to be able to construct new understanding by building upon each
member's insights and incomplete conceptualizations.    This achievement is known as process gain because
something in the group interaction leads students to a new understanding that no individual had before working
together. When process gain occurs, it is possible for groups to exceed    even truth-wins levels of performance.   Such
results have been obtained in group performance tasks.   For example, Schwartz (1995) found that dyads were more
likely to make a conceptual shift on a gear modeling performance task than individuals modeled under truth-wins
assumptions.  On learning tasks, case studies have shown instances of building insight and knowledge construction
between group members (Yackel, Cobb, & Wood, 1991); however, to my knowledge no study has shown a task on
which the average group member exceeded truth-wins levels of performance.

          Finding and characterizing a type of learning task that naturally yielded process gain could be theoretically
and educationally significant. According to recent survey results, despite many teachers knowing of means of
structuring productive collaborations, they often do not implement them because they are already so busy (Antil,
Jenkins, Wayne, & Vadasy, 1998).     Below is a study of a statistics task for college students designed on the
innovation and efficiency framework of Schwartz, Bransford, and Sears (2005).       It was hypothesized that tasks with
an opportunity for innovation followed by efficient instruction might yield naturally productive interactions and,
thereby, process gain.

Methods
          Participants--Seventy-six  university students with  little   or no background   in statistics were   randomly
assigned to one of two conditions: Innovation or Efficiency.     Participants either worked alone (40) or in same-sex
pairs (36). Forty-eight women (24 in dyads) and 28 men (12 in dyads) participated.

                                                          642                                                   CSCL 2007
         Materials--A nine-page learning packet about the chi-square formula and a seven-item posttest made up
the materials for this experiment.    The learning packet consisted of three units about different aspects of the chi-
square formula.    Each unit contained three pages: a Lesson page, a Problems page, and a Final Practice Example
page with answers provided at the bottom of the page.         For Innovation, the sequence of pages for each unit was: 1)
Problems, 2) Lesson, and 3) Final Practice Example.        For Efficiency, the sequence was: 1) Lesson, 2) Problems, and
3) Final Practice Example.   In other words, Innovation had to try to figure out a formula before getting the       canonical
solution while Efficiency received the formula and had a chance to apply it.

         A key feature of these materials was that the Problems pages had contrasting cases designed to highlight
key features of the formula(s).  For example, if students did not divide by the expected value for the problems in the
first unit, then two    of the three  contrasting    cases   would  yield  the same   value.   Not many    students   would
spontaneously realize the need to divide by the expected value, but when they were shown to do so in the lesson,
they should recognize its importance.   It was expected that participants in the Innovation condition would be more
likely to notice and learn from these contrasts than those in the Efficiency condition.

         Time   participants  spent on the   learning     packet and  time  on  the posttest was  recorded.   The    posttest
consisted of seven problems of three types.      Two problems required calculations of the chi-square formula, three
involved comprehension questions about where and how the formula works, and two involved a difficult transfer to
the related statistics topic of inter-rater reliability. An important feature of these far transfer measures was that they
were   designed  in PFL    fashion (Bransford   &    Schwartz,   1999;  Schwartz    & Martin,  2004).  The    first problem
introduced the new type of problem while the second provided a more difficult case in which those same principles
applied.  The PFL idea is that only participants who were prepared to learn from the first problem, the resource
problem, would be able to answer the second one, the target problem, correctly.              This approach allows one to
estimate what kinds of instruction are better at preparing students for future learning.

         Procedures--Table     2   summarizes   the  procedures.     To keep    participants from blurring  the  distinction
between conditions, they were told to complete each page in the packet before going to the next page and to look
back only if necessary (such as to recall the formula).      The experimenter instructed participants to spend 25 minutes
on the posttest, that it was difficult, to try their best, and to work alone.  Some participants finished early, and none
took  longer than   30  minutes.   No significant differences between conditions were found on time taken for the
learning packet or the posttest.

Results
         Each   of  the seven  problems on   the  posttest    had  multiple  components  that  could  receive points.   For
example, did the participant divide by the expected value?         Did they calculate the expected value and the chi-square
formula correctly?   Did they show negative transfer by applying the chi-square formula blindly where it did not
belong?     The coding scheme showed high inter-rater reliability (93% agreement, minimum agreement of 80% on
any item, Cohen's Kappas above 0.81 for each type of question: calculation, comprehension, and far-transfer).           The
reliability of the test was also high (alpha = .81).

         As expected, participants in the Innovation condition outperformed those in the Efficiency condition on the
far transfer problems   while  performing  similarly      on the calculation and  comprehension    problems,  as shown   in
Figure 2.   Some may argue that the better performance of the Innovation condition on the transfer problems was
simply due to "greater messing around."      The data suggest otherwise.     Innovation participants made fewer negative
transfer errors than their Efficiency counterparts   ((1)   = 5.40, p = .020). In other words, they were better at adapting

their knowledge to solve novel problems, and they better understood when the chi-square formula did not apply.
Perhaps most importantly, on the preparation for future learning (PFL) measure the Innovation condition not only
outperformed the Efficiency condition, the Innovation dyads outperformed their individual peers--both on average,
and under truth-wins assumptions.                                  These results are shown in Figure 3 where Innovation "nominal" dyads' and
Efficiency "nominal" dyads' scores were calculated based on the performance of the individuals from the Innovation
and                        Efficiency conditions,     respectively.          Those      interested in how       the truth-wins          calculation  was  performed          can

Conclusion
                               In the field of collaborative learning, many important discoveries have been made about effective methods
for obtaining educational benefits from group work.                                         Teachers often do not implement some of the research-based
structures for making collaborative activity effective (Antil et al., 1998).                                          This study took an alternative approach,
examining                        what  types       of tasks     might       naturally    support   productive       collaboration.         Using     the innovation          and
efficiency framework of Schwartz et al. (2005), two versions of a statistics task for college students were developed.
The efficiency version followed traditional lesson-then-practice methods while the innovation version included an
opportunity for inventing solutions to contrasting cases prior to receiving the lesson.                                                     The innovation condition
significantly outperformed the efficiency condition on far-transfer problems, and innovation dyads exceeded the
performance of their individual peers modeled as dyads under perfect-knowledge-sharing assumptions.
