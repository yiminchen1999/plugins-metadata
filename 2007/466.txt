Abstract: On the one hand, researchers have studied factors that influence collaboration and on the other, researchers
have  proposed    models   of  collaborative  problem   solving.    However,     we   have  not   found research    on the   relation
between these factors and the dimensions used in order to describe the collaborative activity within the models. This
article's goal is to propose such relations for a situation of collaborative design, mediated by computer and carried
out  at a distance.   We  will  show    two  main  relations   that emerged     from  our   corpus. Firstly,  dialogue   utterances
between   partners   that have  a  dominant   social aspect    are  positively   related to the   symmetry    of  the entire dyadic
interaction  in   terms   of partners'   contributions.    Secondly,     dialogue   utterances    that predominantly     deal  with
expressing what partners are doing is negatively related to the extent to which partners are aligned. This research
also extends the field of applicability of the cooperative activity model proposed in Baker (2002).

Introduction
          The   models    of cooperation    elaborated in  domains     dealing   with problem     resolution  aided   by computers
focus on a variety of phenomena. For example, they address spatial aspects of virtual worlds (Benford, Bullock,
Cook,   Harvey,   Ingram    &  Lee   (1993),  decision  processes     carried   out through    a  distributed information    system
(Gachet & Haettenschwiler, 2003) or forms of cooperation as reflected by dyadic interactions (Baker, 2002).

          This last model of cooperation -- the only full-fledged model amongst those cited above -- is interesting in
that it distinguishes different forms of cooperation within a dyad. Making these forms explicit helps us to understand
how participants organize themselves when they solve a problem together. This organization is a function of the
dimensions of activity that make up the model. From the moment that these forms are defined, it becomes possible
to evaluate which of them characterize those interactions that are favorable for learning (Jakobsson, 2002; Burton,
Brna & Treasure-Jones, 1996; Baker, 2002). Alternatively, it becomes possible to study which forms of cooperation
would produce a final product of greater quality, for example in the case of design. But on which basis should we
choose   the dimensions    of  activity that  are used  to  elaborate    the forms  of   cooperation?   And   what   factors can   be
related to these dimensions and in consequence, influence the forms of cooperation?

A model of cooperative activity and factors influencing cooperation
          In the  conceptual   model    of  cooperative activity    during   problem   resolution  described    by  Baker,   (2002),
three   principal phenomena     appear   upon    observing    people   that  work   together:  1)  different  responsibilities    and
contributions,    2) the  way   in which    people   carry    out  their work    together   (e.g. each   person's    speed,  mutual
understanding), and finally 3) the presence or absence of agreement. The objective of Baker's model is to establish a
link  between   cooperative    activity and   learning through     the   combination   of   three fundamental     dimensions:     role
symmetry, alignment and agreement. (cf. Table 1).

Table 1. The fundamental dimensions of Baker's (2002) model of forms of cooperation

Dimension               Definition
Degree of symmetry      For  a given continuous   sequence  of  interaction, the similarity or difference in  the responsibilities of
                        participants in regards to the accomplishment of sub-tasks, such as is manifested in verbal or non-verbal
                        communication, linked to material resources.
Degree of               The  difference  in  propositional  attitudes  (belief, non-belief, acceptance,   non-acceptance)    that  are
agreement               manifested  publicly, in  relation to  the different  aspects of  cooperative  activity  of problem  solving
                        (solutions, goals, methods, actions).
Degree of alignment     The extent to which partners are "in phase", in relation to aspects of their cooperative problem solving
                        (phases, degree of mutual comprehension, conceptualization of problem).

          In the case where the values of the dimensions are binary (e.g. symmetrical / non-symmetrical, etc.), the
three dimensional space corresponds to eight specific forms of cooperation (cf.             Figure 1).

                                                                redrawn from Baker (2002).

           A study of the literature revealed factors that contribute in diverse ways to collaboration. However, they are
not put into relation with a model that describes the forms of collaborative activity through precise dimensions, such
as those in Baker's model (see above). This is the objective of our article. We organized the factors we found in the
literature into two   types: internal  and             external.    Each   type   of   factor   contains       examples        of different      granularity. In
regards to internal factors, a factor can be internal to the individual or internal to the interaction between individuals.

           The factors that are internal to the individual are for example, self-efficacy (Bandura, 1994), adherence to
the working     principle,   altruism  or             favorable        opinion  of   collaboration           as an       approach          to problem    solving
(Suangsuwan, Wiratchai, & Wongwanich, 2006). There are also numerous factors internal to the interaction between
individuals.   For example,    the  structuring                 of  communication       at a    distance        (Baker       &  Lund,         1997), the socio-
institutional roles of participants (Lund, 2003), the exchanges of a social nature at the beginning of an interaction
(van Amelsvoort & Andriessen 2003), and finally the extent to which participants take into account non-verbal body
language (Gregori & Brassac, 2001) are all correlated with diverse ways of describing how collaboration occurs.

           The external factors of a technological, cultural, organizational, physiological and economical type can also
influence  the  ways   actions are  carried              out    in collaborative  and   distributed          communities        (Strauss       (1993), cited  by
Fjuk & Dirckinck-Homfeld, 1997). Concerning finer grained external factors, the availability of material resources
can influence the way in which collaboration evolves: (Scott, Mandryk & Inkpen, 2002). In addition, the control of a
resource (e.g. the manipulation of a video) can be determined by the seat one chooses (Krafft & Dausendschön-Gay,
1999).

           The  first type of  factor (internal)                and  more   specifically,     the factors       that      are  internal       to the interaction
between    individuals  will retain our             attention      for the research     presented  here.        In      what   follows,       we apply Baker's
model (2002) to two new corpora, gathered in two design situations (a pilot study and a principal experiment), both
mediated by computer and at a distance. The dimensions that constitute the forms of cooperative activity (symmetry,
accord & alignment) are distinguished according to a methodology adapted to our corpora and from this, we deduce
a subset of possible forms of cooperative activity. An analysis of the first corpus identified three factors internal to
the interaction between individuals that were correlated with different forms of cooperation in Baker's model. These
correlations were tested on the second corpus. In the following sections, we present our methodology, our results
and interpretations. Finally, we present our conclusions and our perspectives for this research.

Methodology, analyses and results
           In this section we briefly describe our pilot study and show how the results enabled us to form hypotheses
about the  correlation  of   specific forms              of     collaborative  activity  with   three        factors     internal       to interaction between
individuals. These hypotheses are tested in the principal study, also described below.

                                                                              467                                                                      CSCL 2007
Pilot study
       Here,    we describe the   participants, their prescribed  task, the resources  they had    at their  disposal, the
experimental protocol, the corpus    obtained, the analyses   carried out (coding of  interactions and  determination   of
forms of cooperative activity), our results and finally our observations and hypotheses.

Participants, task and resources
       Six university students, non-experts of origami, but experienced in working on computers, formed the three
observed dyads. The participants were asked to compose a procedural text for folding an origami paper hen. They
carried out this task on the Internet, each on his or her own computer. The participants did not know each other
before the experiment and were asked not to attempt to identify their partner, once they connected. Lack of available
computer rooms meant that in reality, participants were all in the same computer room, although they were told they
were each connected to a person in another location.

       The partners had instructions on paper that they could consult at any time. They also had three tools on
their computer screen, two of which are included within DREW (1) (Corbel, Girardot, Jaillot, 2002; Corbel, et. al.,
2003). Figure 2 shows:
             1.  At the top left: a video of the origami folding task that the participants can play at their leisure.
                 The participants could fast forward, rewind or define a particular time stamp in order to get to any
                 part in the video.
             2.  At  the  right: a  shared text  editor (part  of DREW)     in which  the  participants   composed   their
                 procedural text for folding the origami hen. Both partners could write in the text editor, but not
                 simultaneously, due to single cursor. When one person writes, the other sees the text appear in real
                 time.
             3.  At the bottom left: a chat area with a personal text entry zone (also part of DREW). Pressing the
                 Enter key  sends    the typewritten  text to the shared  chat board, thus rendering   it visible to ones
                 partner.

Experimental protocol
       The pilot study took place in three stages. First, an experimenter explained the task to the participants and
described the tools they could use (5 min). Then, the participants were taken into the computer room. While they
carried out the task (1h), 3 experimenters observed their actions in order to characterize their activity and to pinpoint
any problems.   At the end  of   the experiment,   an experimenter    interviewed each  dyad  in   order  to gather  their
impressions and to identify any difficulties linked to the resources or the experimental protocol (10-15 min).

Corpus
       The participants' computer-mediated interaction via the DREW platform (chat and text editor) was traced
and converted from XML into ExcelTM format. The chat messages were saved each time the Enter key was pressed

after a message was typed. In regards to the text editor, a first level of granularity saved the totality of the text,
approximately every second. This was difficult to analyze (cf. Figure 3). A second level of granularity was thus
created (Dyke, 2006). Rather than send the entire contents of the text editor to the server, only the modified line
(which was given a number) and its state before the modification were saved (cf. Figure 4). A line of text is sent to
the server  in three  cases: 1) when  there   is no  activity  in the  text editor for  more    than 5 seconds    (=  production:
timeout), 2)   when  the participant changes     to the chat   (= production:    speaker changed     module)  or   3) when     ones
partner starts composing in the text editor at the same time (= production: speaker was interrupted).

Analyses: two-dimensional coding method
          A  two-dimensional    coding    method  was   elaborated    using the  chat interventions    of the pilot   study as    an
initial corpus. We first determined the pragmatic orientation of the utterance as primarily focusing on one of four
categories: the product (the written instructions for the origami hen), social aspects of discourse, the carrying out of
the task and the activity (cf. Table 2 for explanations of categories and examples). We then coded each utterance
according to the speech act (cf. Austin, 1962) that was used: proposition, acceptance, refusal, correction, directive,
affirmative, question & response (cf. Table 3). This allowed us to determine the cooperation as a function of the
utterance's value.

Social         Utterances that have the function of conveying emotions and thoughts of             "shall we say until our next

               directly concern the task.
Carrying out   The utterances that concern carrying out the task refer to the manner of            "how do you want to do this,

Activity       Utterances concerning "activity" are used in order to discuss what one or one's     "i'm looking at the video"
               partner is doing or has done.

Directive      Not give the choice to one's partner to either refuse or                         "erase it if you don't like it and write something in its

               obligate one's partner to carry out an action.

Determining the form of cooperation
          In order to determine the form of cooperation for the different dyads, we used Baker's model of (2002),
validated for pedagogical situations of cooperative problem resolution. As our situation was of another nature -- a
design task -- we had to find a way to apply this model in our own context. We needed to find a way to characterize
the three dimensions used to define forms of cooperation. Symmetry was defined according to two indicators relating
to text writing, the principal task: 1) the comparison of the number of interventions in the "textboard" between the
participants tells us whether the text writing is equitable; 2) the chat interventions of each participant concerning the
text writing also allows us distinguish the transactional role of "proposer" (i.e. does one partner suggest more text
proposals?). (Non)-alignment was illustrated by the (presence) absence of phrases of the type "i am lost". Granted,
the absence of such phrases does not guarantee alignment: partners could agree to work on different parts of the
problem.   Also, partners             could        be aligned,            but not   have  attained a common     understanding     of their  work.  The
observation grid was also an indicator of alignment: certain partners watched the same part of the video clip at the
same   time and  could             thus orient       their talk           about it. Finally, agreement     was decided   by coding   speech  acts:      the
presence of corrections and refusals determined whether or not the dyad was generally in agreement.

Results
          Two of the three dyads were in complete opposition. One of them was in "co-construction": symmetrical
(with equal roles), aligned (shared understanding) and in agreement (cf. Figure 5). The other dyad was in "apparent
one-sided argumentation": asymmetrical (different roles for each), non-aligned (e.g. lack of shared comprehension)
and in disagreement (presence of corrections or refusal of other's utterances) (cf. Figure 6).

Observations and hypotheses
        Different observations were made by relating the forms of cooperation used by the dyads and the function
of their utterances (cf. Figure 7). We can clearly see that the dyad in co-construction (symmetrical, aligned and in
agreement) shows                              a higher  proportion    of socially       oriented       utterances.   The correlation       of the    quantity of  socially
oriented utterances with good symmetry is thus the first hypothesis we sought to test. In a similar vein, we observe a
higher proposition of utterances concerning carrying out the task for the dyad in construction. Our second hypothesis
proposes that this type of utterances is also correlated with good symmetry.
        The dyad in apparent one-sided argumentation shows a larger quantity of utterances in regards to activity
than the other two dyads. This could indicate that the two actors are trying to align themselves by telling each other
what they are doing in order that they may synchronize. Our third hypothesis is thus that the quantity of utterances
concerning activity will be correlated to a poor alignment.

Principal experiment
        In    order                          to  illustrate    the differences      with  the     pilot   study,    we   present in the       following      sections, the
participants, the                            material they    used, the task,      the experimental       protocol,    the corpus,  the     analyses      carried out, the
results concerning the verification of our hypotheses and finally, our interpretations.

Participants, material, task and experimental protocol
        Ten   dyads                             (twenty students    aged         20-30 years)    participated in     the experiment.       They      were  non-experts  in
origami, regularly used chat and knew how to type on a keyboard.

                                                                                                 471                                                             CSCL 2007
                     Number of interventions
          The material underwent a number of changes from the pilot study. The paper hen was replaced by a paper
box, easier to fold in general and with less variation in difficulty. The text editor was also modified in order to allow
the two participants to write simultaneously; two cursors instead of one were available. During the pilot study, the
presence of one cursor created conflicts that reduced the usage of the text editor to one person at a time. Having two
cursors available could favor a more symmetrical cooperation as both partners can write simultaneously (cf. Dyke,
2006). Otherwise, the platform DREW remained identical with the chat and the text editor as well as the video.

          Some other modifications were made as a result of problems encountered during the pilot study. After the
initial introduction (5min), we added a presentation of the tools and their functions (5min). In addition, a conception
micro-task was inserted immediately before the task in order to familiarize the participants with the tools they were
to use (10min).   The questions  were given   in questionnaire  format   in order   to avoid influence  on the  part  of the
experimenter, but also to obtain information that a participant may not want to divulge in front of his or her partner.
(5min). Finally, an individual interview was also conducted (2min).

Corpus, analyses and results
          The ten interactions of the ten dyads were automatically recorded by DREW (chat + text editor) and were
transformed from XML into ExcelTM format (as for the pilot study).

          The same coding scheme used in the pilot study was applied to the corpus (on the chat interventions). Then,
inter-coder reliability was performed on six of the ten dyadic interactions. Three different coders coded respectively
three, two and one of the six interactions, depending on the time they had available. A comparison of these results
was done (cf. Table 4) in relation to the original coder, who coded all ten interactions.    The average of agreement of
the three  coders in relation to the original coder  was   77.24%    for functions  and  71,18%   for  speech   acts. As the
percentage  to be obtained in  order  for a coding   scheme  to   be reliable is 70%,   the  coding  of both  the utterance
function and the speech acts is validated (De Wever, Schellens, Valcke & Van Keer, 2006).

          As for the pilot study, and using the same indicators, we were able to identify many forms of cooperation:
three dyads in "apparent co-argumentation" (symmetrical, non-aligned, in disagreement), four dyads in "apparent
one-sided   argumentation"    (asymmetrical,   non-aligned,    in  disagreement),      two  dyads   in  "co-argumentation
(symmetrical,  aligned, in disagreement)    and  one dyad  in  "one-sided   argumentation"    (asymmetrical,    aligned,  in
disagreement).  The   graphs  below   show  (a)symmetry    and    (dis)agreement    and  illustrate two   examples    of the
differences between a symmetrical and a asymmetrical dyad. (cf. Figure 8 and Figure 9).

                                           Figure 9. Example of a dyad in apparent co-argumentation (symmetrical)

            Once the forms of cooperation were determined, we calculated 1) the average percentage of the utterances
concerning activity according to whether the dyad was aligned or not and 2) the average percentage of the utterances
concerning carrying out the task on the one hand and socially oriented utterances on the other according to whether
the dyad was symmetrical or not. (cf.                                             Figure 10). In order to ascertain whether the differences between groups were
significant, we performed the non-parametric Wilcoxon test, considered to be the equivalent of the t-test.

            Firstly, the quantity of socially oriented utterances is twice as large within the interactions of symmetrical
dyads     than for asymmetrical                   dyads.                          The Wilcoxon             test         shows           that         this difference            is          significant        and      that the                   two
groups are different (Ws=16, p=0.01). Secondly, the quantity of utterances concerning activity is almost twice as
large     within the     interactions              of       non-aligned                        dyads       than           for          aligned        dyads.   The          Wilcoxon                      test     shows     that                  this
difference is significant and that the two groups are different (Ws=7, p=0.025). Finally, the quantity of utterances
concerning carrying out the task did not differ according to dyad symmetry. According to the Wilcoxon test, the two
groups are identical (Ws=28, p>0.1).

Interpretations
        Contrary to the data from the pilot study, no dyad was in agreement. We notice much more argumentation
on the content of the instructions the students wrote. Perhaps the presence of two cursors in the text editor allowed
participants to write what     they  wanted without    first expressing    themselves  in   the chat  module  and  this created
disagreement.   The presence   of   one cursor obligates    the  two participants   to reflect  together on the   content of  the
instructions before writing them. Viewing a larger number of dyads allowed us to see that being aligned at a distance
is rather rare (seven dyads out of ten are not aligned) Not perceiving certain actions of ones partner and not being
able to establish eye-contact with him or her does not help in synchronizing reflections and actions.

        In regards to the link between (a)symmetry and the quantity of socially oriented utterances (1st hypothesis),
it is possible that maintaining good social rapport with ones partner allows for a relation of equality that translates
into equitable transactional roles, assuming similar socio-institutional roles. The interactions of symmetrical dyads
contain a higher quantity of socially oriented utterances than the interactions of asymmetrical dyads.

        However,    whatever    the  form of  cooperation,    it seems  necessary   that  dyads   exchange  utterances  dealing
with carrying   out the  task. Our   2nd hypothesis    is thus   not confirmed.   There   is no  link   between   symmetry   and
utterances   about  task. At   first glance,   this is  contrary   to   the  research   of  Lahti, Seitamaa-Hakkarainen       &
Hakkarainen,    (2001).   They  have    found  differences    in   the  proportion  of   the   interaction  consecrated   to  the
organization of a design task according to group. Indeed, it seems that groups that "collaborate" discuss in greater
length the   organization   of their design   than  the   groups   that "cooperate"    or   simply "coordinate".   Their   work
environment has more modules that allow for more of a difference in task organization according to group. Certain
modules are more pertinent than others in carrying out the task and this leads to choosing amongst them. On the
other hand, our own participants only had to organize the use of the textboard and this module is inherent to the
writing of the instructions and thus must necessarily be managed.

        The link between (non)-alignment and the quantity of utterances concerning activity shows that the lack of
information  emanating    from  ones  partner  concerning    his  or   her activity is compensated    for  by transmitting   this
information in writing (chat messages). This was our 3rd hypothesis. When partners are not aligned, it seems they
seek to synchronize themselves by expressing what they are doing or by asking what their partner is doing. This is
shown by the higher quantity of utterances concerning the activity than partners who are aligned.

Conclusions and perspectives
        Our work has enlarged the field of applicability of Baker's model (2002); we have shown it is possible to
apply this model with success to computer-mediated interactions whose objective is the design of a procedural text
(instructions for origami folding). We have also established a correlation between certain dimensions of this model
and three factors internal to dyadic interaction. Firstly, there is a greater quantity of socially oriented utterances in
symmetrical    interactions than  in  asymmetrical   interactions.     Secondly,  there  is  a  greater  quantity of utterances
dealing with activity (e.g. i'm looking at the video) in non-aligned interactions than in aligned interactions. Thirdly,
whatever   the cooperation   type,  and considering    that  all dyads  were   in disagreement,    there is a high   quantity of
utterances that deal with carrying out the task.

        In these two studies (pilot and principal), only the chat messages were analyzed for content. In the near
future, we would like to analyze the contributions made to the text editor from two angles: the type of contribution
(new production, correction, etc.) and the participant who contributed. This would allow us to refine the notion of
symmetry in relation to the whole task. It would also be interesting to relate these observations to the quality of the
product in order to appreciate which form of cooperation is optimal.
