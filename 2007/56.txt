          Abstract: Although in general collaborative learning is effective, it is clear that this is not
          always  the   case. To  explain  this, researchers     have   been suggested   to  investigate  the
          interaction process  occurring   in the   course    of collaboration.  Research    on   face-to-face
          (FTF)  groups  have   provided   clues  as   to what   types   of interaction  are  productive   for
          learning, both  at  the individual  and   group   level. However,     the extent   to  which  these
          findings  apply  to  online   groups   is not   yet    clear. This  paper   reports   a  conceptual
          systematic review of recent studies of online synchronous learning groups. There is little
          evidence  that the   types of   online interaction  deemed     favorable  are actually   associated
          with individual  conceptual     learning. These   findings    challenge  the  implicit   assumption
          held by   many  educational     technology   designers.  Implications     for future  research  are
          discussed.

Introduction
Two heads, more often than not, are better than one. This commonsense wisdom apparently applies also to
learning: learning   in groups  is generally  more   effective    than  alone  (Cohen,   1994;    Johnson  &   Johnson,
2004).  However,    research   has   also found   that collaboration     does  not  always   lead   to better  learning
outcomes (for a recent metaanalysis, see Springer, Stanne, & Donovan, 1999). To explain this, researchers
have been suggested to look into the collaboration process (Dillenbourg, Baker, Blayc, & O'Malley, 1995).
Indeed, studies have found that certain forms of interaction process are linked to learning. For example,
giving  explanations    during peer-directed  mathematics        study  groups has  been  found    to  be related  with
subsequent  individual   achievement    (Webb,    1982,   1991).  Similarly,   interpretive  talk, but not  descriptive
talk, between dyads working to solve a programming problem has been found to be related with group
performance and individual understanding (Teasley, 1995).

These and other findings (Barron, 2000a, 2000b, 2003; Chan, 2001; Chan, Burtin, & Bereiter, 1997; Kneser
& Ploetzner, 2001; Oshima, Scardamalia, & Bereiter, 1996) demonstrate that certain forms of interaction
are associated with individual learning and group performance. However, most of these findings come from
studies of face-to-face (FTF) groups. Will the same links be found in online synchronous learning groups?
What forms of interaction are associated with individual learning and group performance of online groups?
These questions are important because many online learning environment and cognitive tools are designed
with an eye to facilitating certain forms of interaction, which are assumed to bear learning benefits.

But why should we suspect that interaction of online groups would be any different from FTF groups? We
know that different media have different constraints and affordances for communication. Online, text-based
communication     affords  more    persistence   of  information,       meaning  that   previous   utterances  do   not
"evaporate" immediately, as they are recorded in the chat environment. On the other hand, it is limited in
terms of emotional expressions, deictic gestures, spontaneous response, and eye gaze, which are subtle but
important  in  achieving   "common      ground"     (Clark &     Brennan,   1991).  Because     of  these  differences,
achieving a grounding criterion sufficient for learning to occur would entail a different process for online
and FTF groups.

Furthermore,   detailed  analysis  of  groups    solving  complex      conceptual   problems   shows   that successful
collaboration is based on the co-construction of a joint problem space (Roschelle, 1995). More recently,
another study   has   proposed    that collaboration   involves   two    spaces:  a content   space    (which  is more
cognitive and associated with the problem to be solved), and a relational space (which more to do with
affective and social aspects of interaction, such as identity and conflict) (Barron, 2003, p. 310). For groups
to maintain a joint attention that is productive for individual learning and group performance, these two
spaces must be coordinated well. How this complex coordination is achieved, once again, would differ with

                                                           56                                                     CSCL 2007
regards  to the medium     of communication.   Thus,   it is        quite reasonable   to examine   how  interaction       and
learning links specifically in computer-mediated groups.

Objectives, scope, and approach
This review will focus on studies of online, synchronous learning groups, and thus will extend previous
reviews  of  FTF  collaborative  or  cooperative   learning           (Cohen, 1994;   Webb,   1982, 1991).  Unlike        most
previous  reviews,  however,   the purpose    here is not          to assess  the effectiveness  of online  collaboration.
Instead, this review   seeks  to examine   what    kinds  of          online interaction  processes  are associated       with
learning outcomes, both at the individual and group level (group problem solving performance). This was
done by systematically searching empirical reports from nine representative journals relevant to the current
purpose1. In addition, articles from the 2005 CSCL Conference were also systematically searched.                          The
search used several combinations of keywords ("interaction", "collaborative learning", and "computer").

The retrieved articles were then selected based on the following criteria: published recently (from 2000
until mid-2006), report data on both interaction processes and learning outcomes, and investigated online
groups communicating synchronously. These limitations excluded many articles that report interaction data
but not learning outcome (and vice versa), and studies of groups collaborating asynchronously (e.g., using
emails or wikis). This review is admittedly selective and not comprehensive, as the aim is more towards
finding  conceptual   insights  than summarizing      empirical         results   (as in meta-analyses).   However,        the
aforementioned criteria were used to limit possible bias or subjectivity on the inclusion of studies from the
search.

Description of studies
The selection process resulted in 12 articles, covering 606 groups (1161 individuals). From these studies,
14  separate  results can  be examined   (one article reported          2 experiments,    and another  article reported      2
different measures of individual learning). A brief description of these studies is given below:

Participants and tasks
Participants were school-aged or university students who worked in pairs or groups of three (triads). The
collaboration was relatively short-term, with most studies (9 of 12) using single-session meetings of 40 to
120 minutes. The remaining studies used multiple sessions of 3 to 6 meetings. All but one study used tasks
that were   domain-related,   such   as tasks in   physics         (fluid dynamics),     biology (heredity, food         chain),
psychology (clinical case study and attribution theory), and historical inquiry. One exception, which is a
more general problem solving task, was solving a murder case. Some tasks were ill-structured (e.g., writing
argumentative essays and constructing a clinical diagnosis), while others are somewhat more constraining
(e.g., constructing a concept map using a set of given concepts, or answering multiple choice questions).

Types of learning scaffold
All  but one  study   used scaffolds that were  built into          the software  environment    as cognitive  tools.     One
exception is Saab, van Joolingen, & van Hout-Wolters' (2006) study, which used a collaboration script (the
RIDE rule) delivered as an instruction prior to the interaction. The rest of the studies used cognitive tools,
which can be categorized into script-prompts and external representation tools. Scripts are prompts built
into the learning environment that facilitate certain actions, be it epistemic acts (e.g., finding data to ground
certain claims) or social acts (e.g., taking a certain role in the interaction). External representation tools
vary in their degree of constraint, ranging from very generic and "loose" (such as a virtual whiteboard) to
more constraining (such as concept maps and dynamic models).

Approaches to coding interaction data
The coding used by most of the studies reviewed here can be categorized into three approaches. The first,
simplest way of "coding" interaction is merely counting the number of utterance or message, disregarding
the content or meaning of the message. The second approach differentiates the content of single utterances

1 These are Computers and Education, Computers in Human Behavior, Cognition and Instruction, Educational Technology Research
and Development, Instructional Science, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, Journal of Educational Computer Research,
Learning and Instruction, and The Journal of the Learning Sciences

                                                        57                                                                CSCL 2007
using  a  certain categorization.      One  example      is Chiu's     (2004)  coding,  which counted      the  number   of
"knowledge-related" utterances produced by learners during a collaborative concept mapping session. A
rather more refined example is the coding of "task acts" in van Drie, van Boxter, Jaspers, & Kanselaar's
(2005) study, which categorized utterances as on-task, procedural, technical, social talk, or greetings. The
third approach parses interaction data at the episode level, which is a series of single moves or utterances.
Included in this approach is van Drie et al.'s (2005) coding of episodes into domain-specific reasoning,
elaborated reasoning, and co-constructed reasoning. It should be noted that these coding approaches were
sometimes used in combination by one study. One study (Dillenbourg & Traum, 2006) used a somewhat
different approach.       Rather than  analyzing utterances       and  episodes,  Dillenbourg  and     Traum   looked   into
degree   of grounding      (see  Clark  &  Brennan,      1991),    as  indicated  by how  often   participants   explicitly
acknowledge that they have understood their partner's move. To summarize, we can differentiate between
coding of interaction at the individual/solo action level (single utterances) as opposed to coding at the joint
action level (episodes of utterances and degree of grounding).

Assessment of learning outcome
Learning can be assessed at the individual and group level. Assessment of individual learning included
declarative  knowledge,      problem-solving    transfer,    and    reproduction  of  group  problem-solving      behavior
(e.g., constructing a     concept    map  using the     same   set  of  concept  and  relations). With   regard  to  group
performance,    we  can      distinguish   between       assessment     of  problem   representation    produced    during
collaboration  (such      as concept   map  or  dynamic      model)     and   problem   solution. The   problem   solution
category can be distinguished further into responses to structured tests and construction of artifacts (such as
essays).

Results
Results of this review will be discussed separately for learning outcomes measured at the individual level
and those measured at the group level (group performance in problem solving).

Interaction and individual learning

There seem to be little evidence that online interaction is actually related with individual learning outcomes
(see Table 1). Two studies of groups learning (Makitalo, Weinberger, Hakkinen, Jarvela, & Fischer, 2005;
Weinberger,   Ertl, Fischer,      &   Mandl,   2005)     found    that  producing    more  messages     or  words   during
interaction  was  not      associated  with  higher      ability  in  a near   transfer  posttest  (applying    conceptual
understanding of Weiner's attribution theory to a new case). Further unfavorable evidence comes from
Zumbach,    Schonemann,         and  Reimann   (2005),      who   investigated   dyads   communicating      via a chat   to
construct a clinical diagnosis of a psychological disorder patient. These authors analyzed the interaction
process  at the episodic     level,  looking at action-response        sequences  defined  as collaborative     events. No
correlation  was  found      between  the  frequency     of collaborative     events and individual    gain in  declarative
knowledge test on the topic (depression and anorexia-nervosa), or quality of the clinical diagnosis.

These results are somewhat unsurprising, as the study authors used only a measure of frequency. The first
two studies  (Makitalo       et al., 2005; Weinberger       et al.,   2005)   simply counted  the     number of  words   or
messages.   Zumbach,       Schonemann,     and  Reimann        (2005)   also  did not   differentiate   between   types  of
collaborative  events      (although  coded  interaction     at   the  episode   level) and  thus     lump  together short
sequences (e.g., simply agreeing to a proposal put forward the partner) with more elaborated sequences
(e.g., challenging a proposal and then elaborating reasons for a counter-proposal). However, it is important
to note that dyads in one of the experimental conditions did not engage in any collaborative event, but
nevertheless achieved high individual learning outcome. This means that collaborative interaction (whether
short or elaborated) as defined in this study does not necessary relate to quality of individual learning.

A further question is whether certain types of online interaction (for example, elaborated or knowledge
related episodes) are more associated with individual learning. Results from van Drie et al.'s (2005) study
of  dyads    performing      a  historical   inquiry    task  facilitated    by several     different representational        forms
(diagram, matrix, or list) can be used to address this question. In coding the interaction process, van Drie et
al. identified episodes when dyads engaged in elaborated explanations. However, although the matrix and
control groups produced more historical reasoning, co-construction, and co-elaboration episodes, they did
not  perform    better    in a  subsequent   individual      test on  historical   reasoning.    Similarly,    in studying     pairs
solving problems in a physics microworld, Saab, van Joolingen, and van Hout-Wolters (2006) found that
groups  who     engaged      in more    "communicative          activities",  "discovery    transformative     activities"     (e.g.,
describing and recognizing relations and drawing conclusions), and "regulative transformative activities"
did not perform better in declarative nor near-transfer knowledge tests.

Further unfavorable evidence comes from Weinberger et al. (2005), who studied triads communicating via
a  message     board      to analyze    cases  using     attribution    theory.    In this    study,  groups      provided     with
argumentation     scripts    produced   more   counter-arguments           and  twice  as   many   grounded       claims  in   their
messages. This indicates that these group members engaged in deeper cognitive processes related to the
learning material. Despite this, no differences were found in individual members' performance in analyzing
a  new case    using    attribution  theory.  However,       it is interesting    to note   the  groups   using   argumentation
scripts did outperform other groups in a posttest measuring ability to construct arguments. Thus it seems
that although    the    interaction  quality  has little   influence    on   domain   knowledge,      it does   have   a  positive
influence    on a more       general epistemic    skill  (constructing      arguments)    that   was  performed     or   practiced
during the collaboration.

Evidence of this last point can also be found in Chiu's (2004) study of 6th grade student triads constructing
concept maps of several domain-knowledge. Students who produced more knowledge-related utterances
during their collaboration had better ability to reconstruct the concept map (of the same set of concepts and
relations)   two  weeks      after  the experiment.        Again,     this is  evidence     that relevant   interaction       during
collaboration is related to an epistemic skill (which is, in this case, the epistemic skill of constructing a
semantic network) performed during the collaboration.

The only evidence that elaborating knowledge-related material during collaboration is related to acquisition
of  declarative   knowledge       comes  from   Weinberger         et al.'s  (2005)   study   of pairs   studying   a    theory  of
genotype environment effect. Communicating via a video conference channel, students who engaged in
more in theory elaborations also gained higher score on a cued-recall test. It is important to note that in this
study, the     context    was   a  peer-tutorial  interaction,       which    has  long been     known      to be  an    effective
pedagogical     approach.    Elaborations    within     this context   requires    more cognitive     processing,   as   they   are
performed explicitly or deliberately (explaining and elaborating is the group task).

In  summary,    although       certain types  of  interaction      do  relate   to   better ability   in performing      behavior
previously practiced in groups (constructing concept maps and arguments), there is little evidence that they
lead to improve declarative or conceptual knowledge. The only exception comes from a study that uses a
peer-tutorial scenario and video-conference (i.e. not chat-based).

                                                                  59                                                           CSCL 2007
Interaction and group performance

The studies reviewed provide some evidence for a link between interaction and learning at the group level
(measured by a group's performance to produce a solution to a problem, which can be an essay, concept
maps,  or  responses      to a set of  questions).     Some      of the studies   summarized      in  Table     2 use multiple
indicators   for group     learning   outcome       (e.g., essay    quality   can be   measured      from     its organization,
argumentation quality, and audience focus), and thus there can be "mixed" evidence in a single study. As
will be discussed, there are several interesting patterns of relationship, again depending on how we assess
learning.

In terms of group learning outcome, we can distinguish between performances in: (1) solving a general
logical problem (e.g. a murder case), (2) constructing a textual/linguistic artifact (e.g. argumentative essay),
(3) solving   a  structured    domain-specific      task   (e.g. physics     problem), and (4)    constructing     a  graphical
external representation (e.g. concept maps and dynamic models). Interestingly, certain types of interaction
have a positive effect on the latter two indicators of performance.

In Saab, van Joolingen, & van Houtwolters (2006), performance in solving physics problems is correlated
with hypothesis formulation, informative acts, proposing answers, and collecting data in the microworld.
Saab and van Joolingen's (2005) earlier study also found similar results. Moreover, these correlations were
at the moderate level (0.51 to 0.62). However, they were found only in the experimental groups (not in the
control groups), a point that will be returned to later.

Evidence that certain types of interaction influence the quality of graphical representations produced come
from three studies. Chiu, Huang, and Chang (2000) found high correlations between on-task interactions
with quality of concept map. Chiu's (2004) more recent study also lead to the finding that groups who
engaged in more knowledge-related talk also produced better concept maps. In a similar vein, Manlove,
Lazonder, and de Jong (2006) found that groups who produced more cognitive episodes in their interaction
also constructed better models of a water tank. The correlations between number of cognitive episodes and
quality of dynamic model were 0.39 (for experimental groups) and 0.64 (for control groups).

High-quality     interaction   (e.g.  elaboration)     does   not   seem     to relate much      to  group     performance    in
constructing essays (Erkens et al., 2005) or solving a murder mystery (Dillenbourg & Traum, 2006). Both
of these tasks are, in a sense, more ill-defined than previously considered tasks. Essay tasks have ill-defined
end states (more so than concept maps or dynamic models), whereas murder cases have ill-defined process.
However, Erkens did find several weak correlations between coordination processes during collaboration
and essay    quality.    van Drie  et al.  also  found     a correlation     between   co-elaborated    episodes    with    essay
quality (r=.66), but only for groups using matrix during their collaboration.

                                                               60                                                           CSCL 2007
Taken together, these results suggest that certain types of interaction are not directly related to problem
solving    performance.   They    are  more   related    intermediate   artifacts,    such   as  a   group's  graphical
representation of a problem or a group's efficiency in planning how to go about in an ill-structured task
(Dillenbourg & Traum, 2006). However, producing better external representation of a problem, or planning
more efficiently, does not guarantee a successful solution.

Discussion and implications
Many    CSCL   researchers   design  instructional  supports  to  structure  online   collaboration   with   the aim  to
facilitate certain  kinds   of interaction.   The   implicit assumption     is  that  certain   kinds (or  features)  of
interaction bear   learning  benefits. However,     the studies  reviewed   here   provide    limited support    for this
assumption. At the individual level, interactions that have been found to be beneficial in FTF groups (e.g.
elaborating explanations, co-constructing arguments, and generating grounded claims) do not seem to be
related with  increase   in declarative   knowledge   or ability  to solve  problems    by   applying   the  conceptual
knowledge    learnt during   collaboration. At  the  group   level, the picture    is rather  mixed.  Certain  types  of
utterance exchanges (episodes) seem to be related to group performance. However, this applies more for
intermediate indicators (such as quality of external representation of the problem), but less for end-product
indicators  (such   as   essays, which    are  not   representations  of    the problem,      but  an  end-product    of
collaboration). Although no conclusive explanations can be offered for these findings, we will try to discuss
possible   explanations  and   directions for further   research  by way    of  comparison     with  several  published
studies of FTF collaboration:

First, many studies of FTF learning groups have found that verbal interaction predicts individual learning
gains, even after controlling prior knowledge. Webb (1991), for example, reviewed studies of peer-directed
groups instructed to work with mathematical problems. One consistent finding is the positive correlations
(controlling for prior math ability) between the frequency of giving elaborated explanations and subsequent
individual test. This is in contrast to the relative independence between group processes and individual
learning   gains found   by  studies   of online  groups  reviewed    here.    One    possible  explanation   might   be
methodological. In most of the studies reviewed here, only one study (Zumbach, Schonemann, & Reimann,
2005) explicitly tested the correlation between measures of process and measures of individual learning
outcome. In other studies, this relationship must be inferred from looking at whether groups scoring higher
on certain types of interaction also performed better on individual learning. However, this is problematic
because these studies aggregated interaction process measures at the group level. For example, an elaborate
utterance from one member of a dyad would contribute not only to this particular member, but instead to
the dyad's  score   (the non-contributing   member      would  also  be given   a  score   based   on his/her partner's
contribution).   Thus,   one   direction  for future    research  would  be     to   obtain  measures     of  individual
contributions during online collaboration and relate these to individual learning outcomes.

Second, there are several indications that the common coding scheme used to analyze online interaction
failed to distinguish utterances reflecting different levels of cognitive activity. This is evident in at least two
studies (Saab, van Joolingen, & van Hout-wolters, 2006; van Drie et al., 2005). Saab et al. found that,
during  collaboration    in  a physics    microworld,    utterances  reflecting    giving   information,    formulating
hypothesis,  proposing   answers,   and   collecting data were    positively   correlated   (.51  to .61) with   groups'
problem-solving     performance.   However,    this  was  true   only   for the    experimental    groups    (who were
supported with a collaboration scaffold), but not for the control groups. Similarly, van Drie et al. found that
the number of co-elaborated episodes a group produced is correlated with its argumentative essay quality (r
= .66), but this applies only for groups using matrices when constructing their arguments. These indicate
that similarly coded utterance or episodes bear different learning consequences, meaning that the coding
scheme is somewhat limited in capturing the cognitive value underlying the observable interaction.

One possible explanation is that the "code and count" approach to analyzing group process used in the
reviewed studies cannot capture the more emergent properties of the joint discourse. For example, a code
and count approach cannot distinguish between two groups producing similar frequencies of a certain type
of utterance (elaborated explanation, for example), but embedded in different overall interaction patterns.
Several  studies of  FTF    groups  indicated  that  the overall  interaction   pattern  is  important.   For example,
Mercer   (1996)   noted   that groups     similarly engaged    in a  collaborative     task   can  have   disputational,
cumulative, or exploratory talk patterns (with the first pattern being the least productive for learning). More

                                                          61                                                       CSCL 2007
telling is Barron's (2003) finding from her study of triads collaborating to solve a complex mathematical
problem anchored in a video-based story. One of Barron's findings is that groups differed in performance
not because none of the members could generate correct solution to the problem. Performance difference
was more related to at which point in time during the conversation those correct solutions were proposed.
In successful groups, solutions were more frequently proposed in relation with the content of the preceding
discussion. This   can be   interpreted  as indicating the   importance of  sequential   structure of  collaborative
interactions, and call for a sequential approach in analyzing them.

Another way to capture the joint property of group discourse is to use Bereiter's (2002) distinction between
problem-centered and referent-centered approaches to knowledge. Using these concepts, we can distinguish
between groups who discuss new information as problems to be explained using concepts as tools, and
groups who engage in similar discussions but implicitly adopt the goal of accumulating knowledge (which
is assumed to reflect reality). Several studies of FTF groups have found that this distinction in how learners
approach knowledge corresponds to individual learning and group performance (Chan, 2001; Chan, Burtin,
& Bereiter, 1997; Oshima, Scardamalia, & Bereiter, 1996). Whether this distinction is useful for analyzing
online collaboration would be another direction for future work.

Third, in contrast to findings from FTF groups, none of the studies reviewed here provide evidence to link
interaction through    text-based    chat with    individual  mastery  of  declarative   knowledge.    A   tentative
conclusion  is that it is difficult  to engage  in deep   cognitive  processing  in text-based online  interaction,
especially during short-term collaboration among people who are new to each other. However, (as pointed
out by an anonymous reviewer) this will have to be investigated by comparing FTF and online groups using
identical materials and measurements. In addition, forms of online interaction do not appear to be related to
group performance    in   joint problem   solving. Groups    who  engage  in more   meaningful     discourse do not
necessarily perform    better.  One  possible   explanation  is that during  the collaborative  problem    solving,
groups who did not produce much meaningful discourse achieved similar performance by following their
most competent member. This is most evident in one study (Saab, van Joolingen, & van Hout-wolters,
2006), which found a strong correlation between communication asymmetry and group performance among
the control groups.

Fourth, there is evidence that text-based online interaction is related with other learning outcomes beside
declarative knowledge.    In Weinberger,     Fischer, and  Stegmann's   (2005)   study,  members    of groups  who
produced more grounded claims were better able to construct arguments, which is a valuable epistemic
practice. It would be interesting for future research to investigate whether online interaction could help
individuals learn other forms of epistemic practices. For example, researchers using concept maps could
assess whether participation in collaborative concept mapping helps to enhance an individual's ability to
extract core concepts from new texts, or to formulate better guiding questions when comprehending new
texts. This is arguably a more meaningful learning outcome than the ability to reproduce the same concept
maps  from  the same    set of  concepts,   as in Chiu's   (2004) study.  Furthermore,   assessment    of epistemic
practices widens the current focus on domain-knowledge mastery.
