         Abstract:   Collaborative      multimedia    learning   is a   complex   and   demanding     scenario.
         Differently coded representations, interactive components, and communication have to be
         managed and processed simultaneously. Focusing learners' attention to relevant information
         might help to reduce complexity. This study was designed to investigate whether collaborative
         learning with multimedia can be improved by information cueing, i.e. highlighting essential
         information in differently coded learning material, and by providing relevant causal relations
         in interactive learning material. Learning dyads were compared in four experimental groups
         which differed with regard to information cueing during two subsequent collaboration phases.
         Learning material comprised multiple static representations (phase 1) and the possibility to
         manipulate these representations interactively (phase 2). Preliminary results (N = 24) indicate
         that cueing relevant information during collaboration focuses learners' attention to essential
         aspects, helps to structure their learning discourse, and improves learning outcome.

Introduction
Collaborative  multimedia    learning   is  challenging   in  many    ways.  Learners   have to   identify  thematically
important rather than perceptually relevant information, to interrelate and mentally integrate multiple external
representations (MER), to select and systematically manipulate adequate variables in dynamic and interactive
visualizations  (DIV),  to  structure   collaboration   in  a  goal-oriented  way,  and   to manage     all  these  tasks
simultaneously  in the  realms    of their  limited   working   memories    (Bodemer,   Kapur,    Molinari, Rummel,   &
Weinberger, 2011; Vahey, Enyedy, & Gifford, 2000).
         Research suggested various methods for supporting learners in dealing with these different challenges.
For instance, in order to enable learners to take advantage of the potential of differently represented information,
supporting  translation   processes  between    representations     has  been shown    to be   beneficial   (e.g. linking
representations or   providing    an  interactive    integration  task). With   regard   to  dynamic   and     interactive
visualizations supporting   hypothesis     testing (e.g., providing   pre-defined  hypotheses)    or constructing   basic
representational knowledge with different static representations prior to learning with DIV showed to reduce
workload   and   led   to  better  learning.    Regarding     collaborative   learning  processes,   providing     shared
representations showed to facilitate grounding processes and proved to support the identification of conflicting
knowledge or opinions (Bodemer, 2011).
         An instructional suggestion that is relevant for MER, DIV, and collaboration scenarios is to focus
learners to  relevant   information     of the  learning   material:    (1)  By pre-structuring   content   in    different
representations, e.g. via advanced organizers (Gurlitt, Dummel, Schuster, & Nückles, 2012) or by highlighting
relevant information (signaling; Mautone & Mayer, 2001), and (2) by visually cueing important causalities in
conceptual simulations (de Koning, Tabbers, Rikers, & Paas, 2007). (3) In collaborative settings, either applying
shared external  representations,    that  implicitly focus   the learning   partners' activities to the  most    relevant
information (representational guidance; Suthers & Hundhausen, 2003) or providing cognitive group awareness-
tools, that gather and visualize knowledge-related information about learning partners (Bodemer & Dehler,
2011) proved to guide learners' attention to relevant aspects.
         The presented study is starting point of a series of three studies intended to integrate these different
research fields and to systematically analyze three underlying mechanisms of cognitive group awareness-tools.
This first study examines the effect of focusing learners' attention to essential information in MER-based and
DIV-based CSCL. It is investigated if cueing essential information by highlighting relevant elements during
MER-based     collaboration  and     by   providing   essential  relations  during  DIV-based     collaboration   creates
affordances for focused search, communication and elaboration processes. It is assumed that information cueing
(HA) focuses the learning partners' attention to the most relevant information, (HB) leads to more systematic
interaction and communication behaviour, and (HC) enhances learning outcome.

Experimental Study
In this study two learning partners were provided with interdependent learning material (pictorial vs. algebraic;
15 min).  Afterwards    they were    instructed  to   collaboratively elaborate  on statistics concepts     by means  of
different multimedia learning material in two subsequent phases: (1) During a MER-based collaboration phase
(15 min) learners were provided with material that contained formulas and a static visualization of the analysis
of variance. To  focus  learners' attention   in   a meaningful   way,   the most  relevant  visual  and  formula-based

components were highlighted visually in terms of color in two of four experimental groups (MER+/DIV+ and
MER+/DIV-). (2) During a DIV-based collaboration phase (20 min) the visualization was augmented by several
interactive components, e.g. dragging a group mean to increase or decrease it. Again, in two experimental
groups (MER-/DIV+   and   MER+/DIV+)    information   cues                                                                                            were  provided by  presenting the essential causal
relations between variables (cf. Figure 1). Both collaboration phases were conducted using a multi-touch table,
enabling face-to-face communication between learning partners.
        This presentation reports preliminary analyses based on a subset of 24 university students (12 females
and 12 males), aged 19-30 years (M = 21.83, SD = 2.35). Dyads of participants were randomly assigned to the
four experimental groups.

Results and Discussion
Due to  the preliminary nature of  the data, all  results                                                                                           are described with a more  qualitative focus. After
completing full-scale data acquisition, quantitative and more comprehensive analyses will be presented.
        (HA) To investigate the assumption that information cueing helps learning partners to focus on germane
aspects, the number of essential concepts identified and discussed by the learning partners was assessed. It
revealed that learners addressed more relevant information if they were supported by information cueing both
during MER-based collaboration (MMER+ = .73 vs. MMER- = .52) and DIV-based collaboration (MDIV+ = .70 vs.
MDIV- = .21). Additional  analyses indicate  that learners                                                                                           who  were provided  with information  on essential

relations generated and   tested   more goal-oriented   hypotheses during   DIV-collaboration  (MDIV+ = 9.00  vs.
MDIV- = 5.50).
          (HB) First analyses of the learning discourses indicate that learning dyads differ in structuring their
collaboration and communication depending on whether they have been supported by information cueing or not.
During both collaboration phases, providing information cues led to more systematic and effective learning
discourses. In the following, examples of characteristic MER-based collaboration processes with highlighted or
non-highlighted learning material are given in order to illustrate the influence of information cueing on the
learning discourse (cf. Figure 2).

  Figure 2. Characteristic MER-based collaboration sequences with (a) highlighted, and (b) non-highlighted
  material; numbers indicate the sequence of discussion (dashed circles indicate non-essential information).

          (a) Learning partners in Figure 2a were provided with material that comprised highlighted cues to
essential information. Learners    showed a  very  good  interrelation of algebraic and  pictorial elements. The
sequence of their collaborative learning process was well structured: at the beginning, learners discussed the
critical F-value and established references between the two different representations (1-2). They continued with
this systematic approach regarding all aspects of ANOVA: basic elements (4-9; measurement, group mean etc.),
further crucial concepts like error and treatment effect (10-17) and, finally, different aspects of variance and
their meaning for significance of results (18-20).
          (b) The learning dyad in Figure 2b was provided with non-highlighted learning material. Concerning
different representations, there was very little integration of algebraic and pictorial learning material. Learners
exclusively explored and discussed the visualization of the ANOVA during the first half of the collaboration
(1-17), before they even started to establish references between formulas and visual components (18-33). This
indicates that without information cueing learners' attention is guided by other representational properties, i.e.
reading direction and representational affordances of the visualization. Regarding content this dyad showed a
rather linear approach at first: they clarified the more basic elements (1-7), and then discussed more complex
concepts  consecutively (8-17).    Afterwards, learners started to integrate formulas   and visual elements  but,
thereby, showed no systematic approach (18-33).

          (HC) Individual  learning was   measured  in   three knowledge    tests which  had to be   performed   prior
(knowledge test 1) and subsequent to the collaboration phases (knowledge tests 2 and 3) (cf. Table 1 for means
and standard deviations). On a descriptive level it showed that, as expected, test scores increased if learners
were provided with information cues. Results regarding two subtests appear to be especially interesting: cueing
information during the MER-based collaboration substantially increased test scores in representational transfer
test items, whereas providing information cues during the DIV-based collaboration led to better performances
on items, which were designed to quantify intuitive knowledge.

          Overall, these   preliminary  results indicate that  information    cueing focuses  learners'  attention to
essential aspects  of multimedia   learning material  with MER    and    with DIV.   Learning  dyads  provided   with
information cues interacted with each other and with the learning material in a systematic and beneficial way:
they successfully integrated differently coded representations as well as different aspects of their knowledge.
Without   information   cues, learners' attention  was   guided  more    by representational  properties  which    are
perceptually relevant (cf. Suthers & Hundhausen, 2003) and less by thematically important information.
          Results  of this study indicate that  focusing  learners' attention  to  relevant  information  of learning
material can reduce complexity and support collaborative learning with different types of multimedia material.
Furthermore, these results might partially explain promising effects of cognitive group awareness-tools that
provide social information based on essential aspects of the learning material (e.g. Bodemer, 2011).
          More  comprehensive    analyses   based  on  complete   data will   give  further  insight into interaction
processes,  differences    between  MER-    and   DIV-based    learning, and   potential  transfer   effects between
collaboration phases.
