        Abstract:   This   study   explored the   impact   of online     collaborative learning    on  students'
        understanding of the nature of scientific theory. The participants consist of 52 college students
        who attended a course titled "Introduction to Nature Science". Data sources came from (1) a
        pre-post survey that assesses students' understanding of the nature of scientific theory, and (2)
        students'  online  interactions. Findings   indicate  that    after engaging   in online   collaborative
        learning for a semester, students demonstrated a more informed understanding of the nature of
        scientific theory.

Introduction
We  are entering  into a  technology-rich   and  knowledge-based       age,   in which  education   is expected  to  help
learners develop more creative and adaptive skills. Gloor (2006) mentioned that many creative endeavors are
not personal achievements, but the result of collaborative knowledge construction. Against such a background,
how teachers can help foster students' capacity for more collaborative learning becomes an important learning
challenge.  To this end, in this study, we employ "knowledge building pedagogy" as an instructional approach
(Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006), to transform students' learning experiences in a course that aimed to improve
students' understanding of nature of scientific theory.

Literature review

Nature of science
Studies have pointed out that helping students enhance their understanding of the nature of scientific theory is
important. In general, there are two views of nature of scientific theory. Table 1 shows some different, selected
features between the traditional and modern views of nature of scientific theory.

Knowledge building
In this research, we use knowledge building pedagogy instead of textbook-based instruction to facilitate students
to engage in reasoning about, understanding of, and improving scientific theories. Knowledge building is very
different from traditional knowledge-telling pedagogy. Knowledge building practice focuses on improving ideas
and collective  knowledge   in a community,      capitalizing on   collective  responsibility  for sustained knowledge
construction, and  for fostering   self-directed learning.  Moreover,     knowledge    building  fosters a collaborative
learning environment for students to freely discuss scientific theories. This is to help foster their abilities of
collective problem-solving and knowledge construction

Method
Participants were 52 students who attended a course titled "Introduction to Nature Science". The course lasted
for one semester (18 weeks). Instructional design was based on knowledge building pedagogy, with Knowledge
ForumTM    (KF)  being used to  complement    student  work      with ideas   and knowledge.   All   students' ideas and
discussion  were  recorded  in   KF.   Data mainly    came    from    (1)   a pre-post survey   that  assesses  students'

understanding of the nature of scientific theory, and (2) students' online interactions. The questionnaire contains
five open-ended questions as follows: (1) What is a scientific theory? (2) Is there a "better" or "worse" scientific
theory? Why? (3) How does a scientific theory form? (4) Is a scientific theory invented or discovered? Why? (5)
Why do we need science theory? The survey data were analyzed based on a coding scheme emerged during the
coding process (see Table 2). Pair-sample t-test was performed to examine whether there were any significant
differences between the pre- and post-test. As this was just a preliminary analysis, only analysis of pre-post
survey was reported.

Result
Table 2 shows the overall results. It was found that after engaging in collaborative learning and knowledge
building for a semester,  the participating students' understanding   of nature  of scientific theory significantly
changed in a more constructivist sense from pre-test to post-test (t=-5.08, p<.01). For example, there was a
significant increase in understanding the origin of scientific theory from a more subjective, intrepretivist way
(t=-4.49, p<.01). Moreover, students also tended to see scientific theory as invented rather than discovered (t=-
4.49, p<.01; t=-4.59, p<.01). In brief, after a semester, students demonstrated a more informed understanding of
the nature of scientific theory.

Conclusion
In summary, the findings indicate that students changed their understanding regarding the nature of scientific
theory after the study. In the beginning of the semester, students thought that theories were discovered and they
regarded theory as a "truth" that cannot be changed. Also, students considered scientific theory as only objective
explanation of phenomena in the world. However, after the semester, students thought that theories could be
subjectively changed    and improved   and  also was  likely to   be invented    though personal  imagination and
collaborative innovation. In addition, students thought that theories not only can help explain the world but can
help improve living technologies and human life. In conclusion, after engaging in collaborative learning for a
semester, students' understanding of the nature of scientific theory changed from a more traditional view to a
more constructivist-interpretivist way. In future research, we will focus on "how" students changed, and further
analyze their collaborative learning process during this course.
