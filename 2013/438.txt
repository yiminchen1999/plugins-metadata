         Abstract:   In   the  method  of  preparation  for  future learning,   learners   often engage   in
         constructive interaction with expressing, listening to and integrating their own multiple voices.
         In order to identify a specific discourse structure underlying successful collaboration, we used
         a remotely controllable robot as a member of a small discussion group of college students who
         solved a challenging physics problem. For the robot to act as a listener who solicits voices
         from students in the group, we manipulated its ways of "revoicing": it performed minimum
         revoicing of students' keywords without evaluative comments in one condition and guiding
         revoicing towards scientific models in the other condition. Comparing these two conditions in
         addition to a human-only condition, we found that the robot's minimum revoicing fostered
         students' agency and reflection on their mental models, which prepared them to learn from a
         lecture and solve a transfer problem. The role of listener for PFL was discussed.

Introduction
In this paper, we examine if there is a specific structure of discourse, i.e., multi-vocal structure, in successful
collaborative learning using a remotely operate-able robot. In successful classrooms, learners often expand their
understanding adaptively by revising their folk knowledge into scientific understandings. This process often
requires collaborative  forms   in which   learners express their  own  multiple  thoughts  (voices), exchange   and
integrate them in constructive interaction (Miyake, 1986; Shirouzu, Miyake & Masukawa, 2002). As one of
forms, we use the learning method of preparation for future learning (PFL) (Schwartz & Martin, 2004) or
productive failure (Kapur & Bielaczyc, 2012) because it is now widely practiced and yields positive results in
classrooms. With this method, researchers set up a small-group "groping" activity (e.g., ill-defined problem-
solving) prior to a lecture or whole-class discussion, and examine how such an activity prepares students for
future learning from instructional resources. Their analyses indicated that the groping fosters students' epistemic
agency and drives their extensive search in the problem space. They also implied that constructive interaction
took place there. We can identify constructive interaction in Schwartz and Martin's conversation excerpt of
ninth graders who tried to invent a measure of reliability for pitching machines. One student first proposed a
solution, and the other two students monitored it, commenting on its limitations and flaws, which triggered the
first one's reflection. In this way, they took turns acting as task-doer (talker) and monitor (listener), leading to
the constructive proposal of newer and more general solutions, even if they did not reach canonical ones. In
order to trigger such interaction rather than waiting for it to occur, we could put a listener into a group because
the listener solicits others' active explanations and makes comments that foster talkers' reflection on their ideas.
         Why do we try to put a listener instead of a leader who facilitates and demonstrates how to collaborate?
It is because we believe all individuals have the potential to deepen their understanding through collaboration.
Besides, observation of well-designed collaborative learning reveals that students who stay mostly silent during
group  work  still listen to  others' words   and say simple   but important    words that provoke    discussion and
perspective shifting  among    the  members.   This  concept is   similar to Greeno   and   van  de Sande's   (2007)
constructive listening and Engle and Conant's (2002) problematizing. However, such observation depends on
"emergent" group conversation, which we do not know how to replicate systematically.
         Revoicing is a good way both to demonstrate active listening and to mark ideas worth reflecting. In this
study, robots react to paired students' discussions with different ways of revoicing. Revoicing originally refers
to a teacher's  repeating  or  rephrasing  students' utterances.  Many  studies  have  focused   on the pedagogical
features of revoicing   (e.g., guiding  students' attention to critical contents,   giving ownership  to  them,  and
positioning them to each other) (O'Conner & Michaels, 1996). In order to make the robot a listener, however,
we must use student-like rather than teacher-like revoicing. Thus, our robots perform minimum, stingy revoicing
that simply  repeats  students'    utterances of  keywords,  regardless   of their  correctness.  We  compare    this
"minimum revoicing condition" with a "guiding revoicing condition" in which the robot adds evaluative phrases
to keywords in order to guide students' attention to critical contents. At a glance, the latter condition seems to
outperform  the former,   but  we  aim  to demonstrate  that the   opposite  is the case,  since teacher, leader-like
revoicing makes students passive and dependent on the robot, rather than promoting their own problem-solving.
         If revoicing also serves to mark important ideas, it may provoke conflicts among contrasting ideas of
students who engage in PFL tasks. The remaining question about PFL is how collaborative groping leads to
learning from a lecture: specifically, whether (1) the groping only has to raise students' agency, and the quality
of the search does not need to be high, or (2) the search must cover critical points and raise their awareness
closest to the threshold for receiving the lecture. By using a challenging physics problem as a groping task that
solicits conflicting ideas (mental models), we analyze the collaborative process as search, proposal, question,

and criticism of mental  models, and    the effects of a robot's revoicing  on   this process. We  also   prepare    a
"human-only condition" of groups of three students and compare it with the minimum revoicing condition to
see if a robot that does not express its own ideas but just listens and re-utters helps students' construction of
mental models by problematizing the differences among their ideas and keeping their multi-vocality.

Method
Participants
Forty-five undergraduates of a Japanese university participated. We assigned six pairs (12 students) each to the
minimum revoicing condition and the guiding revoicing condition, and seven groups of three students (a total of
21 students) to the control (human-only) condition. Members in a pair or group knew each other well. None of
the students knew the tasks, and there were no remarkable differences in their physics ability among the groups.
We used the desktop robot "Robovie-W" for the experiment. It was 30cm tall and had 17 degrees of freedom
with a built-in camera, speaker, and microphone. Robot utterances and actions can be generated and adjusted
with a remote control by an operator, and utterances are achieved by voice-synthesizing software (XIMERA).

Tasks

Bobbin Problem
We chose the "bobbin problem" from Anzai and Yokoyama (1984) as the main task. The problem is multiple-
choice, to predict the direction of movement of a bobbin as illustrated in Fig. 1. It is quite difficult to determine
the correct answer as (1). More than 90% of university students as physics beginners select incorrect answers
(2) and (3). According to Anzai and Yokoyama's analysis, beginners tend to make mistakes by drawing on their
experience that the bobbin rolls clockwise when the string is pulled from the "fixed" center of the bobbin.

"The centers of two circular frames are interconnected by an axle, and a string is wound around it like a bobbin,
as illustrated in the figure below. What will happen if you pull the string as shown in the figure? The discs may
roll, but never slide. Mark the number that you think is correct. Let's discuss your reason for selecting it."

          (1) The bobbin rolls to the left (counterclockwise).
          (2) The bobbin rolls to the right (clockwise).
          (3) The bobbin does not move.
          (4) Other. (Write your answer concretely.)

                                             Fig. 1. Bobbin problem.

Transfer Problem: Toilet Paper Problem
We  selected  a transfer problem from    Anzai   (1991)  (hereafter "the  toilet paper  problem"). This    problem
questions the movement of an object when the positions of the fulcrum and the power point are changed from
those depicted in Fig. 1 and pulled as shown in Fig. 2. The correct answer is (2), but the participant who simply
assumes that the object always rolls to the left when the string is pulled to the left will select the wrong answer.

"An axle was passed through the center of an object and a string was wound on it, as depicted in the figure
below. What will happen if you pull the string as shown in the figure? The object may roll, but never slide.
Mark the number you think correct, and discuss your reason for selecting it."
          (1) The object rolls to the left (counterclockwise).
          (2) The object rolls to the right (clockwise).
          (3) The object does not move.
          (4) Other. (Write your answer concretely.)

Lecture
For the bobbin problem, we delivered a lecture, the key points of which are as follows: "First, let's regard the
contact point between the bobbin and desk as the fulcrum, and the point from where the string comes as the
power point (Fig. 3a). Next, consider the line segment that passes both of these points as the axis of the bobbin,
and you may   understand   more  easily that the line  segment   falls to the left around the  fulcrum    (Fig. 3b).
However, the bobbin is circular, not being composed of a single line segment. Therefore, if you assume the
circle contains innumerable line segments, you can see the axes will fall to the left, one after another. As a result,
the circle rolls to the left (Fig. 3c)." In order to provide exactly the same explanation for every condition, we
recorded the lecture beforehand, cut it, and attached voice files with a total of 13 power-point slides.

Procedure

Minimum Revoicing Condition
First, each pair of students had 5min to interact freely with the robot. For ice-breaking, the robot asked the
names of students and called them by their names, and they exchanged information about their origins. Other
operations were left to the discretion of the operator of the remote control. After a brief explanation of the
experiment, we distributed sheets of paper to the students describing the bobbin problem in Fig. 1. The students
attempted to solve the problem for 10min while talking freely. The robot first asked students to read the problem
aloud, in order to enhance their relationship. In the prediction phase, the robot revoiced the students' discussion,
the details of which are presented in the next section. In the discussion phase, we distributed sewing machine
bobbins. After conducting the experiment and confirming the result, the students discussed reasons for 6min
(Fig. 4a). The robot     also performed    revoicing. An atmosphere             was created so that the robot       observed  the
experiment as the students discussed while pulling the bobbin and participated in their discussions. Thereafter,
the students listened to the lecture for 5min, as displayed on the screen. The robot also turned its face to the
screen to create the appearance of viewing it with the students (Fig. 4b). Upon completion of the explanations,
the robot turned its face to the students again. If the students did not engage in discussion, it questioned, "Did
you understand the explanations? Why did it go to the left?" If they were discussing the explanations, the robot
waited a while and then asked these questions. After receiving answers from the students, the robot questioned,
"What are the key points or keywords?" When only one student answered the first question, the robot asked the
member who did not answer. Lastly, the robot asked students for summarization, "The lecturer mentioned the
fulcrum, power point, and circle, didn't he? How did they relate to this problem?" Five minutes was allowed for
the above discussion. Upon completion of discussion, power to the robot was turned off.
         Next, we distributed sheets of paper describing the toilet-paper problem in Fig. 2. The students were
told to talk freely for 5min, and to write down the answer and the reason for it. If the group did not reach a
consensus, they were allowed different answers. These answers provide with primary data for deciding their
performance of the transfer problem. After the teacher demonstrated the answer using toilet paper in front of the
classroom, students spent another 5min discussing the reason and then answered the question again. Lastly,
questionnaires and interviews about the impression of the robot were conducted for 10min. The questionnaires
contained six items (e.g., "Do you want to learn together with Robovie again?" "Did you think that Robovie
knew  the  answer to     the  bobbin   problem?"  and  "What partner        do    you  think Robovie  would         be if it were
human?"). All these processes were recorded on video, ICR, and the log of the remote-control system. The
groups were separated far enough from each other for clear recording and avoidance of contamination.

Guiding Revoicing Condition
The procedures for the guiding revoicing condition were the same as those for the minimum revoicing condition,
except for the method of revoicing, as described in the next section.

Control (Human-Only) Condition
The procedures for the control condition were the same as for the two conditions above, except that three
students formed a    group    and   the prompts for discussion        after the   lecture were given  on a piece        of paper.
Questions about "the reason for rolling to the left," "key points/words," and "relationships among the fulcrum,
power point, and circle" were printed, and students were instructed to discuss them at their own pace.

Experiment Manipulation: Robot's Revoicing
The  robot  merely repeated  the keywords    that students    mentioned  under    the minimum   revoicing  condition;
however, it reacted affirmatively to correct keywords and negatively to incorrect keywords as terms in physics
under the guiding revoicing condition. For example, under the minimum revoicing condition if students said "It
rolls to the right" (wrong prediction), the robot said only "Rolls to the right"; however, under the guiding
revoicing condition it suggested a negative evaluation by adding a phrase like "`Does it roll to the right?"
         We implemented revoicing in two ways: the operator pressed the button for a preloaded input prompt,
or input the prompt by text. To load the keywords that would appear frequently in students' discussions into the
operation system, we observed 24 extra juniors as they discussed the bobbin problem prior to this experiment in
a similar experiment procedure. We identified frequently used words both in prediction and discussion phases.
These "hot" words included correct physical terms, incorrect ones, and unrelated ones. The left-hand column of
Table 1 lists candidate keywords for preloading in the prediction phase under the minimum revoicing condition.
Under the guiding revoicing condition, we added phrases (in red, underlined letters in the right-hand column of
Table 1) to these keywords (most of these phrases were expressed by Japanese sentence-ending particles such as
yo, ne, yone, or kana, and were difficult to translate). We added three utterances of "evasion" to avoid questions
from students in order to position the students, rather than the robots, as task-doers, along with three utterances
for "the  answer"  and   15 utterances for "reasons."   Eight   of these   utterances  were  manipulated   across  the
conditions. For   the discussion phase,   we   prepared  20    preliminary utterances   for the  minimum    revoicing
condition  (1 for "answer"   ("Rolls  to the left!"), 12   for "reasons,"  3    for "evasion," and 4 for   "emotional
expression"). Utterances of emotion were expression of surprise at the experiment result (e.g., "Oh, why?").
Because they were unnatural as utterances of the guiding-revoicing robot, two of the four utterances were
deleted. Therefore, 18 utterances were used for the guiding revoicing condition. Among these, seven were
manipulated across the conditions. We manipulated a total of 15 of 41 utterances (36.6%) in sum.

         For free utterances, the minimum revoicing condition allowed free utterances (inputs) on the principle
that "when a cluster of utterances is heard and the two students become silent, the robot will speak the keywords
of each cluster." Under the guiding revoicing condition, the robot also performed utterances on the principle that
"it may guide students to the correct answer by adding an evaluating phrase to the keyword, but never tell the
answer." We appointed two postgraduates and four undergraduates who were familiar with the bobbin problem
and well-trained as remote-control operators. To minimize the differences between the conditions, we had them
take charge of the remote control under one condition as many times as under the other condition. Actually, no
large difference in either the numbers or the ratios of preliminarily input sentences and freely input sentences
was observed between the conditions. Revoicings were made 8.8 times in the minimum revoicing condition and
7.5 times in the guiding revoicing condition on average per pair in the experiment.

Results
In this section, we first confirm students' performance of the transfer task, then examine their feeling of agency
through their perception of the robot, and finally analyze the collaborative process and the robots' effect on it.

Performance of the Transfer Problem

We examined the ratios of students who were able to correctly predict the transfer (toilet paper) problem and
those who were able to explain the reason, based on the relationship between the fulcrum and the power point as
described in the Lecture section (e.g., "The axis falls to the right because the power point is located under the
fulcrum."). Fig. 5 indicates that the correct answer ratio was the highest under the guiding revoicing condition,
followed by the minimum revoicing condition and then the human-only condition, but the difference is not
significant. However, the ratio of description of the correct reason under the minimum revoicing condition
exceeded those under other conditions. The chi square test indicated significant differences among conditions
(2(2) = 6.69, p < .05), with residual analysis indicating that more students in the minimum revoicing condition
gave correct explanations than expected. Considering that no students in the minimum revoicing condition
correctly predicted the bobbin problem, they had no superior prior knowledge, but learned from the discussions
and lecture, and transferred their knowledge appropriately to the subsequent, toilet-paper problem.

Perceived Roles of the Robot
Next, we examined the results of post-questionnaires and interviews to determine the students' perception of the
robot. First, the ratio of students who felt that the robot knew the answer was higher under the guiding revoicing
condition (75%) than under the minimum revoicing condition (58%). We classified their perceptions of the
robot into five categories using their literal expressions (Table 2). While 58% indicated that the robot was like
their friend under the minimum revoicing condition, nobody answered this way under the guiding revoicing
condition. Instead, the robot was perceived as a heterogeneous, obtrusive being, such as a teacher or facilitator
who gave guidance or as a child "who                      always asks   `why?'"        Corresponding         to this result, 83%  under  the
minimum revoicing condition indicated that they wanted to learn with the robot again, whereas only 50% did so
under the guiding revoicing condition. In summary, the students in the minimum revoicing condition tended to
perceive the robot as their thinking partner who did not know the answer. The students did not seem to rely on
the robot but to think of themselves as epistemic agents.

Collaborative Groping Processes
These results imply that the subtle difference in revoicing made all the difference in test performance and
perception of the robot. In order to determine how the students deepened their understanding through interaction
with the robot, we analyzed the process of collaborative groping before the lecture. Tables 3 presents excerpts of
typical pairs under the minimum revoicing condition, and Table 4 presents those under the guiding revoicing
condition. Before tracing them in detail, we explain types of utterance and mental models.
       Types  of Utterance: We   roughly                     classified  students'      and robots'         utterances  into  six types: the
students' "questioning" of answers to the robot, their "reasoning" of answers and justification, "observation" of
experiment results, "revoicing-back (re-uttering)" to the robot's revoicing (e.g., line 20 of Table 3), and the
robot's "evasion" and "revoicing." Using these types, we could determine the discourse pattern among the
students and the robot (e.g., how the robot avoided students' questioning and let them act as reasoners).
       Mental Models of the Bobbin Problem: We coded utterances and gestures of students' "reasoning"
into five mental models (and their variations) in Fig. 6. These models are developed from Anzai and Yokoyama
(1984) and our observations. The tension-force model (Fig. 6a) simply considers the tension force in the string
that pulls the bobbin to the left (broad arrow in Fig. 6), resulting in the correct answer. Although this model has
a weakness of not specifying how the string behaves as the bobbin moves, we often observed that it re-emerged

in students' discussions as if they could not ignore it to the end. The rotation-only model (Fig. 6b) exploits
experiential knowledge    of something   rotating  around  a    fixed axle (e.g., toilet paper).  This model   does   not
predict the direction of the bobbin movement. Expanding the rotation-only model, the rotation-to-right model
(Fig. 6c) assumes that the rotation creates the force to move to the right, resulting in the wrong answer. The
tension-force model   and  the   rotate-to-right model    predict opposite  directions   of the   bobbin; however,    the
students referred to them naturally, as if they believed both. Thus, these models are fragmental, multiple, and
autonomous    objects (Williams,   Holland  &    Stevens,  1983).  However,     the students  sometimes     struggled to
integrate them, through which two other models developed. One is the correct model (Fig. 6d), which predicts
that the bobbin   rotates to the left with winding   the  string.  Interestingly, students  often  referred to  it while
denying its possibility. In this sense, this model is not fully scientific but only phenomenological, yet closest to
scientific models such as that delivered by the lecture. The other is the force-balance model (Fig. 6e), which
claims that the tension force balanced with the rotation (or friction) force, resulting in no movement (wrong
answer). Using this framework, we can analyze how widely the students explored the problem space and how
closely they approached the scientific models.

         Pair in the Minimum-Revoicing Condition: As indicated in Table 3, Pair A under the minimum
revoicing condition, especially Student A1, first asked the robot for the answer, but the robot gave evasive
responses (lines 1-6). The students then began to reason and express various models (lines 7-11), which caused
conflicts between the models (italicized in lines 10-11). After the robot gave evasive responses again (lines 12-
13), A1 developed his model into the rotate-to-right model, against which Student A2 protested from using the
tension-force model   (lines 14-15).  Here, the   robot   first revoiced   keywords,   which   were  revoiced  back   by
Student  A1   and integrated  into his  explanation  (underlined      in lines 18-20).   That is, A1   used the  robot's
subjective mode (if-clause) at line 19, and continued reasoning about the importance of the rotation (since
preloaded revoicings are not always exactly the same as students' expressions, some students utilized such new
forms of expressions). As a result, Student A1 leaned to the rotate-to-right model; in contrast, A2 seemed to
focus on the tension force (line 15) and simulated the leftward movement again (lines 21-22), resulting in
externalization of the correct model. Even though he might not have believed this model, it is important that the
students were exposed to it. As a result, they focused on the movement of the string as soon as they observed the
experiment results (line 102), the utterance of which was also revoiced by the robot and revoiced back by
themselves (lines 103-104) and developed into another model (line 105). In summary, the robot's revoicing
neither happened often nor guided students to scientific models (line 20); instead, it indirectly problematized the
difference and conflict among the models and pushed the students towards integration.
         Pair in the Guiding-Revoicing Condition: In contrast, Pair B under the guiding revoicing condition
first talked about reasons (Table 4, lines 1-2); however, with the robot's guiding revoicing at line 6, Student B1
noticed the sentence ending particle of the question ("kana") and interpreted that the robot knew the answer
(line 9). They then engaged in obtaining the answer from the robot.
         In sum, the interactional patterns of both pairs rapidly formed through interactions in the early stage of
the prediction phase, where participants neither knew the correct answer nor knew if the robot knew it, and
might expect to gain it from the robot. In that stage, guiding revoicing tended to deprive the students of agency.

Mental Models and Subsequent Learning
We analyzed the quantity and quality of mental models to which the students referred. As indicated in Table 3,
Pair A referred to more kinds of models more times (seven kinds, ten times) than Pair B in Table 4 (one kind,
two times). Qualitatively, Pair A questioned the rotate-to-right model and referred to the correct model, which
was not observed in Pair B. Table 5 summarizes all the results of the three conditions during the prediction and
discussion phases, broken into correct and incorrect explainers of the transfer problem. The number indicates
the average per student, and that in parentheses indicates standard deviation per student. "Referring to Correct
model or/and Questioning Rotate-to-right Model" means percentages of the pairs/groups who referred to the
correct model or questioned the rotate-to-right model in the total of pairs/groups in each cell. Because such
references were infrequent and we assumed that exposure to them was important, we took the pair or group as a
unit of analysis and examined whether at least one member made such references. We also grouped a pair or
group as "correct" if at least one member correctly explained the transfer problem.

tended to question the wrong, rotate-to-right model and/or verbalize the correct model (also shaded in the table).
These results imply that the quality of the collaborative groping should be as high as possible for receiving the
lecture. In addition, the minimum revoicing condition in total contributed to raising this quality (see "n" of
Table 5). Space prevents us from describing how the revoicing functioned in all the pairs, but we often observed
"revoicing-back." For example, in one pair, when one member referred to the rotate-to-right model as "If we
pull it this way, it produces the force for the bobbin to rotate to that way," the robot just revoiced "Force" and
the other member said "Force, pull, force, pull... So if we pull it this way, the force works this way too." The
latter member, having the tension-force model in mind, seemed to take advantage of the robot's revoicing and
put that model on the table again, which kept their multi-vocality and sustained the discussion.

Discussion
This study included a robot in a discussion group of collaborative learning, and let it perform revoicing to the
other members in a minimum, stingy way or in a facilitative, guiding way. We found that minimum-revoicing
promoted students' performance of the transfer problem and egalitarian perception of the robot, which implies
students' agency as task-doers of problem solving. Process analyses indicated that guiding-revoicing made the
students perceive the robot as a knower; whereas minimum revoicing caused them to perceive it as a co-solver.
Even  though  the  minimum-revoicing   robot provided    no new   information,    it listened  to students'  words
heedfully and revoiced them. Reciprocally, the students did not ignore the robot but listened to it and took
advantage of the revoiced words. Since the task provoked multiple mental models, the students often confronted
conflicts with one another. The robot's revoicing contributed to making explicit such conflicts, letting role-
exchange happen in the students, and sustaining the discussion, which forced students to integrate these models.
        This  paper provides  PFL  researchers   with the  finding   that collaborative  groping   should   prepare
students at the highest levels of understanding for receiving a lecture. Schwartz and Bransford (1998) once
reported that groping activity creates "a time for telling" for teachers; however, this study implies that such a
time may   be very limited. A time for  telling comes  diversely,  depending   on    students' readiness, and  thus
repeated chances to access instructional resources are needed.
        The present study has many limitations in addition to the small sample size. The experiment situation
in which the students first worked with the robot might cause them to focus too much on the robot's words (the
revoicings were often made   but ignored in  the human-only    condition),  to which   the second   author  is now
conducting experiments that  include successive  opportunities   for children  to interact  with  the robot. Some
operators reported difficulty in remote-controlling (e.g., when to avoid, when to revoice, and how to revoice).
With more findings of HRI and HRL, we should design a longer collaborative learning environment.
