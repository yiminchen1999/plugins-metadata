          Abstract: Prior research has established that active participation and collaboration by students
          results in multiple benefits during wiki-based CSCL activities.  However, achieving such be-
          havior can be a challenge without external motivation. To increase active participation and
          collaboration by users, we developed an enhanced wiki called the Written Agora.      Using pop-
          ular Web 2.0 features, our wiki provides additional means of participation and aims to encour-
          age   direct communication  and  collaboration between users.    Additionally, using intelligent
          features, we enable the wiki system itself to also participate during collaboration. In this pa-
          per, we analyze the results of a study using the Written Agora in a classroom for two semes-
          ters. We discover that simply including such features is not necessarily enough to cause their
          use or improve collaboration.   However, encouraging the use of these features resulted in not
          only greater than expected use, but more diverse and higher quality collaboration by users.

Introduction
Within recent years, one popular tool for computer supported, collaborative learning (CSCL) has been wiki
software. Wikis have been used for a wide-variety of CSCL activities, including hosting supplementary material
to classroom lectures (Cole, 2009), building glossaries of important terms (Peterson, 2009), group essay writing
(Khandaker & Soh, 2009), and contributing to a publically shared knowledge-base (Lampe et. al, 2012).
          The use of wikis for CSCL has resulted in several positive, documented results. For example, Wheeler
et. al (2008) found that students wanted to create high quality content given the possibility and excitement of
broad information dissemination, as well as a self-reported increase in student writing and critical thinking
skills. Cress and Kimmerle (2008) developed a model of student interactions with a wiki, focusing on assimila-
tion (addition of new knowledge) and accommodation (reconstruction of existing knowledge) both internally
within students and externally in the wiki between a group of collaborating users.   Based on this model, Mos-
kaliuk, Kimmerle, and Cress (2008; 2012) verified that features of wiki content (e.g., levels of incongruity, re-
dundancy and polarity with student prior knowledge) can encourage student learning.      Lampe et. al (2012) ob-
served   that some     students were motivated   to continue  contributing to wiki  systems    such     as Wikipedia
(http://www.wikipedia.org) after producing content as part of classroom activities. Thus, using a wiki for CSCL
can benefit students both during classroom activities, as well as beyond the classroom.
          However, one common concern has been revealed from the use of wikis in CSCL.         Specifically, sever-
al studies (e.g., Ebner et. al, 2008; Cole, 2009) report that students tend not to participate in wiki activities with-
out proper external motivation (e.g., requiring participation by assigning points towards grades).       This lack of
participation   is troublesome   because without contributing during wiki-based  activities,   students    will fail to
achieve the aforementioned benefits of using a wiki for CSCL.    Furthermore, research outside of CSCL has also
documented the benefits of and concerns over active participation during wiki activities.      For example, users
who are more active while first exploring the wiki system are much more likely to continue participating in the
community in the future (e.g., Panciera et. al, 2009; Antin et. al, 2012). Thus, initial buy-in is very important.
Furthermore, Kittur and Kraut (2008) and Arazy and Nov (2010) found that articles on Wikipedia that contained
more active collaboration by users (e.g., high levels of activity on the corresponding "discussion" page where
users can leave comments for other users) achieved a higher subjective quality (e.g., content accuracy and com-
pleteness).   Therefore, active participation by users is paramount to achieving the benefits of wiki-based activi-
ties both for individual users (e.g., student learning) and the system (e.g., better quality content).
          In order to improve the use of wikis as a tool for CSCL, we propose an advanced, intelligent wiki sys-
tem called the Written Agora. Within the Written Agora, we augment the traditional wiki framework with ad-
ditional features designed to offer more modes of collaboration to encourage greater participation by users.         To
achieve this goal, we leverage popular features common to other collaborative Web 2.0 applications (e.g., Ama-
zon, http://www.amazon.com; Facebook, http://www.facebook.com; Reddit, http://www.reddit.com) with which
users are likely already familiar, such as page ratings, keyword tagging, and threaded discussions.        These addi-
tional features enable users to participate in different ways than they would in a traditional wiki (e.g., just by
viewing and editing pages), hopefully endearing or empowering users and subsequently increasing participation.
That is, users who might not have been comfortable or well equipped to participate in traditional wiki-based
activities now have additional ways to contribute to the collaboration process, such as providing feedback or
summarizing the key content of pages.      These software features also provide additional means for external as-
similation and accommodation (Cress & Kimmerle, 2008) through adding additional information to wiki pages
(e.g., ratings) and coordinating transformations of knowledge (e.g., threaded discussions), which could boost
student learning similar to features in wiki content (Moskaliuk, Kimmerle & Cress, 2008; 2012).

        Furthermore, we also add intelligent features to enable the wiki itself to be a proactive participant in
collaboration while supporting users with their tasks. For instance, as a user browses pages in the Written Ago-
ra, we provide automated recommendations of similar pages the user might be interested in viewing based on
the content of those pages. This improves the end-user experience by both helping the user navigate through the
broad expanse of topics present in a collaborative wiki to target topics of interest in greater depth, as well as
improving user knowledge by encouraging increased usage of the wiki.          Moreover, it potentially decreases the
burden of initial system usage, which could result in more active and sustained participation by users.    Similar
intelligent features have been demonstrated to be beneficial to wiki participation both (1) within a CSCL setting,
such as intelligently forming groups which increases participation (Khandaker & Soh, 2009), and (2) outside of
CSCL, such as recommending pages to edit or content to include in order to increase page quality and coverage
(Cosley et. al, 2007; Kong et. al, 2010).
        In this paper, we evaluate an experimental study conducted to investigate the impact of including addi-
tional Web 2.0 and intelligent features within the Written Agora to increase active participation by students.  We
consider the results of deploying our wiki system over the course of two semesters in an undergraduate class-
room setting. Consistent with prior results of general wiki usage (e.g., Ebner et. al, 2008; Cole, 2009), we find
that simply including such features is not necessarily enough to result in their use or improve collaboration.
However, encouraging the use of these features resulted in greater than expected use and more diverse and high-
er quality collaboration by users. Therefore, their inclusion does result in a net benefit for students, but does not
necessarily address the active participation concern.  Based on our results, we hypothesize several possible ave-
nues to tackle this important problem without requiring external motivation (e.g., graded participation).

The Written Agora
The features of the Written Agora can be categorized into three primary categories: (1) traditional features
commonly found in other existing wiki systems, (2) additional Web 2.0 features, used to offer further modes of
participation and to enhance communication between students, and (3) intelligent features, enabling the system
itself to actively participate in collaboration and support user activities. Table 1 summarizes these features.    In
the following, we elaborate on the additional Web 2.0 and intelligent features studied in this paper.

Web 2.0 Features
Beyond traditional wikis, the Written Agora includes additional Web 2.0 features common to many other types
of contemporary collaboration systems on the web (e.g., social networking sites).     These features provide addi-
tional means of participation for users, and also enable advanced collaboration and enhanced communication
between users  to promote   improved   collaborative work and higher  quality    pages.  Additionally, the features
enable the wiki system to store not only the end product of collaboration (e.g., shared knowledge), but also by-
products (e.g., ratings, consensus) and serve as a self-contained process for collaboration without the need for
coupling with external tools (e.g., email, instant messaging), which could be inconvenient for users.
Page Ratings: Users can rate pages based on their quality using a scale from 1 (bad) to 5 (great) stars.  Ratings
from multiple users are scored using a cumulative average to define an overall user-supplied quality metric on
pages. The overall and current user's ratings are displayed on each page, as well as when browsing for pages, to
assist users in quickly evaluating whether a page might be worth reading to increase their own knowledge, or
whether or not a page is a good candidate for their editing to improve the overall knowledge within the system.
Prior work has shown that visualizing information about pages can improve trust in the information stored in
wiki systems (Kittur et. al, 2008), which we believe might also be achieved through community ratings.
Keyword Tagging: Users can also tag pages with important keywords, useful for both (1) summarizing the im-
portant concepts within a page, as well as (2) organizing pages around similar topics.      Moreover, tag clouds

 ISLS                                                                                                         177
CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                        Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

displaying the most popular keywords based on their frequency of use allows users to observe a current snap-
shot of the current knowledge within the wiki system.    Keywords also assist with page navigation towards top-
ics of interest--clicking on a keyword either on a page or in the tag cloud searches for all pages either tagged
with that word or containing the word in its content.
Threaded Discussions: Each page supports collaborative discussions between users through threaded comments,
allowing users to start new topics of discussion and respond to one another's comments.       For example, users
might organize their edits for the page, mediate conflicts, or propose new ideas and suggestions to improve the
quality of the page.  They can also ask questions of one another and receive direct responses to promote en-
hanced understanding of the page's content.    These discussions provide organized, topic-based communication,
in contrast with a more free-form and less organized style of discussion, as in discussion pages on Wikipedia.

Intelligent Features
Another novel aspect of the Written Agora is the inclusion of intelligent features, common to other applications
with intelligent user interfaces. These features enable the system to provide its own active support to individual
and group user activities. For example, the system can assist users when searching for desired information by
leveraging its own knowledge of the system's contents, and it can organize its content and link related pages
based on shared topics.  Our intelligent features are powered by a multiagent system adhering to the Adaptive
Knowledge Assistants framework (Eck & Soh, 2012), where individual and system agents are used to provide
tailored support to user activities within the Written Agora.
Keyword Extraction: Similar to keyword tagging by users, the Written Agora also automatically analyzes every
page and extracts the most important keywords, which assists users in (1) finding relevant topics within pages,
as well as (2) organizing pages containing similar concepts and ideas.
Page Recommendations: Moreover, using the keyword content found by automated extraction and tagged by
users, the system also recommends similar pages to the one the user is currently viewing.    These recommenda-
tions are presented in an unobtrusive side panel to help the user navigate through the wide expanse of the sys-
tem's content without distracting the user from her current activities. Such recommendations are useful for as-
sisting the user improve her knowledge through both the breadth of related concepts to the current page in the
wiki, as well as the depth of understanding of the current topic by targeting pages describing the topic in more
detail. Of note, this feature differs from prior recommendations in wikis (e.g., Cosley et. al, 2007; Kong et. al,
2010) in that our recommendations are intended to grow each individual's internal knowledge through exploring
existing pages, rather than intending to grow the community's external knowledge through expanding the shared
information in the system.  In the future, we plan to explore both types of recommendations.
User Tracking: The Written Agora monitors and records all user activity within the wiki, including which page
revisions are viewed by users, which keywords are tagged or removed from pages, and what recommended pag-
es are viewed. For each activity, the system tracks: (1) who performed the activity, (2) what activity was per-
formed, (3) when the activity occurred, (4) what page the user was viewing, and (5) any object corresponding to
the activity (e.g., rating, comment). Using this tracked information allows us to evaluate the collaborative be-
havior of users and provides information to know how best to support users during their collaboration.

Study and Methods
As described previously, the primary purpose of the design of the Written Agora was to create an advanced wiki
system that (1) encourages opportunities for participation between users, and (2) actively participates with users
in the collaboration process. We conducted    a user-based study evaluating the impact  of support provided by the
Written Agora on user activity and collaboration through both additional Web 2.0 and intelligent features.      In
the following, we outline (1) the research questions guiding our study, (2) our proposed hypotheses answering
these questions, (3) the data set used for our analysis, and (4) the methods used to evaluate our hypotheses.

Research Questions
Guiding our research in CSCL through the use of the Written Agora are two primary research questions, each
corresponding to different types of support for active participation and collaboration:
Q1: How does the inclusion of Web 2.0 features intended to encourage more opportunities for participation, as
well as active communication and collaboration between users, affect the activities and performance of users?
Q2: How does the inclusion of intelligent features intended to enable the system to become an active participant
during collaboration through interactions with users affect the activities and performance of users?
         With respect to Q1, we aim in this study to assess the impact of including (1) page ratings, (2) keyword
tagging, and (3) threaded discussions in the wiki system in order to potentially increase active participation and

 ISLS                                                                                                        178
CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                        Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

collaboration amongst users. With respect to Q2, we aim to assess the impact of including (1) automated key-
word parsing, and (2) related page recommendations on the overall collaboration activities of users.

Hypotheses
Based on these two research questions, we propose several hypotheses stating our expectations about the impact
of Web 2.0 and intelligent features on user participation and collaboration:
H1: The inclusion of additional Web 2.0 features will increase the amount of user activity and collaboration.
H2: The inclusion of additional Web 2.0 features will provide more opportunities for participation and collabo-
ration, spreading out activity from only a few users (e.g., Panciera et. al, 2009; Antin et. al, 2012) to most users.
H3: The inclusion of intelligent features will result in more page views (through searches for related pages with
similar extracted keywords and followed recommendations).
H4: The inclusion of Web 2.0 and intelligent features will boost the quality of collaboration through more ac-
tive collaboration amongst users and with the system.
         While these hypotheses are intuitive responses to the research questions posed above, they are not
guaranteed to hold true in practice. For example, we might observe that collaboration fundamentally follows a
power law distribution (Antin et. al, 2012) where only a few users perform nearly all activities, regardless of the
type of activity (e.g., editing, rating, commenting) while other users perform few if any activities. If so, the ad-
ditional features might not result in any increase in total participation as the few active users are already near a
maximal amount of activity without these features.   Furthermore, the inclusion of intelligent features could have
no impact on user behavior as users might not trust or simply ignore the system's active participation.

Data Sets
For this study, we consider two semesters of deployment (Fall 2011 and Spring 2012) of the Written Agora
branded as the Duckweed Paper Exchange (DPE, http://duckweed.unl.edu), a component of the Duckweed Pro-
ject (http://www.unl.edu/cbrassil/duckweed-project-0) within the School of Biological Sciences at the Universi-
ty of Nebraska-Lincoln.   In this project, students conduct group-based lab experiments studying the growth of
Spirodela polyrhiza in  different  treatment  conditions.  Based on these experiments, students write their own
individual reports about their group's activities, and then the entire group collaboratively forms a final group
report detailing their experiment. Within the Duckweed Project, the DPE serves as a tool and repository for the
creation and  archival of  these  group reports.   Moreover,   the reports within the DPE  constitute     a student-
produced journal, where students consider past reports in the design of their own experiments and reference
prior work by other students in their own reports. Using   the DPE, students practice scientific writing.
         Prior to our study, the DPE was prepopulated with one previous semester's group reports (written
without the DPE) as an initial seeding of content, as well as one semester's initial usage of the DPE as a pilot
study to evaluate the feasibility of the DPE. Thus, between two and three semesters worth of prior reports were
available during our study for students to view, rate, and discuss in order to guide their experiments and writing.
In both semesters, students were only required to create their final group report using the DPE.      Alternatively,
they were also allowed to create their own individual drafts within the system before forming a group report,
although this step could also be performed outside of the DPE.      In the Fall 2011 semester, Web 2.0 features
were offered for use but students were not required to use these features.    Later, in the Spring 2012 semester,
students were required to perform a minimum level of collaborative activities to encourage further collaboration
amongst students. These requirements included rating 3 pages, tagging 2 keywords, and offering 5 comments.
Moreover, for this later semester, we added the intelligent features considered in our study (automated keyword
parsing and related page recommendations).     Overall, 47 and 41 users from the Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 se-
mesters agreed to participate in our study, respectively.  Of these users, 36 and 28, respectively, agreed also to
allow us to consider their earned grades in our study.     Thus, our data sets consist of all of the activities per-
formed by these 88 users, including the use of the Web 2.0 and intelligent features in the DPE, as well as the
grades earned by 64 users. We would like to note that  the  grading of student reports was performed by impartial
graduate teaching assistants assigned to the course who were not part of our research project. They were made
aware that a study was ongoing, but were not given information about what the study measured or our analysis
approach. Thus, there was no bias in the grading to impact our results.

Evaluation Methods
To evaluate our hypotheses, we propose the following methods.      First, we consider the level of participation and
collaboration by users cumulatively in each semester, measured by counting the number of times users per-
formed each type of action: ratings, keywords added, comments, recommendations followed, edits, and views.
These values are compared against one another both (1) within each semester to assess how users collaborated
as a collective whole and how the use of one type of activity affected the other types of activities performed by

 ISLS                                                                                                         179
CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                          Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

users, and (2) across semesters to determine how the requirement of using Web 2.0 features affected user col-
laboration behaviors.  Second, we also look at the relationships between feature usage (measured using correla-
tions) to learn more about how individual users who exploited or ignored the Web 2.0 and intelligent features
behaved in general.  Our goal is to better understand the relationship between these activities and user behavior,
including whether or not users adopted specific collaborative roles through the use of     these features. Finally, we
also evaluate the quality of collaboration by comparing the grades received for the groups' reports.         Here, we
aim to understand what relationship exists between the level and type of participation and collaboration per-
formed by users and the quality of the end product of collaboration.

Results

Use of Additional Web 2.0 Features and their Effect on Collaboration
First, we analyze the use of the additional Web 2.0 features during the users' wiki-based activities while writing
their reports in wiki pages. To evaluate how often these features were exploited during collaboration, we pre-
sent the number of actions performed per user, ranked in decreasing order, in terms of (a) ratings made, (b)
keywords tagged, and (c) comments posted from both the Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 semesters in Figs. 1a-c.
         From these figures, we observe that in the Fall 2011 semester when usage was not required, very few
students used  these features during their wiki-based activities. In fact, of the 47 users participating in our study,
only 3, 7, and 9 users rated pages, tagged keywords, or posted    comments,  respectively.  Moreover,    the few users
who did exploit these features used them very infrequently.   Thus, simply including additional types and modes
of collaboration did not necessarily increase the level of participation by students. This matches the results from
previous studies of wiki-based activities for CSCL where few users participated without external motivations
(e.g., graded requirements) (Ebner et. al, 2008; Cole, 2009). However, we observe a dramatic change of behav-
ior in the Spring 2012 semester when minimum levels of activity were required.         Here, a larger percentage of
users not only used these features to meet the minimum requirements (represented by horizontal black lines in
Figs. 1a-c), but most users went above and beyond what was necessary.        This implies that once users were en-
couraged to use the features, they perceived a greater value in their use through experience and made greater use
of these features than necessary.   We hypothesize that the use of Web 2.0 features in wiki-based collaboration
requires reaching a (albeit small) "critical mass" where enough users make use of the features for their benefits
to be perceived and their use sustained by the community.     In the future, we plan to further investigate how to
achieve and sustain such a crowd-based effect without requiring external motivations.
         Second, we analyze the effect of the use of Web 2.0 features encouraging more active collaboration
amongst users on both the (1) behavior and (2) quality of collaboration.     We begin by presenting the number of
pages edited per user in decreasing order in Fig. 1e. We observe that the use of Web 2.0 features appear to have
had a significant effect on the editing behavior of users. On the one hand, in the Fall 2011 semester when users
made little use of the Web 2.0 features, users generally performed similar numbers of edits.       We believe this
was due to users focusing on only one type of collaborative action (editing), and each user tried to contribute
equally to the group project, so users each had to perform similar numbers of edits.       On the other hand, in the
Spring 2012 semester when users exploited the Web 2.0 features, we observe that editing behavior shifted to
where only a few users made the majority of the edits to the groups' reports, whereas other users contributed
instead through the additional Web 2.0 features.  Thus, it appears that the use of Web 2.0 features caused role
diversification within the groups, where users contributed in different ways.      For example, some users tagged
keywords to summarize the report and organize it within the context of the other pages in the wiki, some users
actively discussed page content through comments, and others carried out designated edits.         Moreover, other
users contributed more to the class in general by rating many pages within the wiki, rather than contributing to
their group's page.  Therefore, adding additional Web 2.0 features achieved our goal of increasing opportunities
for participation by different users, which led to greater overall participation by users.
         Furthermore, the increased diversification of collaboration in the Spring 2012 semester also resulted in
higher quality collaboration than the less diverse Fall 2011 semester. Table 2 shows that the grades earned for
the group reports were much higher in Spring 2012 than in Fall 2011.        Additionally, the standard deviation in
student grades was also much smaller in Spring 2012, indicating that the quality of reports was consistently bet-
ter in Spring 2012.  Therefore, the increased use of the Web 2.0   features resulted in not only more active  collab-
orative activity amongst users, but also higher quality collaboration, thus benefiting the wiki system and users.

Use and Effect of Intelligent Features
Next, we analyze the use of intelligent features by users only during the Spring 2012 semester (since these fea-
tures were not available during Fall 2011).  These features encourage the user to explore the other pages within
the wiki by either directly recommending such pages or indirectly helping the user find related pages by organ-
izing pages with similar keywords.    To evaluate the impact of these effects, we present per user the number of

        First, usage of this intelligent feature did not follow quite the same trend as the Web 2.0 features in Fall
2011. Specifically, despite the fact that in both cases the use of these features was not required, we observe that
a larger number of users exploited the recommendations made by the system in Spring 2012 than used the Web
2.0 features in Fall 2011, and users did so more frequently as well.  This result indicates that impactful, sus-
tained use might be easier to achieve for intelligent rather than Web 2.0 features. Furthermore, such use could
be enhanced through increased awareness of these features.     Particularly, recommendations were made in an
unobtrusive side panel located near the bottom of a page; with better visibility, this feature could become more
useful to more users, similar to the effect we observed for required Web 2.0 feature usage.
        Additionally, we observe that the inclusion of intelligent features positively affected the total viewing
behavior of users. Most importantly, we note that the least active users (in the tails of the viewing distributions)
viewed a higher number of page views in the Spring 2012 semester that included the intelligent features.      This
implies that including intelligent features encouraged users to more actively participate in the wiki-based activi-
ties by viewing more pages.  This result could be due to the system making it easier for users to explore the  col-
laborative knowledge stored within the wiki system, thereby lowering the costs of entry by the least active users.

Relationships Between Features
Finally, we analyze the relationships between the use of the different types of features and with the quality of
collaboration. We consider the correlations between activity counts from each feature type and the correlation

between activity counts and grades. These results are presented in Tables 3 (Fall 2011) and 4 (Spring 2012).
We highlight the results found to be statistically significant at the 0.01 and 0.05 significance levels.
         In Table 3 describing the Fall 2011 semester where few students made use of the Web 2.0 features, we
observe that a significant, positive correlation existed between the keyword tagging and page view and edit ac-
tions. Thus, the few students who used the advanced keyword tagging feature were active users within the wiki,
indicating that including this feature didn't boost participation by inactive users, but was instead an additional
way for active participants to collaborate. On the other hand, students who rated pages were also significantly
likely to leave comments, indicating that a second type of participants emerged:  students who offered feedback
on pages, but didn't contribute additional content to wiki pages. Unexpectedly, the students' grades were not
significantly correlated to any of the particular actions, indicating that even students who performed many ac-
tions (especially viewing and editing) did not necessarily achieve high grades for their reports, so the quantity
and quality of wiki-based activity were unrelated.  All other activities were not significantly correlated.
         In contrast, in Table 4 we observe additional significant, positive correlations for the Spring 2012 se-
mester.  First, usage of all of the Web 2.0 features was highly correlated. Thus, using some features might have
helped influence the use of others, which could be beneficial with assisting the system to reach "critical mass"
of their usage and boost overall participation. Second, usage of the Web 2.0 and intelligent features was also
highly correlated. That is, users were more likely to use any of the advanced features once they used one of
them.  Finally, we also observe several significant, positive correlations between user actions and their grades.
This indicates that, unlike in the Fall 2011 semester, users who performed larger quantities of collaboration
were also likely to achieve higher quality collaboration. Therefore, we have more evidence that increased par-
ticipation through the inclusion of Web 2.0 and intelligent features led to better collaboration between users.

Discussion
Based on these results, we finally evaluate our proposed hypotheses for our research study and begin to answer
our research questions. First, we found support for hypothesis H3 because we observed that the inclusion of
intelligent features led to an increase in the number of pages viewed by both the most and least active users in
the system. Thus, recommending  related pages and    organizing pages by extracted keywords from the       page con-
tent led users to explore the shared collaborative knowledge stored within the wiki, (1) boosting participation by
less active users, and (2) potentially improving the individual knowledge of users after reading those pages.
         Second, we found evidence both in favor of and opposing hypotheses H1, H2, and H4.              We observed
that simply including Web 2.0 features did not result in their usage (in Fall 2011), and thereby did not affect
collaboration. However, once usage was encouraged through minimum requirements (in Spring 2012), not only
were the features used more frequently, but their usage often exceeded the requirements.        This led to (1) in-
creased amounts of collaboration between users, supporting H1, (2) a diversification of roles in the collaboration
process, supporting H2, and (3) increased quality of collaboration through higher grades earned, supporting H4.
   Overall, with respect to studying wiki-based CSCL, we draw the following primary conclusion:
         Including advanced (e.g., Web 2.0 and intelligent) features to support and promote active
         participation and collaboration amongst student users of wiki-based systems is valuable
         and can lead to higher quality collaboration, but must be appropriately encouraged.
Specifically, such encouragement does not simply mean imposing minimum requirements for collaboration as
in our study and considered elsewhere in the literature (e.g., Ebner et. al, 2008). Instead, such encouragement
could possibly arise through improved interface design, such as better highlighting the existence and benefit of

such features. Moreover, increased education of the use of the interface could also encourage more advanced
feature usage. Our users were simply assigned their projects with little to no education in the usage of the wiki
tool or more than a brief introductory text explaining its features. Finally, periodic pop-ups or other encour-
agement from the system itself could also lead to increased usage of advanced features and the resulting benefits
of more active collaboration. This last approach has been effective in other collaborative systems to encourage
users to participate (Wash & Lampe, 2012).   In the future, we plan to study these potential methods of encour-
aging users to participate in order to promote more active and effective collaboration amongst users and reach a
"critical mass" where sustained active collaboration benefits both the system and its users. We also intend to
add surveys and possibly interviews to our data collection (1) to better understand the interplay between student
knowledge, technology experience, and motivation with our advanced software features and (2) more precisely
measure increases in student learning (e.g., assimilation and accommodation, Cress and Kimmerle, 2008).
