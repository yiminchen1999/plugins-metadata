         Abstract: This study investigated relationships between how students "listen" (access existing
         posts) and    "speak"   (contribute  posts)   in asynchronous   online   discussions.   Ten  variables
         indexing  four   dimensions     of students'  listening   (breadth, depth,  temporal   contiguity and
         revisitation)    and   five   variables   indexing    three  dimensions     of   students'   speaking
         (discursiveness, depth of content and reflectivity) were calculated for 31 students participating
         in six week-long      online  discussions  as  part  of an  undergraduate      educational psychology
         course. Multi-level mixed-model linear regressions indicated that responsiveness of students'
         posts was positively predicted by how often they revisited previously read peer posts, and
         negatively related to a greater number of posts in the discussion overall. Post content quality
         was predicted by the percentage of posts viewed that students actually read (as opposed to
         scan). Put together, results suggest that when students take the time to read and re-read their
         peers' posts there are related benefits in the quality of the posts they contribute.

Introduction
Asynchronous    discussions     are often   seen as  a  powerful   venue for    knowledge    construction  due   to their
affordances for thoughtful commentary and reflective responses (Lipponen, 2002). The core premise is that
learners build  their  ideas  collectively  and  individually  through dialogue;    thus  well-designed  and  supported
online discussions can contribute to learning. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain such learning
including articulating one's ideas, receiving feedback on these, socio-cognitive conflict caused by exposure to
divergent views,   the   taking of   multiple perspectives    into account,  and    the internalization of collaborative
activity (Stahl 2005; Lipponen, 2002). In common, all depend on two basic interrelated processes that learners
must engage in: "speaking" (contributing posts to the discussion); and "listening" (accessing existing posts)
[Wise et al., 2013]. When learning discussions are truly collaborative, these two activities are intimately related
and inform each other. In contrast, if learners do not attend to others' posts (or do so in an incoherent way) the
"discussion" that results is more akin to a series of parallel monologues, explaining the findings of shallow and
disjointed conversations noted by various researchers (e.g. Thomas, 2002; Webb et al 2004).
         Previous research has informed our understanding about the ways in which learners engage in the
activities of speaking and listening in online discussions (e.g. Pena-Shaff & Nicholls, 2004; Hewitt, 2003; Ho &
Swan,  2007;   Wise    et al.,  2013)  but   heretofore   not  connected    the two.    This is important  because   the
interrelationship (or lack thereof) between the activities of speaking and listening may be an important factor
contributing to the extent to which asynchronous discussions live up to or fall short of their possibilities for
supporting knowledge construction. In this study we bridge this gap by examining how students' listening and
speaking behaviors relate to each other. This work connects to the conference theme of learning across levels as
the interdependent processes of individuals within the context of groups are examined over time.

Theoretical Framework
While the metaphorical language of speaking and listening refers to real-time spoken conversations; in online
discussions these activities take a different form. In "listening" learners engage with the text-based expressions
of others' ideas at their discretion and on their own timeline (Jonassen & Kwon, 2001); in "speaking" they
exercise  decisive control     over  the  timeline  for   composing   their  thoughts,   and  when   and   where in  the
conversation they contribute. This temporal flexibility and decoupling of participation timelines changes the
dynamics of discussions, allowing time for reflection and the opportunity to revisit comments already "heard,"
but also creating challenges for managing discussions that proliferate in one's absence (Lipponen, 2002; Peters
& Hewitt, 2010). New categories with which to characterize these behaviors also emerge.

Conceptualizing Dimensions of "Listening" in Online Discussions
Previous work (Wise et al., 2012a; 2012c; 2013) has conceptualized different dimensions to characterize the
ways in which students attend to the posts of others and has explored different approaches students take in such
online listening. At   a  basic level, students  can   differ in the breadth    and depth  with  which  they view   their
classmate's contributions. The breadth with which students attend to others' posts is important in terms of the
diversity of ideas that they are exposed to and their ability to respond to the discussion as a whole, while the
depth with which they attend to these posts is an indication of the degree to which they are considering others'

ideas. For example some students "cover" the conversation by opening a large percentage of their classmate's
posts but spending little time on them, while others attend to only a portion of discussion posts but focus on
them  deeply   (Wise  et al.,  2012a).  Because   students are  in  control   of their  own   timelines  of participation
(Jonassen & Kwon, 2001) it is also necessary to consider the temporal contiguity of students' listening; for
example the degree to which they disperse or concentrate their participation. Finally, online discussions permit
revisitation activities in which students can choose to return to posts (made by themselves and others) that they
have attended to previously. Students' bias towards reading new posts (Hewitt, 2003), however, may limit the
frequency with which such revisitation actually occurs. Generally richer listening behaviors along each of these
dimensions (greater breadth, depth, contiguity and revisitation) are thought to be more desirable for interactive
dialogue in online discussions; however, such connections need to be examined empirically. To theorize and test
potential relationships  with    specificity we   must   first conceptualize     qualities of  speaking   along   several
dimensions as well.

Conceptualizing Aspects of "Speaking" Quality in Online Discussions
The different characteristics, functions and qualities of posts in online discussions have been theorized by many
researchers (for a selected overview see reviews by De Wever et al, 2006 and Hew et al., 2010). Examined
together, three common dimensions can be seen as important in almost all models: discursiveness (that learners'
comments   refer to   each    other in  meaningful   ways);    content  (that the  learning    material  is thoughtfully
considered); and reflectivity (that the learning process itself is taken as an object for examination). Each of these
dimensions is expanded on below.
          First, for discussions to function as interactive dialogues rather than a series of parallel monologues
(Boulos & Wheeler, 2007), posts need to contain discursive elements through which participants link their
comments   to  each   other.  These  elements   can  be responsive    (e.g. expressions    of social support, proposing
consensus) or elicitative (e.g. asking questions). Responsiveness itself can take many forms; at a basic level a
simple act such as acknowledging others may create the social support required for individuals to build trust to
take risks within a discussion (Cheung et al., 2008). At a deeper level, when students respond to the ideas in a
post they may expand or challenge that student's (and others') existing thinking, and when they respond to
multiple ideas synthetically they can initiate a process of developing collective understanding (Gunawardena, et
al., 1997). Similarly by eliciting responses from others, students contribute to the interactivity of the dialogue.
          In addition to discursiveness, the depth with which academic content is discussed is central to the
learning. A common way to assess this across multiple discussion topics draws on the argumentation literature
and looks at the degree to which students make claims, and use reasoning, evidence, and theory to support them
(e.g. Lin et al. 2012; Weinberger & Fischer, 2006). The underlying notion is that richer argumentation structures
(more  content-related   claims    and  the  greater use   of  supporting    evidence,    and  theory)   indicate deeper
consideration of the learning material. Finally, the opportunity for reflectivity has been cited as a particular
advantage of asynchronous online discussion since time-unlimited review of earlier parts of the discussion is
possible (Harasim, 2000; Knowlton, 2005). Within a discussion, a student may consider the process of the
group's knowledge construction (Knowlton, 2005), but also the development of their own ideas on a topic. Thus
target of reflection may be the learning process at either the group or individual level.
          Put together, these five elements (responsiveness, elicitation, argumentation, individual reflection, and
group reflection) across three dimensions (discursiveness, content, and reflectivity) provide a useful framework
with which   to examine      the contributions  a post  makes   to  a  discussion.  In   the  next section  we  describe
theoretically predicted relationships between these aspects of speaking quality and the dimensions of listening
described above.

Connecting Speaking and Listening Activity
Theoretically,  speaking  and    listening  are intimately  interrelated    activities in  the process   of constructing
knowledge though online discussions; however such connections have not yet been examined empirically. In
this section we explicate the logic by which we would conceptually expect them to relate using the dimensions
of speaking and listening outlined previously. Considering breadth of listening, as students attended to a greater
proportion  of  their peer's    posts, we   would expect   them    to be more    discursive    in their own   comments,
responding  to  and   eliciting  ideas  from them.   In addition   as  they  become    aware   of  a greater  number  of
perspectives and views on the discussion topic, they are also likely to create posts with more sophisticated
argumentation that supports, and perhaps qualifies, their position with respect to these other views. Depth of
listening would also be expected to support discursiveness and argumentation as a richer understanding of
peers' ideas would support more thoughtful responses and questions, as well as lead to richer content as students
carefully support or qualify their ideas based on this understanding. Turning to revisitation, rereading of already
viewed peer   posts   suggests   additional consideration  of  the ideas contributed    by   others, and thus would   be
expected to further support discursiveness and argumentation in the ways described above. Returning to ideas
considered (or contributed) previously also can support the process of reflection on both group and individual

learning processes. Temporal dispersion may also support reflection; if students distribute their participation
over a greater period of time and number of sessions they may be more likely to notice changes in their own and
others' views. In contrast the temporal contiguity of conducting listening and speaking actions in the same
session may be needed as a foundation for relationships between the two activities to be established.

Research Questions
1.  What listening behaviors are associated with the discursiveness of a student's post in terms of
    responsiveness and elicitation?
2.  What listening behaviors are associated with the depth of content of a student's post in terms of
    argumentation?
3.  What listening behaviors are associated with the reflectivity of a student's post in terms of individual and
    group reflection?

Methods

Learning Environment and Participants
Students in a fully online undergraduate course on educational psychology participated in six week-long small-
group discussions with 8-10 classmates. Discussions were conducted in three two-week sets (weeks 3/4, 8/9 and
11/12); the instructor gave students both group and individual feedback after the first two discussions (worth 5%
of the course grade) and the latter four (worth 20%). Each week, students were asked to discuss contrasting
perspectives on an authentic educational controversy and come to a collective position with rationale. Students
were required to contribute at least two posts per topic and given guidelines for expectations of post quality in
line with the dimensions of discursiveness, content, and reflectivity discussed above. Thirty-one of 52 students
enrolled in the course consented to have data on their discussion participation collected for this study.

Data Extraction and Variable Calculations

Listening Variables
Clickstream (log-file) data was collected on all actions students took in the system to assess listening activity;
action types were "view" (opening others' posts), "post" (creating a post), or "review" (revisiting previously
read posts). Times between subsequent actions were subtracted to calculate duration, actions were divided into
sessions-of-use, and views were subcategorized as scans or reads based on a maximum reading speed of 6.5
words per second  (wps)   [see Hewitt et  al., 2007]. Ten variables were  calculated  for the different    listening
dimensions (see Table 1).

Speaking Variables
All 479 posts made by participants were extracted from the discussion tool and coded by two researchers for the
five speaking variables (along three dimensions) described previously to evaluate post quality. The post was
used as the unit of analysis for both theoretical and practical reasons as this was the unit through which students
expressed their ideas in interaction with others and it presented an unambiguous basis for segmentation. The
discursive dimension was assessed though the degree of students' Responsiveness to others' posts [ = 0.71]
and Elicitation that invited responses from others [ = 0.91] to capture the degree to which a posts attempted to
connect  to  preceding  and  subsequent    discussion. The  content   dimension  was  assessed   as  richness   of
Argumentation [ = 0.74], which captures the depth with which the academic content was considered. Finally
the reflectivity dimension was evaluated through the degree to which students exhibited Reflection on their
Individual Learning Process [ = 0.83] and Reflection on the Group's Learning Process [ = 0.75] to assess the
degree to which students considered the process of knowledge construction either as an individual or for the
group.  Coding was based on a combination and adaptation of prior schemes and models by Hara et al. (2000),
Knowlton (2005), Pena-Shaff & Nicholls (2004), Weinberger & Fischer (2006), and Wise et al. (2012d); see
Table 2 for an overview of the scheme used.

Statistical Analysis
Multi-level mixed-model linear regressions for each speaking variable on predicted relevant listening variables
were conducted to examine relationships. Because students' discussion behaviors may change across a series of
discussions, aggregating   data across the entire semester could obscure   relationships between    listening  and
speaking behaviors. Thus, models were based on variable averages calculated for each discussion week, the unit
of activity in the course. For each model, the explanatory variables of interest were included as fixed effects (see
Table 3) while effects of group-membership, discussion-week, group-by-week interactions (operationalized as #
of posts per group), students-nested-within-groups and student-by-week interactions (operationalized as # of
posts per student) were included as random effects. Backwards elimination was used to iteratively remove
explanatory variables and refit equations until all remaining variables had p < .10. The two post-count variables
remained in the model regardless of their significance. The alpha level used for interpretation was .05.

Results

Summary Statistics
There was great diversity in listening and speaking behaviors in the discussions. Although all students logged in
the forum at least once each discussion set, some engaged in minimal participation with no posting and little
attention to the posts of others, while others logged-in multiple times and read every post in the discussion (see
Table 4). The number of posts in each discussion ranged from 13 to 52. The average level of responsiveness was
at the mid-point  of the   scale, while elicitation was  low and  argumentation   was  high,  though     all varied
substantially. Reflection on both individual learning and group processes was consistently low.

Multi-level Regressions
Modeling results indicated that the responsiveness of students' posts was related both to the number of reviews
of other students' posts and the total number of posts made by the group in a particular discussion week.
Number of reviews of other students' posts was a positive predictor (greater reviewing of others' posts in a
discussion week was associated with the making of more responsive posts) while the total number of posts made
by the group was a negative predictor (a greater number of posts made by a group in a week was associated with
lower average responsiveness in group members' posts). The level of elicitation in students' posts was also
predicted by the number of reviews of other students' posts; however in this case the relationship was negative
(more elicitative posts by a student in a discussion week was associated with less reviewing of others' posts).
Richness of argumentation was predicted only by the percentage of posts viewed that students actually read (as
opposed to scanned). This relationship was positive (a greater percentage of reading in a discussion week was
associated with richer argumentation in the posts made). Neither individual nor group reflection was predicted
by any of the listening variables.

Discussion
The major finding of this study is the relationship between listening (in terms of depth and revisitation of others
posts) and  quality of speaking    (in terms of discursiveness and argumentative quality). While a connection
between listening behaviors and speaking quality has been proposed theoretically (Wise et al., 2012a; 2013) and
is implicit in much research on online discussions, this is the first work we are aware of that provides direct
empirical evidence to support the connection. Below we discuss the specific relationships found, contextualizing
them in the larger framework of prior research on online discussions.
         Discursiveness is an important dimension of speaking in online discussions because it is what links
individual comments together as a dialogue. Responsiveness can vary from simply social acknowledgements to
building on or challenging individual ideas to synthetically integrating multiple perspectives (Gunawardena et
al., 1997). The positive relationship found between revisiting others' posts and responsiveness suggests that the
richer end of this spectrum tends to occur when posts are attended to multiple times. Examples of such behavior
have been   found in previous research    on online discussion we  conducted using a microanalytic case-study
approach. In one study (Wise et al., 2012a) we found that a student characterized as interactive in her discussion
participation always spent substantial time reading and re-reading others' posts before making her own, highly
responsive, posts. In another extreme example (Wise et al., 2012c) a student who often built on others posts and
synthesized the group discussion always located her post as a reply to a post she had viewed at least three times
already.
         Put together, this research suggests an important role for reviewing previously read posts in effective
discussion participation. It is reasonable that students may need to read others' posts multiple times to make
sense of them in the context of the discussion before being able to respond to the ideas with a complex and
thoughtful response. However, prior research has documented students' tendency to do just the opposite; that is
focus on only new posts (Hewitt, 2003). Recent work that has attempted to address this problem of new post

CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                           Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

bias through the design of a discussion forum interface that encourages students to read and re-read posts in a
connected fashion (Marbouti, 2012) may thus prove particular valuable.
          In contrast  to  the positive relationship found   between   revisitation  and responsiveness,  a  negative
association was found between revisitation and elicitation. This can be interpreted in several different ways. It is
possible that rereading previously viewed peer posts helps students clarify some of the questions or doubts they
had when they viewed those posts the first time, leading them to ask fewer questions. However, elicitation
relates not only to clarification but also raising wonderings to the group. Thus another possible interpretation is
that when learners repeatedly set questions to the group, they were more likely to focus their energies on the
new responses to these, rather than posts they had read previously. Finally, it is important to note that overall
levels of elicitation in the discussions studied were low; thus it is possible that this finding is due to the actions
of a small sub-set of the population and of limited generalizability. This is clearly an area that requires further
investigation.
          The final relationship found for discursiveness was that responsiveness was negatively predicted by a
greater amount of posts in the overall discussion. This is consistent with previous findings that a large amount of
posts in a discussion lead students to feel overwhelmed (Peters & Hewitt, 2010) and suggests that it may be
beneficial to make groups small, thus keeping discussions at a manageable size which allows students to be
responsive as part of an interactive dialogue.
          Considering argumentation, previous work has questioned whether it is breadth of listening, depth of
listening, or a combination of the two that is important to support the richness of post content (Wise et al.,
2013). The   finding   here of a  relationship   between the percent  of  posts read (not scanned)   and richness   of
argumentation     clearly indicates depth  as  the more   relevant   dimension. This  aligns   with the finding  of a
relationship between rich responsiveness and post revisitation since returning to a previously viewed post to
consider it again could be considered as deep listening in conceptual sense. Logically it makes sense that deep
attention to peers' posts can support a richer understanding of meaning and thus stronger argumentation as this
understanding drives students to consider and support or qualify their own ideas more deeply. This may help
explain part of the mechanism by which conscientious design of online discussion forums can encourage rich
argumentation (Lin et al, 2012). In combination with the lack of findings for listening breadth it also provides
empirical  evidence    to support our  previous  assertion that listening deeply  to some  of   a discussion may    be
preferable to listening shallowly to all of it (Wise et al., 2013).
          Unfortunately, here again research shows us that students tend to do the opposite of what is beneficial,
focusing on breadth rather than depth. For example in one of the prior set of cases studies mentioned above, we
found evidence of two students who viewed almost all the posts in their discussion, but without drawing on their
ideas in their own posts (Wise et al., 2012a). On deeper inspection it seemed that their purpose for viewing posts
differed, for one student it appeared to be an effort to "cover" the discussion content, while for the other it was
to be able to acknowledge others' posts in a social manner. Additionally, in a larger cluster analysis of student
listening behaviors    we  found  that the apparent  difference in   breadth between  two  clusters  of students was
somewhat dissipated by a follow-up analysis revealing that while the "broad" listeners did view all the posts,
they spent the majority of their listening efforts in concentrated activity examining a smaller number of posts in
depth  (Wise   et al., 2013).  These   findings, along with  others  indicating that students  often use widespread
scanning as a strategy for coping with high-volume discussions (Wise et al., 2012b; Peters & Hewitt 2010),
suggest that students do not instinctively know how to listen effectively in online discussion, and that it is
important to provide them with explicit instruction about how to do so.

Conclusion and Study Significance
This  study  provides   empirical   evidence  to  support  a relationship between    listening behaviors (depth  and
revisitation) and quality of speaking (discursiveness and depth of content) in online discussions. This is an
important area for research because speaking and listening are two interrelated aspects of participating in an
online discussion, but previous research has not examined this connection. As shown in this study, patterns in
listening can help explain and predict patterns in speaking. Specifically, when students take the time to read and
re-read some number of their peers' posts, there are related benefits in the quality of the posts they contribute.
The connection between these listening behaviors and post qualities is particularly important given past studies
suggesting weak student listening behaviors (Thomas, 2002) and tendencies to focus on reading only new posts
or using scanning as a strategy for coping with high-volume discussions (Wise et al., 2012b; Peters & Hewitt
2010). In addition, while the bulk of guidance for students' participation in online discussions focuses on how
to post, understanding what listening behaviors are associated with what speaking ones suggests new ways to
support students in effective discussion participation. Future work will test the efficacy of providing students
with listening guidance to support their speaking quality and expand this work to examine listening/speaking
relationships in other kinds of discussion contexts.
