         Abstract: With respect to the Script Theory of Guidance (SToG), four open questions of
         importance      are  identified  regarding  the   optimal scripting   level  principle. This     principle
         concerns mainly the interaction between internal and external scripts as well as the effect of
         this interaction on knowledge acquisition. In an experimental study with N = 96 participants
         (who learned in groups of three), we examined the effects of external scripting and fading on
         the development of an internal script and analyzed the role of the individual's initial internal
         script.   The  results are  in  line with  the principles of the   SToG   so  that the  external   script
         facilitated the internal script mediated by the application during the collaborative learning. In
         addition, the initial internal scripts interact positively with the external script regarding the
         effect on the development of individual's internal scripts.

Collaboration scripts have been used to scaffold various computer-mediated collaborations through a sequence
of interaction phases with designated activities and roles (Kollar, Fischer, & Hesse, 2006), with the purpose of
helping learners to engage in productive interaction and collaborative knowledge construction (Fischer et al.,
2013), such     as  the construction   of arguments.   Through  argumentation,     students  learned   to  think  critically,
articulate their own views, and negotiate their own thoughts with others' different perspectives. Despite much
progress, the findings have been mixed with respect to the effects of structured instructional supports for groups
(e.g., Stegmann, Weinberger, & Fischer, 2007) to foster argumentative knowledge construction. Hence, there
are questions that deserve further investigation to understand the underlying principles associated with effective
collaboration scripts. Recently, Fischer and colleagues (2013) outlined a Script Theory of Guidance that take a
systematic view of central components that are shared among different scaffolding approaches and several
leading principles to explain a broad range of findings from the CSCL literature.
         The script theory of guidance describes how the learners' knowledge on collaboration can be described
in terms of internal collaboration script components and how these internal collaboration script components
guide  learners    in understanding    of and  acting  in  CSCL  practices.  Participation  in   these practices,   in turn,
facilitates the  development    of  these  hierarchically  organized  internal collaboration     scripts. Four  conceptual
components      were   identified:  The   Play component    constitutes general    knowledge     about    the collaborative
situation at the top level. The Scene components include knowledge about a specific situation in a play and the
Scriptlet component refers to knowledge of activities and their sequence(s) in a particular scene. Finally, the
Role components typically extend across several scenes and activities, which thereby constitute knowledge of
how the activities are distributed during a scene within a group. The external collaboration script consists of
scaffolds targeting at supporting the learner to employ internal collaboration script components that would not
have been used spontaneously.
         In addition, seven guiding principles were outlined in the Script Theory of Guidance (Fischer et al.,
2013).One of the principles emphasizes the importance of being `optimal' in regards to the degree of external
collaboration   scripts  that   are put   into use   (Optimal  External    Scripting   Level Principle):      "An   external
collaboration   script  is most    effective  for knowledge    acquisition  if it  is directed   at the   highest   possible
hierarchical level of internal collaboration script components for which subordinate components are already
available to the learner." However, striking the balance between too little scaffolding to be helpful and too much
scaffolding  to    allow  for group    interactions is  indeed a   delicate  issue   (Dillenbourg,   2002).   Against   this
background,     the question  arises of   how  to  further conceptualize  and  manipulate    the  vague   meaning    of the
`optimal' level of scripting. The highlighted dynamic nature of scripting       is based on the intrinsic component of
the scaffolding system called `internalization'. Accordingly, the specificity of the external script would need to
gradually be reduced to ensure that learners are not given instruction they actually do not need ­ a process of
reducing    the amount   of   external  instruction  is known   as  fading  (Pea,  2004).   Despite  the   fact that   SToG
postulates that internal and external scripts need to be optimally combined to facilitate knowledge acquisition
most effectively,,the theory does not explicitly specify the role of fading for acquisition of internal scripts. A
close-up analysis of how do external scripting and fading affect the internalization of collaboration scripts,
therefore deserve further investigation through controlled experimental studies.
         The Transactivity Principle outlined in the Script Theory of Guidance states that the acquisition of
knowledge is positively associated with the amount of the transactive application through participation in a
given CSCL practices: "The more a given CSCL practice requires the transactive application of knowledge, the

better this knowledge is learned through participation in this CSCL practice." (Fischer et al., 2013, p. 58) While
several  empirical  studies on  the effects  of  external  collaboration   scripts from CSCL     research   show  the
effectiveness of external collaboration scripts regarding their positive effects on collaborative learning processes
(Stegmann et al., 2007), past efforts did not lead to a unique and integrated model of the effects of collaboration
scripts on  the learning processes  as  well  as outcomes.    There  still remains  little research  which   provided
empirical  evidences for  exploring    the underlying  relationships  between  the   repeated   application  of script
components and the assumed individual development of internal collaboration scripts.
         From the perspectives of SToG, both of the internal and external collaboration play essential roles in
guiding learner to understand and act in CSCL practices. On the one hand, "when participating in a CSCL
practice, the learner's understanding of and acting in this situation is guided by dynamically configured and re-
configured internal collaboration scripts." (Internal Script Guidance Principle), and on the other hand, "external
collaboration scripts enable learners to engage in an instance of a CSCL practice at a level beyond what they
would   be able to  without  an external   collaboration  script." (External Script  Guidance    Principle). Shortly,
external collaboration  scripts can  create  opportunities,  but   whether learners  benefit from   the  instructional
supports depends on the dynamic interplay between internal factors and external instructions. Kollar (2007)
reported that the success of collaborative learning is also affected by learners' internal collaboration scripts that
guides them in collaborative settings. While researchers have adopted the importance of internal collaboration
scripts largely for theoretical reasons, surprisingly little direct empirical evidence exists to actually verify these
assumptions. The current work both divers and builds upon the previous study, rather than providing polarized
treatments, either with or without collaboration scripts we explore the interplay between internal and external
scripts when various degrees of scripting are manipulated.
Research questions
The purpose of this study is to build in-depth understanding of the effects of an external script on the acquisition
of an internal script and analyzed the role of the individual's initial internal script. A set of research questions
was formulated to address the interactive relationships between internal and external collaboration scripts.
         RQ  1:  To  what    extent does   external  scripting  and  fading  affect  application  of internal   script
components during collaborative learning?
         RQ 2: To what extent does external scripting and fading affect the development of an internal script?
         RQ 3: To what extent is the positive effect of external scripting and fading on the development of an
internal script mediated by the application of internal script components during collaborative learning?
         RQ 4: To what extent is the positive effect external scripting and fading have on the development of
internal script moderated by the initial internal script?
Methods
Ninety-six (N = 96) students at the University of Munich participated in this study during the summer term 2010.
The collaborative learning task of the participants was to apply the Attribution Theory to five problem cases
through argumentation and propose a final analysis for each case. A one-factorial experimental design with
three conditions was implemented. The time on task, all together 80 minutes, was held constant for the three
conditions. During  the  entire learning   process, individuals  were randomly     assigned  to groups   of three and
further to one of the three experimental conditions. In order to address the complex problem of `over-scripting',
a rather detailed external collaboration scripts in the High Degree of Scripting (HD) condition was developed (at
the bottom level of Scriptlets targeting the specific activities). For instance, written prompts were delivered
according to a simplified version of Toulmin's model (1958) to guild the constructions of claim (i.e., a statement
that advances the position learners take to analyze case with attribution theory), ground (i.e., evidence from case
to support  claim), or  warrant  (i.e. logical  connections   between  the   grounds  and   claims  that present  the
theoretical reason why a claim is valid). The Medium Degree of Scripting (MD) was implemented through
continuous fading-out of the prompts of the external script. The environment handles the fading levels according
to a designed sequence with a fixed time interval specified by the researchers in advance. For example, in the
end of the tenth phase, learners received only one textbox for creating a whole argumentation (Scene) instead of
specifying the argument components (Scriptlets). Participants in the condition with Low Degree of Scripting
(LD) received no additional support in solving the problem cases.
         As the main data sources, all messages that learners put forward in the text-based communication were
divided into units of analysis -- syntactically meaningful sentences and subsequently coded on argumentation
dimension, which reflects different desired activities to build formally complete arguments . Each segment was
coded whether it was a claim, a ground, or a warrant. The SIDE tools (Mayfield & Rosé, 2010) for automatic
classification were used for segmentation and coding. The inter-rater reliability was sufficiently high (Cohen's
Kappa between human coders and SIDE above .7 (Mu, Stegmann, Mayfield, Rosé, & Fischer, 2012). Content
analyses on the argumentation dimension as described above have been applied to the pre-test case to assess the
baseline Initial Internal Scripts (IS), the Application of Internal Scripts (IS) measured the average quality of
argumentation as a trio-group on the same dimension but during the collaborative learning process of analyzing

three problem cases, as well as the Development of Internal Scripts (IS) assessed in the post/transfer case as the
one of the indicators of internalized collaboration scripts.
          Standard linear regression analysis and a set of two-level Hierarchical Linear Model models with the
use of the software HLM 6.08 for windows was performed to analyze the clustered data collected in the present
study. Through two dummy codes, namely Scripting (LD = 0, MD = 0, HD = 1) and Fading (LD = 0, MD = 1,
HD = 0) the categorical variables of the experimental treatments can be rendered into quantitative forms.
Results
RQ  1:    To  what   extent  does     external  scripting and   fading    affect  application  of     IS components      during
collaborative learning? The regression model using the predictors Scripting and Fading explained about 33% of
the variance of the application of internal scripts (R2 = .33, F(2, 29) = 7.09, p < .01). Both of the predictors had
significant  positive effects     on the  application of  IS (scripting = .62, p  < .01;  fading =  .54,  p  =  .01). Learners
supported by scripts, either with high or medium degree did apply more collaboration scripts during online
discussion compared with groups in the control condition. We did not find any significant difference between
the groups with HD of scripting and MD of scripting ( = .08, p > .50).
          RQ  2:  To  what   extent   does  external  scripting  and    fading affect  the   development     of IS?   For  each
outcome variable, the HLM analyses were performed in four stages. At the first stage, a null model was tested in
which no independent variable was included. By adding the group-level intervention variables                       the second
model was to address the effects of various degrees of scripting on learning outcomes.

          As shown in Table 1, the variance of the group level residual errors are estimated as 0.17, which is
small but significantly different from zero (2 = 66.23, df = 31, p < .01). By calculating intra-class correlation,
26% of the variances of the development of IS exist at the group level. The regression coefficient for Scripting
is significant which means that on average students receiving external scripts with HD contribute 0.57 (p < .05)
units  of analysis   more   than   students  in the  control condition.    However,   no   significant   difference   is found
between other treatment groups. The deviances reported here as -2*log likelihood function value reduced from
the null model 223.47 to the full model 217.13 with a significant difference (2 = 6.34, df = 2, p < .05), which
indicates  a  better model-fit    has  been   achieved   by  adding the   variable  at the   group    level. Summarily,      the
empirical finding was against this initial assumption in which fading was expected to foster the internalization
of collaboration   scripts.  Learners    with  highly structured  external    scripts produced    more    formally    complete
arguments in the transferable post-case than learners in the other two conditions.
          RQ 3: To what extent is the positive effect external scripting and fading on the development of IS
mediated   by the    application   of  IS components     during  collaborative    learning?  The    last  two   models   are to
determine if the application of IS can account for the variation in the slopes after controlling for the effects of
various interventions. As shown in the third model, the coefficient associated with the relation between the
dummy     variable   Scripting    and development     of  IS  is significant   (Scripting =  .55,   p <  .05).  When     further
controlling the application of IS, it was significantly associated with the corresponding learning outcomes (
= .70, p < .05). The coefficient for the mediated effect dropped down from significant to insignificant Scripting
= .16 (p > .05). The addition of learning process as a predictor yield substantially increased variances which can
be explained at the group level, namely from 40% to 70%. The Sobel test indicates that the application of IS
mediated the relationship between external scripting and development of IS (p = .01). Meanwhile, the difference
between the model deviances (2 = 9.20, df = 1, p < .01) demonstrates a better model fit.
          RQ 4: To what extent is the positive effect external scripting and fading on the development of an
internal script moderated by the learner´s initial internal script? The regression coefficient for the cross-level
interaction is 1.47 (p < .05) by multiplying the dummy coding variable Scripting. The significant moderating
effect shown   that   learner   with  more   internal collaboration   scripts  performed     better than  learners    with less
internal collaboration scripts when they were all supported by HD of scripting. MD of scripting did not interplay
with internal collaboration scripts (Fading = .07, p > .05). R2 with predictors of degree of scripting and initial IS

excluding their interaction is close to zero at the individual level; inclusion of the interaction increase R2 to 0.11.
A better model fit was achieved (2 = 10.89, df = 3, p < .05).
Discussion
The major research questions of this study were to address to what extent does external scripting and fading of
an external script affect the application of internal script components during collaborative learning and the
development of an internal script (RQ1 & 2). The findings suggested that external scripting and fading facilitate
the application of internal scripts during collaborative learning, but the assumed negative effect of external
scripts with HD of scripting on the acquisition of IS (`over-scripting') did not occur. In addition the MD of
scripting manipulated with fading did not outperform as expected. To bridge the evidence gap in previous
studies by addressing the "optimal" degree scripting (Optimal External Scripting Level Principle), the current
study indicates that an absolute threshold (above which the scripting degree will be `too much' for all learners)
indeed does not exist. Rather, whether an external collaboration script being `too much' or not, is relative to and
depending on the available resource stored in the human mind as internal collaboration scripts (Internal &
External Script Guidance Principles). This study contributes to the growing empirical literature on the interplay
between the   internal and  external collaboration scripts  by   addressing to what    extent  is the  positive effect
external scripting and fading on the development of an internal script moderated by the learner´s initial internal
script (RQ 4). It is surprising that more experiences learner with more internal collaboration scripts benefited
most of the full and   continuous collaboration    scripts, rather  than from  the fading   condition.  In the  other
treatment conditions, namely low and medium degree of scripting, the influence of internal collaboration scripts
on argumentation vanished. Therefore, it might be explained that constructing a formally complete argument is
challenging for learners due to little `available' script components in minds, and thus the failure of fading might
be due to the removal of external scripts too quickly, which allows the scaffolding residing outside of learner's
ZPD and hence led to the unexpected effects. In addition, efforts are paid in the current study to elicit the nature
of the relationship between the application and the development of internal collaboration scripts simply differ
across external scripting (Transactivity Principle) by addressing to what extent is the positive effect external
scripting and fading on the development of internal script mediated by the application of script components
during collaborative learning (RQ 3). HD of scripting was found to strengthen the configuration/reconfiguration
of internal collaboration scripts due to the intensive practices on argumentation provided in the condition with
full and continuous instructional supports. The numerous studies on scientific argumentation have suggested
that for the overwhelming majority, the appropriate use of valid argument does not come naturally, but rather is
acquired through intensive practices (Kuhn, 1991). Thus learner might need more assistance and practice in
terms of HD of scripting to complete the challenging task and hence result in internalized collaboration scripts.
It can be also explained that the individual learners have been unable to benefit from fading, until experiencing a
longer practicing period than the 80 minutes of the collaborative learning phase during which they mastered the
relevant aspects of internal scripts. As another drawback of the current study, the learning environment handled
the fading procedure according to a predetermined and fixed time-interval which is not truly adaptive to what
happens during learning processes. This, thus, is subject to further examination the `appropriate' rates of fading
process that adapts to the learner's real-time performance in future research efforts.
