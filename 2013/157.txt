           Abstract:   Online discussion    is a popular   tool   for information   exchange     in  web-based
           education.  Analyses   of how    students  interact  or  their  contribution   styles can    help   us
           understand weaknesses or strengths of the participants.      This paper presents a framework for
           capturing information trading behaviors in Q&A discussions using a `reciprocity' model. We
           measure the reciprocity of a student based on (a) the degree of responses that he/she received
           from other  students in  discussing   his/her questions  and   (b) the degree  of   contributions   in
           discussing  other  students' problems.     We  use   a  linear  regression  to model     the overall
           reciprocity rate over time, and correlate the regression coefficient of the reciprocity rate to the
           student course grade. We found that although the overall reciprocity rate is not statistically
           correlated to the grade, high performing students have larger reciprocity rates and help other
           students  more  actively.  We   expect   that  the  reciprocity  rates revealed    from   discussion
           participations can help instructors make online activities more balanced.

Introduction
Reciprocity, as a general concept for measuring the "trade" in social exchange, contains the common sense that
giving and taking illuminate each other (Gouldner, 1960). As one of the essential and necessary attributes for
the social community (Wellman, 1999), reciprocity indicates the members' behavior in the community (Herring,
2001) and maintains the stable social system by encouraging the mutual beneficial exchanges and preventing
antisocial  behavior  (Alexander,   1987).  Online  learning  networks,    as an  aspect  of  social life, also yield  the
resource exchanges (Swan and Shea, 2005). Specifically, online discussion platform is a classical application of
learning networks, which supplies a platform for students to post problems they encounter during study as well
as to assist other students. Reciprocity allows the online discussion works effectively by promoting students to
`give' under certain circumstances and they can also obtain help when they have problems. In previous work,
reciprocity is treated as one of the "seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education" (Chickering,
1996).  In  addition,  reciprocity belongs  to  one   of the  major   motivating  factors that  promote    individuals  to
contribute to online communities (Wang, 2003).
   Although reciprocity requires giving and taking simultaneously, the degree of giving and taking for a group
or an individual cannot be strictly identical. There is a common recognition that giving can generate more
altruistic and   stable  reciprocity  while    taking yields   more   selfish  reciprocity.   Taking    into   account  of
characteristics of students, we classify them into three different groups: considerate, neutral and self-centered
groups. Given the assumption that human behavior varies based on selfishness, we compare reciprocity rates
among these three groups, which can provide insight on student knowledge sharing behavior (Soller, 2003). As
the degree of reciprocity in learning is hard to measure, we propose a simple but effective way to define the rate
between    the  degree  of giving  and  the degree    of taking   using participation  types   without  considering    the
inequality of each problem or question. We split the students into four different performance groups based on
their final course grades. Such classification can facilitate an analysis of how does the reciprocity rate vary
among different performance groups, allowing us to examine the relation between the grade and reciprocity.
   Furthermore, we examine the change of the reciprocity rate over time within the semester. Such reciprocity
trend, presenting     changes in   student  participation  styles,  can   assist  the  teacher   in  assessing    students'
contributions, comparing the performance of individuals or groups (Kapur, 2008), and detecting the cause for
the change in participation styles.

Methodology
In this section, we first describe how we process discussion data. We then present a model of reciprocity in
Q&A discussions. We show how the model captures the information trading behavior.
Data collection and processing
Our work takes place in an undergraduate course in Computer Science department at University of Southern
California. Student grades and online discussion data have been collected from the same course taught by the
same teacher in eight recent semesters, from 2006 to 2010 school year. The discussion data contain total 1,663
discussion threads and 7,164 messages. Among 370 active users, we chose 204 users who have at least two
questions,  so  that  we can  capture  the  information   trade trend  over   multiple questions.    Given   a thread, we
classify which user the thread belongs to, based on the user id of the initial message in the thread. The first
message in a thread usually presents a problem or a question that the user has (Feng et al., 2006). We can

estimate how much help a user obtains by counting how many responses he/she gets from other users. On the
other hand, we can also assess how much help the user provides to others by counting his/her replies to other
users' questions.
Reciprocity rate in Q&A discussions
We examine asynchronous online Q&A forums where participants trade information by posting questions and
sending answers   to the questions. Reciprocity is a common   activity   in social life but the  effectiveness      of
reciprocity in online education forums is not clearly observed (Edwards 2002; Halloran et al., 2002). One main
reason is that relations between actors in online learning communities are not very rich especially when there is
limited participation within a course. We use multiple (8) semesters' data from the same course to capture
general behavioral patterns.
     We define reciprocity rate (reciprocityR) as the ratio of giving and taking acts of a user. A user's message
is classified as a giving act of the person when it responds to a question. A response to the user's question is
counted as a taking act by the user. In computing the degrees of giving and taking ratio at a given time, we
accumulate all the giving and taking acts until that time. More specifically, the reciprocity of user i at time t
when he/she posts a question can be modeled as follows:

     where t is time at which user i posts a question. The overall reciprocity rate of the user within a semester
can  be computed     by accumulating  all the giving  and  taking   acts in  the semester.  We    used   min-max
normalization to rescale posting time ranges from the different semesters to the equal range between 0 and 1.
For example, if user i posts n questions, we can calculate n reciprocity rates for the user, which shows how the
rate change over   time as the user posts more  questions. Specifically,  k-th reciprocity  rate will be the rate
between accumulated giving and taking acts until k-th question. Once we have the reciprocity at each time point
for each user i, we can regress their reciprocity rates to capture the general trends on the time space as follows:

where   t is a value ranged between  0 and 1. In the fitted line,   is a slope called the regression coefficient.
Such behavior trend information can be related to other variables such as student performance.

Results

Reciprocity by Behavior and Group
Figure 1 shows the distribution of each user's reciprocityR over time by his/her behavior style and performance
group that he/she belongs. For performance-based grouping, we used normalized values of the course final
grades since the raw grades across semesters cannot be directly comparable. We split students into four grade
groups (high, high intermediate, low intermediate, and low grade group) using mean (0.82) and one standard
deviation (0.08).

                              Figure 1. Reciprocity Trends by grade and behavior.
     A user's responses can be split into two different types; responses in the discussions that he/she initiated
and responses in other users' threads. The former represents discussion participations in answering his/her own
question and the latter captures contributions to other people's problems. We use this to describe the user's
behavior style. A considerate user sends more replies to discuss other people's problems than his/her own

problems.  A   self-centered  user posts more   messages   relevant   to  his/her own   problems.  Other    users are
considered neutral.
    In  Figure  1, each  solid line represents  reciprocityR   of  a user  over  time. A  dotted  line  is called the
"reciprocal line" since its reciprocityR is 1, i.e. the number of giving acts is equal to the number of taking acts.
In the graphs in the top row (considerate group), we can observe that the reciprocitiRs of the high and the high-
intermediate groups increase while those of the low-intermediate and low groups decrease over time. That is,
higher performers tend to help other students. Although lower performers help other students sporadically, they
stop helping before the final exam, which is located close to 1 in the timeline. In the middle second row (neural
group), most lines are parallel to the reciprocity line but their reciprocitiyRs are close to zero. As shown in
Table 1, those students asked fewer questions than other behavior groups and the average length of discussion
threads is shorter than others. They seem to participate passively in the discussions resulting from the fact that;
the number of message received from others (taking acts) is relatively smaller than the number of message sent
to others (giving acts), as shown in Table 1.
    Finally, in the graphs in the bottom row (self-centered group), reciprocityRs in all the performance groups
increase  because  they  present more   giving acts  for their own   problems,   which  increases the  numerator    of
raciprocityRs. Interestingly, the self-centered behavior group among the low performing students has the largest
regression coefficient. They seem to concentrate on their own problems rather than others'.

Correlation Analysis between Reciprocity Trend and Grade
To investigate the relationship between reciprocity trends and grades, we generated a fitted line for each user
with his/her reciprocityR values. We used a linear regress analysis as shown in Figure 2. Each slope, which is a
regression coefficient (  ), represents reciprocityR trend for user i. As summarized in Table 1, high and high-
intermediate performing group have the largest average regression coefficient. The low-intermediate and the
low grade group have only negative average regression coefficients. In the graphs in the third row (self-centered
group), the average regression coefficients are positive because the number of giving acts for own problems
increase. Most  of  the  high  and low  performing   groups  are   either considerate  or self-centered while  high-
intermediate and low-intermediate group members are equally distributed among different behavior groups.

   Table 2 summarizes the result of a correlation analysis between regression coefficients and course grades.
As expected, overall, they are not statistically correlated to each other because regression rate changes of the
neutral and self-centered behavior groups are similar regardless of their grade levels. However, only for the
considerate behavior group, the regression coefficient is statistically and positively correlated to the course
grades, r(70) = 0.25, p<0.05.

Conclusion and Future Work
We propose a simple but effective model that captures reciprocal behaviors in student online Q&A discussions.
The  model  illustrates  different information  trading   patterns among    different  grade  groups.  We   utilize   a

"reciprocity line" to analyze the reciprocity trends of individual users. We found that although reciprocityR is
not statistically correlated with the course grade, high performing students tend to present higher reciprocity
rates.
   The participation styles may be related to the nature of the problem (Kapur 2007), such as difficulty and
well   structuredness.     Besides,  the   change  of    reciprocity  may    be  associated  with   the  emotion  the   student
(Muukkonen       2007).   We   plan  to  explore  use   of  reciprocity   in explaining  various   aspects  of  student   online
learning behavior.
