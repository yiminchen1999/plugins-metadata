         Abstract: Drawing on social cognitive theory, the study tested the effects of single-player
         versus multi-player simulations on self-efficacy and transfer of learning by psychometrically
         cumulating    25 years  of research with  a total sample  size of N=2,274.     Preliminary   results
         indicate   no  significant difference between     conditions. Implications    for  computer-based
         instructional design and directions for future research are discussed.

Introduction
Digital simulations can be defined as technology-based programs that contain a model of a system or a process
(De Jong & Van Joolingen, 1998). Digital simulations are becoming increasingly popular in adult education for
learning complex cognitive skills, largely because the similarity between natural phenomena and their simulated
representations promotes transfer of learning (Mayer et al., 2011). Some authors argue that this transfer is
further promoted through high levels of self-efficacy (Bandura, 2012; Gegenfurtner et al., 2013). However,
other authors argue that simulations, regardless if digital or face to face, need to be carefully designed before
they can be expected to promote self-efficacy and transfer (Garris et al., 2002; Knogler & Lewalter, in press).
Based on this discussion, it is yet unclear how social design contributes to regulating learners' levels of efficacy
beliefs and subsequent transfer of learning (Pineda et al., 2011).
         The present study intended to contribute to this discussion by meta-analyzing the available evidence
from the past 25 years. The aim was to cumulate previous research in order to correct the size of true score
population correlations between transfer and efficacy beliefs. A focus was on the contextual variation between
studies that offered   different shades   of computer-supported    individual   learning   (CSIL)    and collaborative
learning (CSCL), indicated by the number of players. Single-player simulations indicated individual learning (as
in Bell et al., 2008). Multi-player simulations indicated collaborative learning (as in Orvis et al., 2009).
         Based  on     social cognitive theory  (Bandura,   2012),   we  assumed    that    learners  in  multi-player
simulations, when    compared    with learners in  single-player   simulations, had higher    population   correlation
estimates between self-efficacy and transfer of learning, largely because multi-player simulations offer higher
degrees  of  social exchange    and  co-regulation processes while     engaging   with the   digital simulation tasks
(Bandura, 2012; Garris, 2002; Gegenfurtner et al., 2013; Tompson & Dass, 2002).

Method
Literature Searches and Inclusion Criteria
We performed a systematic review of the literature. To be included in the database, a study had to report an
effect size r or other effect sizes that could be converted to r (b coefficient; Cohen's d; F, t, or Z statistics).
Because the focus of inquiry was on task self-efficacy as an individual capacity (Bandura, 2012), the database
included studies that reported data on individuals. Studies reporting group-level data were omitted. We excluded
studies on computer self-efficacy, as the focus was on task-related self-efficacy. Studies on non-adult samples
were also excluded. We included studies that assessed transfer with objective performance measures while we
excluded studies that used self-ratings of transfer. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals over the last 25
years, from January 1986 to December 2011, were located in several ways. First, we searched the PsycINFO,
ERIC,   and  Web    of Science  databases using relevant   keywords.   Second,  we  cross-referenced     the  retrieved
articles as well as recent reviews and special issues on self-efficacy, transfer of learning, and simulation-based
training (Garris et al., 2002; Gegenfurtner, 2011; Segers & Gegenfurtner, 2013). A total of 15 journal articles
that contributed at least one effect size to the meta-analysis met all inclusion criteria.

Coding of Variables and Computation and Analysis of Effect Sizes
Three independent coders coded a randomly selected subset, 13.33% of the studies from the final sample.
Intercoder reliability was generally high (Cohen's  = .82). Uncertainty in codability was resolved through
collaborative discussions. Each study was coded for psychometric information and the social design element
(single-player vs.  multi-player).  Analysis  occurred in  two stages.  First,  a primary    meta-analysis   aimed to
estimate the true score population correlation  of the relationship between self-efficacy and transfer of learning.
Distributions of Pearson's r were corrected for sampling error and error of measurement using the compiled
Cronbach's  reliability estimates (). Second, a meta-analytic moderator analysis aimed to identify moderator

effects. Theory-driven sub-group analyses were used to estimate the effects of single-player versus multi-player
simulations on the population correlation estimate between self-efficacy and transfer of learning.

Results and Their Educational Significance
The 15 studies that were included in the meta-analysis had a sample size of 2,274 learners with a mean age of
21.40 (SD = 2.84). 49.24% of the learners were female (SD = 21.88). Participants were students in higher
education in 13 studies and military cadets in two studies. The true score population correlation  corrected for
both sampling error and error of measurement was .38 (SD = .02; 80% CV = .35; .41). Preliminary results of the
meta-analytic moderator  estimation    suggest higher   estimates for  single-player  compared with   multi-player
simulations. However, although results indicate higher estimates in single-player simulations, the differences
between conditions are relatively small, and non-significant, p > .05, as the 80% credibility intervals overlap.
        Given   that digital simulations  become   increasingly   popular  environments   for  teaching   complex
cognitive skills (De Jong & Van Joolingen, 1998; Mayer et al., 2011; Siewiorek et al., in press; Tompson &
Dass, 2002), the aim of the present study was to cumulate previous research in order to correct the size of the
true score population correlations between transfer and self-efficacy. In addition, the aim was to estimate the
moderating effects of a social design element: single-player versus multi-player simulations. Implications for
theory  development  include  a  first step toward  generating    a  design-based model   of  learner  efficacy  in
simulation-based e-learning environments (Pineda et al., 2011). Future research can extend the findings reported
here to see whether the present results on self-efficacy can generalize to other motivational dimensions (Garris
et al., 2002; Gegenfurtner, in press; Knogler & Lewalter, in press), vary over different digital infrastructures,
and are stable across different social design elements. Another direction for future research includes a focus on
different samples, such as non-adult populations in K12-education (Knogler & Lewalter, in press).
