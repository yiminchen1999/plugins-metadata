         Abstract:    Despite   the observed    beneficial  effect   of Twitter   on  student    engagement,
         interaction, and overall performance within different subject areas, little empirical evidence is
         available concerning the dynamics of students' activity on Twitter in an educational setting
         and  which   factors  influence this activity.  This  study aims   to observe whether   the   Twitter
         activity of preservice teachers differs in the presence of an instructor serving as a co-Tweeter.
         A   total of six sections, each   with  approximately  20   students   enrolled, of  an educational
         technology course at a large research university in the United States participated in the study.
         We conducted a preliminary content analysis of student tweets from the first two months of
         the course.    The analysis   showed   that students tend to   model  their Twitter  activity on the
         model of the co-tweeting instructor, both in terms of the content of their tweets and their
         likelihood to use certain features.

Twitter is a popular social networking tool, enabling users to share short messages via computers and mobile
devices.  Public twitter users engage in message broadcasting; anyone can see the messages that they share, and
their messages may be aggregated with those of other users based on search terms or hashtags (e.g., #tag).
Twitter  has  been  criticized for creating  more noise   than signal   and for lacking   depth  or substance  (Ebner,
Lienhardt, Rohs, & Meyer, 2010; Suh, Hong, Convertino & Chi, 2010).          At the same time, it has been identified
as a potentially useful knowledge-sharing tool (Dennen & Jiang, 2012; Letierce, Passant, Decker & Breslin,
2010).   For this study, Twitter was implemented in six sections of an undergraduate education class in an
attempt to support knowledge sharing and community building across multiple course sections. We adjusted the
instructor's presence to see how instructor presence and modeling can help shape student Twitter use in a class
setting.

Background
Twitter has been of interest to educators because, like other social media, it holds the potential to support
collaborative interactions and to foster both community building and knowledge sharing (Ebner et al., 2010;
Junco,   Heibergert   & Loken,   2011;   Lee  &  McLoughlin,    2010;   Schroeder,   Minocha     &  Schneider,  2010).
Additionally, many educators have noted the popularity of social networking tools among their students in their
everyday life activities (Merchant, 2012).    In a formal education setting, Twitter has been used to support face-
to-face learning environments (Elavsky et al., 2011; Rinaldo, Tapp, & Laverie, 2011) and to conduct out-of-
class activities (Junco et al., 2011). However, relatively few studies document the use of Twitter as a learning
tool in a higher education setting.  Junco, Heibergert, and Loken (2011) observed a direct relationship between
the use of Twitter to complement face-to-face classes and student grades and engagement.           Rinaldo, Tapp, and
Laverie (2011) observed a relationship between students' involvement and the use of Twitter to support in-class
activities, make   announcements,      solve  student issues,  and   perform   course-related   administrative  duties.
Furthermore, Dunlap and Lowenthal (2009) observed positive relationships between the use of Twitter as a
ubiquitous communication tool, students' interaction, and social presence of the instructor in a distance learning
setting.
         Although these studies suggest a beneficial effect of Twitter on student engagement, interaction, and
overall  performance    within different subject  areas, research  has  not focused   on  the dynamics    of students'
activity on Twitter in an educational setting and which factors influence this activity.    This study aims to fill this
gap, and it is mainly directed to instructors and researchers interested in implementing Twitter as a tool to foster
knowledge sharing and collaborative learning among higher education students.

Context, Purpose and Research Question
As Twitter-using    educators   ourselves,   we believe  that  Twitter  can  be  a   useful tool for   developing and
maintaining a professional learning network.     Rather than just suggesting to preservice teachers that they might
use Twitter for post-graduation professional development, we desired to give them direct experience with how
Twitter could be used to build and interact with a professional learning network. In earlier semesters using
Twitter with these students, we found that participation was minimal and lackluster. Students engaged in little to
no peer interaction, shared few resources, and at best met minimum posting requirements with little substance or
knowledge sharing. However, we noted pockets of desired activity occurring in instances where there was an
instructor presence (Dennen, Kim & Hsieh, 2011). The purpose of this study, then, is to observe whether the
Twitter activity of preservice teachers differs in the presence of an instructor model. Of particular interest is
whether students who have a model make greater use of Twitter elements that support knowledge sharing and

management, such as retweets, hashtags, @replies, and URLs (Dennen & Jiang, 2012), than students who lack
an instructor model.
         Additionally, we looked to see if message content differs across the two conditions. Thus, our research
question is: How does the presence of an active instructor who models knowledge sharing and community
building via Twitter    affect  student   use  of Twitter   across  multiple   sections  of   a university  course?      We
hypothesized that    an ongoing     instructor presence   that modeled  appropriate    tweets   might   encourage    desired
knowledge sharing and community building via Twitter within and across class sections.              The findings of this
study may help researchers and instructors interested in using Twitter as a learning tool--especially in a formal
learning setting with periodical face-to-face meetings and a strong online component--to design Twitter-based
learning activities that shape a specific behavior, promote knowledge sharing, and foster collaborative learning
among higher education students.

Methods
         Participants. The participants in this study were students enrolled in an educational technology course
at a large research university in the United States.      Most students were in education-related majors, although a
few enrolled to  meet   a   university   computer   course  requirement. There     were  six   sections of approximately
twenty students each, and three sections were assigned to each condition. Participation was voluntary and had
no bearing on student grades.

         Study conditions. The study was incorporated into an existing semester-long Twitter participation
assignment. Per this assignment, students were required to post an entry on Twitter on two different days each
week during eleven weeks of the course, for a minimum of 22 tweets during the semester.                  They also were
required to follow at least four Twitter accounts belonging to educators/educational technology experts; to use a
common course hashtag at least five times to communicate with the whole class; to use other hashtags at least
five times; to reply to at least five tweets using the @ function; and use the retweet (RT) function at least five
times.  Beyond these requirements, the content of posts was not constrained.             Students were told that it was
preferable to tweet about course-related topics, to interact with their classmates, and to share relevant resources.
To foster student-student interaction in both conditions, we encouraged students to follow all of their classmates
on Twitter in addition to following the course hashtag.
         Two hashtags were used to aggregate tweets, one for the control group (three course sections) and one
for the experimental group (three course sections). Control group instructors only replied to students if they
received a direct question from students.      Experimental group instructors could do same, but this group had the
addition of an instructor-like person who tweets alongside the students and serves as a model.                One of the
researchers controls the experimental account, and regularly posts tweets to the experiment hashtag.                   These
tweets modeled the desired use of Twitter (e.g., share relevant resources, interacted with course members).

Data Collection and Analysis
The primary     data source     for this  study  is the   students' tweets,  which     were    archived using      HootSuite
(hootsuite.com). Additional data sources include pre- and post-course surveys and student reflection papers.
This brief paper focuses on a content analysis of the student tweets, with the survey data and reflection papers
used for triangulation.     Coding categories were emergent and developed by both researchers together after a
preliminary review of the data.      They fall into three main categories: Course related, school related, and non-
school related. Table 1 presents the codes and an example of each code.

Findings
At the beginning of the semester 22% of students in the control group and 36% of students in the experimental
group were unfamiliar with Twitter.       Further, 24% of students in the control group and 27% of students in the
experimental group were uncomfortable with the idea of using it; those percentages dropped to 12% (control)
and 7%   (experiment)  by    the end  of  the term.  After   tweeting for   a semester,  students  were  not necessarily
enamored with Twitter, but experimental group students were more likely in open survey questions to indicate
that it was a valuable tool for interacting with others and also gave more in-depth and thoughtful critiques of
using Twitter in a class setting.
         Table 2 summarizes the total number of tweets written to the course hashtags by students across both
conditions, and using each of the Twitter communication features. The overall number of tweets was similar
within the two groups, which is not surprising given that students were striving to fulfill assignment-mandated
requirements.  Students in the control group were more likely than students in the experimental group to make
use of the reply feature; this suggests that, in the absence of an instructor, students might tend to communicate
more with each other.  In contrast, students in the experimental group were more likely to retweet, especially the
instructor's entries with links to online material  inherent to the topics covered   in class.  However, the percentage
of tweets that include a link is low for both groups, suggesting that students were not heavily interested in
sharing resources with their classmates.      When the students used additional hashtags, another feature that was
not modeled, they used them expressively rather than for the purpose of aggregation with other related tweets.
Examples of these hashtags are #everymonday, #help, #thatwaseasy, and #notsickanymore.

         Table 3 summarizes the content of students' tweets. Omitted from this summary are retweets, since
they were not composed directly by the students.          Interestingly, students in the control group almost entirely
limited themselves to course-related topics, with most focused on providing a commentary either about an
assignment or about the class in general. An examination of time stamps and tweet content indicated that most
of the tweets were composed the day before class while the students were working on their other homework for
the class (e.g., "Trying to figure out this assignment" and "Finishing my homework"), or, especially for the
control group, during the weekly face-to-face class meeting (e.g., "Learning about wiki in #..." and "Making my
own   storybook in  class").     The  predominant   attitude  toward  the  class and    homework   was   usually  neutral
("Hoping the skill check in #... today isn't too hard"), with peaks of enthusiasm for tools explored in class ("I
learn so much about technology     in my  #... class"). Probably because of the instructor's model, the percentage    of
the tweets about educational technology in general was higher for the experimental group than the control
group.

         The content of the tweets suggests that students were aware of the presence or absence of an instructor.
In the control group, students were more likely to post negative sentiments.      In the experimental group, they
were  more  likely  to  ask  questions and   post about   educational technology     in general.  Students    in the
experimental group    also  were more  likely to  engage  socially on the hashtag,   not  restricting themselves  to
course-related content.

Discussion and Conclusion
These findings  suggest  that the presence   of a co-tweeting  instructor does affect   how  students  use   Twitter.
Students in the experimental condition had a higher tendency to focus on course-related topics, much as the
instructor model did.  However, one unintended effect was the student's orientation toward the instructor in the
experimental condition; rather than interacting with each other more, students engaged in activities that centered
around the model account (e.g., retweeting the model tweets).      At the same time, in the absence of an active
instructor students more freely shared their thoughts about the class.    Thus it seems likely that students were
clearly aware of the presence or absence of an instructor in this activity.   In other words, instructor presence
seems to have influenced both the content of student tweets and students' likelihood to use certain features.
Following their co-tweeting instructor's model, students in the experiment group were more likely to support
knowledge sharing and community building within and across class sections than students of the control group.
         Based on these findings, we recommend that instructors who implement Twitter with their students be
mindful of their desired outcomes and then actively and consistently model the types of tweets and interactions
that should lead to those outcomes for their students.   Providing a static model in the assignment directions is
not sufficient to influence student actions over the course of the semester; an ongoing, dynamic model provides
students with a continuous reminder of how to complete    the assignment. However, student tendency to focus on
interacting with the instructor over each other is concerning and could limit the development of an ongoing
personal network on Twitter.   In future iterations, we plan to adjust the instructor model to include interactions
that should explicitly connect two or more students.
