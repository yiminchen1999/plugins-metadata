         Abstract: The relationship between group performance and structure in completely online,
         large scale    CSCL  learning     environments   is examined     inconsistently.       In    this  study, we
         examine a set of eight completely online graduate student learning groups in a large scale,
         asynchronous,    fully  distributed  CSCL     environment.       We    connect       group     awareness    to
         performance with a comprehensive analysis of the performance and performance changes in
         all eight groups, paying particular attention to the three case study groups.               We look at actual
         performance as scored on a rubric by two raters instead of grades, and we also survey the
         group's regarding their sense of "Group Efficacy".       The group awareness of each of the three
         groups is shown to have a relationship to these two performance measures.

Introduction
Computer Support for Collaborative Learning (CSCL) research contributes to understanding of small groups in
an online context from the perspective of joint knowledge construction (Kimmerle & Cress, 2008), the influence
of argumentation scaffolds on group micro-processes          (Stegmann, Weinerger, & Fischer, 2007) and the use of
technology   for  reflection  (Yukawa,      2006).     Alongside       CSCL    studies     in  research       focused   technical
environments, a parallel movement toward large scale, open education at the University level is changing the
nature of how higher education is delivered (Creelman & Ossiannilsson, 2011).               The need for CSCL research to
focus on large   scale, deployed  learning   environments    is great;   and  growing.      A close examination of small
groups, and  their role   as an  intermediate    level   social construction   between        large     scale communities   and
individual CSCL participants is warranted.
         To address the scalability of CSCL research across space and time with a focus on small groups in
completely  online  university  courses    new approaches     to  performance          measurement      and   evolving  structure
within these groups is necessary.     There are several specific gaps in both the measurement of performance and
the description and understanding of small groups as a vital, intermediate unit of analysis in scalable CSCL.
First, performance is not consistently measured when it is measured at all in studies of online learning.               Student
grades  are frequently  used  as a    method  of convenience,     but   their limited     utility    as a measure    of learning
performance is well documented.       Further, there is wide variation in the meaning of words like "online" and
"computer supported collaborative learning".       In some studies online groups refers to courses where students
meet partially online and partially face to face (Cho, Gay, Davidson, & Ingraffea, 2007; Cress, Barquero, Buder,
& Hesse,    2005; Johnson,   Suriya,   Yoon,  Berrett,   &   Jason,    2002;  Michinov     &   Michinov,       2008;  Michinov,
Michinov, & Toczek-Capelle, 2004) and in other studies the groups are composed of geographically distributed
subgroups where the subgroups meet face to face (Cadima, Ferreira, Monguet, & Ojeda, 2010).                        Only a few
studies look explicitly at the completely online case (Goggins, Mascaro, & Mascaro, 2012; Goggins, Galyen, &
Laffey, 2010).   Making performance measurements more systematic and being specific about the contexts and
interaction patterns examined in CSCL research will enable further, systematic study of scalable CSCL across
space and time.

or other references to the group as a whole. It is also clear that three groups (Individualist, Barriers & Get-
Along)   participate in a combined   interpersonal/group                        oriented                  communication        pattern.    Seven  of the  eight
groups we study are composed of three members, and the eighth group (Canada Group) has four members.
Canada Group is the only group with a significant amount of interindividual communication (as explained in the
literature review, interindividual communication is between individuals, but in a group context such as a side
conversation at a party).   This   may be an             artifact        of     how     communication                      within a    completely online group
changes when the size of the group changes from three members to four, and warrants examination in future
studies.

Performance
The performance and performance trajectory of each case study group is connected to the identity and structure
of the group that emerges from our analysis.                    Individualist Group and Barriers Group experience declines in
performance related to critical events that occurred during the midpoint of the course, module four.                                                Get-Along
Group struggles with performance on the task in module four because it is an unstructured design task for which
the group's well-established socio-technical practices                   are     ill   suited.             The most cohesive group          adapts slowly, and
the least cohesive groups experience difficulty.                 The relationship between identity, structure and performance in
completely online courses appears in these case studies to be a nuanced one.
