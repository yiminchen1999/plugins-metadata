         Abstract: This study aimed to examine the effect of flexible group collaboration on students'
         constructive discourse in a principle-based CSCL environment. The participants included 27
         Chinese undergraduate students taking a 16-week introductory research methods course. The
         online discourse adopted a flexible collaboration structure: fixed small group collaboration in
         the first eight weeks, and opportunistic collaboration in the second eight weeks. The data were
         collected from students' online discourse notes and assignment tasks. Group differences in
         small  group    collaboration  and   differences   between     two    collaboration  structures   were
         examined.    Findings indicated    that flexible  collaboration    design helped    students   to work
         towards  constructive    discourse progressively.    The  study    also  provided   evidence   of  how
         students   new  to   principle-based    approach  engaged    in  online   discourse   for   conceptual
         understanding in the Chinese context.

Introduction
Most studies in CSCL area use the small group as the collaboration structure in classrooms. Empirical studies
have identified  that  there can  be different   patterns  of group   interaction  and  discourse    in a  same  learning
environment. For instance, Hmelo-Silver (2003) uncovered possible group differences owing to the nature of
knowledge that students created. Muukkonen and Lakkala (2009) stated that different groups may hold different
epistemic goals in their online inquiry. In another study, different patterns of online discourse were identified:
some groups focused on knowledge sharing while others concentrated mostly on knowledge construction or
knowledge creation discourse (van Aalst, 2009). In addition, the importance of collaboration at the whole class
level has also been pointed out. For instance, Sawyer (2003) argued that most social collaboration in real life is
improvisational and that it is necessary to account for this characteristic in classroom collaboration. Online
discourse  can   better  cope  with     emergent   learning   needs   and    ongoing    inquiry   progress    as students
opportunistically choose collaborators. Zhang et al. (2009) studied three social configurations in the context of
encouraging "collective cognitive responsibility" (i.e., knowledge building): fixed groups, interacting groups,
and opportunistic groups. During opportunistic collaboration, a number of informal groups formed, disbanded,
and recombined to pursue both individual and collective understanding. The examination of the participatory
patterns  as well   as students'  knowledge      gains indicated  that  opportunistic   groups    facilitated knowledge
advancement. But little is known whether this design can be generalized to different classroom settings.
         In online discourse, students are not only expected to complete group tasks and share ideas; they are
also expected to share responsibility to steering toward constructive knowledge work (Muukkonen, Lakkala, &
Hakkarainen, 2005; Olson, 2003; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003). In other words, students should take the roles
of being  active  agents   in the   process of   externalizing   cognition   at   collective  levels  along   with   social
collaboration, so that knowledge can be discussed, co-constructed, and advanced. One innovative pedagogical
approach that encourages and supports students as agents of their collaborative learning is principle-based, and
provides principles rather than procedures to guide their work (Hong & Sullivan, 2009; Scardamalia & Bereiter,
2003). Previous studies (e.g., Lee et al., 2006; Zhang, 2011) posited that the application of such an approach in
secondary and primary classrooms can facilitate students' collaboration and knowledge building. Despite much
progress, principle-based    approach   remains   rarely  implemented,    particularly  in   undergraduate    classrooms.
Different collaboration  structures  can be  adopted    only  if they are   in accordance    with principles  (Brown    &
Campione,    1996). To   some  extent,  the small  group   is  suitable  for   students who   are  novices  in   computer
discourse, since there are limited numbers of notes to read and respond to, and it is easy to follow learning
progress. By   contrast, the  whole-class discourse    is more   demanding     as students   should  regulate  their  own
learning  continuously,   in  order  to  contribute    to collective   knowledge    and    benefit   from   opportunistic
collaboration.
         Therefore, this study proposed that the adoption of a flexible collaboration structure with a combination
of fixed small group collaboration and opportunistic collaboration may be a more appropriate way of helping
students engage in constructive discourse in a principle-based CSCL environment. Specifically, the study aimed
to partially replicate  Zhang  et al.'s (2009)   design   implemented    in  a Western   primary   classroom     to a one-
semester undergraduate course in the Chinese context. The multi-faceted analysis was carried out to reveal
possible  group  dynamics    characterizing the   nature  of  online  discourse    and  their relation  with  conceptual
understanding. The following three questions were addressed: (1) How did the different groups collaborate
during fixed small group discourse? (2) Did the students go beyond fixed small group collaboration towards

opportunistic collaboration productively? (3) What was the relation between group discourse dynamics and
individuals' conceptual understanding?

Methods and Design

Participants and Instructional Design
The participants in this study were one class of 27 undergraduate students majoring in educational technology at
a university in mainland China. A one-semester course entitled "Basic Research Methods" was divided into two
8-week phases. In the first phase, the students collaborated in fixed small groups, and in the second phase the
whole   class collaborated.    There   was  one-hour,    student-centered    synchronous    discourse  in an    online
platform-Knowledge    Forum    (Scardamalia  &   Bereiter, 2003)   arranged   after regular two-hour   lectures  every
week. The students had no previous experience of participating in online constructive discourse before, while
the course teacher who had five years' experience of using online platforms to supporting students' constructive
discourse. The course materials were divided into several discussion themes covering key concepts included in
the textbook. The classroom activities included creating knowledge products (i.e. questionnaires, group reports)
through designing    and   implementing    small research   projects,   along  with  concept-learning   inquiries    for
strengthening  students' understanding.    The main    goals  of  group   collaboration were:   to develop     students'
responsibility for collaborative learning via conducting small group projects and concept-based discussion, and
to help students to obtain deeper understanding of the nature of knowledge in the context of learning about
research methods.
        A   principle-based  CSCL     environment  was    constructed   based  on   the twelve   knowledge     building
principles (Scardamalia, 2002). This study adopted four principles: (1) idea-centered progressive discourse; (2)
community    knowledge,    collective awareness;  (3)  constructive  use  of  information;  and  (4)  monitoring    and
regulating discourse. These four principles were acceptable for new learners to understand practical meanings of
using them (Lee et al., 2006; Hakkarainen, 2009). They could also avoid conceptual overlap and map out core
features of the twelve knowledge building principles (Chan & Chan, 2011; van Aalst & Chan, 2007). The
students were encouraged to use the above four principles as discussion norms, to work in small groups and then
dig deeper to facilitate learning as a whole class. At the same time, scaffolds in Knowledge Forum such as "I
need to understand",   "Information",   "My  theory"   were   intended    to support students'  cognitive processing
corresponding to basic ideas of the knowledge building principles. The students used these scaffolds when they
created notes, raised questions, and replied to notes. In addition, the course teacher organized offline activities to
facilitate students' online discourse. For instance, the teacher asked students to draw concept maps to frame and
plan their online discourse, evaluate progression and constrains of ongoing collaboration based on the four
principles.

Data sources and analysis
The data sources in this study included students' discourse notes posted to Knowledge Forum and assignment
tasks arranged at the end of the course. Group discourse dynamics were delineated through analyzing social and
cognitive indicators, which were measured through social network analysis (SNA) and content analysis. SNA is
a quantitative method that reveals features of social structures formulated in a community (Haythornthwaite,
1996). In contrast, qualitative content analysis can uncover the nature of knowledge distributed over a particular
network (Gunawardena, Lowe, & Anderson, 1997; Hmelo-Silver, 2003). The combination of these two methods,
therefore, enables complement measurements and provides fruitful information about online discourse (De Laat
et al., 2007; Lipponen et al., 2003).
        The process of data analysis followed four steps. First of all, SNA was conducted to capture the general
picture of collaborative networks generated in Knowledge Forum. Two measures: density and betweenness
centrality  were employed   to evaluate   unidirectional note   reading and   note  responding  interactivity. Density
measured the intensity of interconnection among participants; while Freeman's betweenness centrality measured
the extent to which this network showed equal and distributed interactions rather than dominated by a few
participants (Scott 1991).
        Secondly,    content   analysis was  carried   out   to   discern indications   of  the four   principles   and
characteristics of knowledge distributed in group discourse. For this purpose, a coding scheme was refined
through both theory-driven and data-driven approaches, using a note as the unit of analysis. As demonstrated in
Table1, four main categories (question, idea, metacognition, and reference) identified were basically in line with
the knowledge building principles. The first author rated all online discussion notes, and a second rater re-coded
30%  of the   notes independently.    The inter-rater reliability measured    by Pearson   Correlation was     .83. The
proportion of each category of knowledge distributed in group discourse was then calculated, followed by a
Chi-square test performed to examine possible group difference.
        Thirdly, we used an inquiry thread as the unit of analysis to assess the patterns of group discourse and
advances of collective knowledge. An inquiry thread was a number of notes that address the same principal

problem, thus forming a conceptual stream plotted against a timeline (Zhang et al., 2007). Using this method, all
the notes were reorganized into inquiry threads in terms of discourse themes being investigated. Then notes
included  in  each  thread  were    sequenced    along the  timeline   of contribution.   To    trace   the processes   of
constructive discourse and knowledge advances, we further classified two main categories: question and idea
into several  subcategories.   According   to  Hakkarainen     (2003), progressive    constructive    discourse    can  be
characterized  as the  iterative process   of questioning  and   explanation, with   the  shift   from  fact-oriented   to
explanatory-oriented knowledge. In van Aalst's (2009) study, questions were subcategorized as seeking facts,
clarifications, or explanations; while ideas were classified into seven subcategories: fact, concept, elaboration,
explanation, conjecture, opinion, and rise above. Based on these two coding schemes, top-down and bottom-up
processes   were  performed  to  code  all notes  relating to  questions  and ideas.    We  then  obtained     the coding
subcategories  at  four levels   (from low    to high): fact-oriented,    clarification-oriented, elaboration-oriented,
explanation-oriented question or idea, respectively. The possible knowledge advancement was then examined by
assessing the changes of mean levels of questions and ideas produced in discourse threads. The first author rated
all  online discussion  notes,   and  another  researcher  re-rated  30%   of notes     independently.   The   inter-rater
reliabilities were calculated based on Pearson Correlation, to be .83 for question subcategory and .80 for idea
subcategory, respectively.

              Clarification-oriented    Ask for clarifying relevant elements or characteristics of a concept, or
                                        different opinion

                                        certain opinion, claim, or theory
              Explanation-oriented      Ask   for providing   explanation  on    a particular  theory   or  strategy of
                                        implementing a concept, theory, or claim
 Idea         Fact-oriented             Point out a concept or factual information simply
              Clarification-oriented    State conceptual difference, similarity, characteristic, personal opinion
                                        or experience
              Elaboration-oriented      Elaborate a theory, claim, or opinion with specific statement
              Explanation-oriented      Explain a concept and theory with the support of relevant information,
                                        and example
 Metacognition                          Monitor,   regulate   or evaluate   ongoing     inquiry  process    and group

                                        any additional interpretation

         Finally, the students were asked to complete assignment tasks at the end of the course, so as to examine
their understanding of core concepts relating to research methods that had been discussed on the phases of small
group  collaboration  and  opportunistic   collaboration.  These  assignments      were scored   on   a 4-point  scale  to
evaluate individuals' conceptual understanding, following the scheme developed by van Aalst (2009) with the
consideration  of the degree   of   misunderstanding   on  key concepts   and discourse   themes     being   investigated.
Details of this rating scale are shown in Table 2. Two raters scored all the assignments independently and the
inter-reliability was .79 in terms of Pearson Correlation. A Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to test
the relation between the indicators characterizing social and cognitive dynamics of group collaboration and
individuals' conceptual understanding.

Results

How did the different groups collaborate during fixed small group discourse?
Small   group discourse  was   examined using   social network   analysis  and  content analysis, so  that possible
differences of group collaboration were disclosed. Overall, the students generated 660 notes in Knowledge
Forum. In fixed group phase, the students were randomly assigned to 5 small groups to pursue conceptual
learning and group project design for eight weeks. The degrees of group participation and patterns of interaction
were calculated (see Table 3). There was no variation among five groups on note reading interactions, as shown
by  the highest  reading density  (100%)   and   lowest  betweenness   centrality  (0.0%). This   meant that   each
participant read their group members' notes actively, resulting in equal and distributed reading interactions
occurred in the social networks. By contrast, some variations have been observed in note responding interactions.
More interestingly, Group One and Group Two's measurements in interaction patterns showed the same results,
with the highest density (100%) and lowest betweenness centrality (0.0%) values on both note reading and
responding. It was obvious that all students in these two groups worked intensively with one another. To further
uncover possible group differences, the subsequent analyses were carried out to test cognitive processing using
quantifying content analysis (Chi, 1997).

Note: One student was excluded from analysis as he started to attend the course near the middle of the semester.

         Figure 1  shows   the percentages   of knowledge   classified  by four  main   categories:  question, idea,
metacognition,  and reference.   Apparently, the  majority of   notes produced   by  five groups  referred  to idea
category. Each group also generated relative higher proportion of knowledge categorized as metacognition.
There were noticeable variations on the proportions of question and reference categories among five groups. A
Chi-square analysis confirmed that the distribution of knowledge differed significantly between groups across
four categories (2= 26.2, df = 12, p < .05). In particular, there was a substantial difference (2= 23.6, df = 3, p
< .001) between Group One and Group Two on the distribution of knowledge in terms of four categories, even
though they displayed the same patterns of collaborative networks. It was apparent that Group One contributed
higher  percentage  of  question compared    with  other   four groups. For    Group  Two,  however,    knowledge
distribution was mostly dominated by idea, but there were fewer questions than other groups. Group One and
Group   Two   were further selected to  examine   group  discourse    patterns and possible knowledge      advances
emerged in discourse threads.

         Overall, both groups formulated five discussion threads covering concepts related to research methods:
research question, variables, sampling, interview and questionnaire. On average, there were 16.4 (SD = 12.9)
and 13.4  (SD  =  6.2) notes in  each thread  for Group    One  and Group   Two,   respectively. We   evaluated  all
discourse threads produced in two groups in terms of the discourse patterns identified by van Aalst (2009). In
Group One, two out of five discourse threads revealed knowledge construction, while rests of others remained at
knowledge sharing; but for Group Two, only one discussion thread revealed knowledge construction. In order to

uncover to  what   extent knowledge    was   advanced,    all notes were   reordered  following    the timeline  of
contributions in each discussion thread. We then divided notes in each thread into two periods with equal
proportion of notes. The levels of questions and ideas in discourse threads across two periods were rated on a
4-point scale. As shown in Table 4, Group One generated relatively higher levels of questions and ideas than
Group Two, and the mean levels of questions and ideas increased slightly through discourse as well. In Group
Two, however, there was no increase observed in the means levels of questions and ideas across two periods.
Results indicated that two groups performed differently in sustaining online discourse over time. Group One
seemed to work productively towards constructive discourse compared to the counterpart. No statistical test was
conducted due to small sample sizes (n = 5).

Did  the  students   go    beyond      fixed  small      group   collaboration       towards    opportunistic
collaboration productively?
To assess whether the flexible collaboration structure promoted students' productive discourse, we used the
same data analysis procedures employed in addressing the first research question to evaluate possible group
dynamics across two social configurations as well. On average, the students contributed 12.9 (SD = 3.8) and
12.0 (SD  =  4.9) notes   during small  group  and   opportunistic  collaboration, with   relative consistent  note
contributions across two phases. Table 5 shows the patterns of social collaborative networks in two types of
collaboration structures. Not surprisingly, the value (68.0%) of note reading density measurement of small group
collaboration at the whole class level was much less than the values measured at the five small groups (100%)
separately. In general, the rates of note reading and note responding densities increased from fixed small group
collaboration to opportunistic collaboration, which indicated that the classroom interactivity had spread to more
participants. Simultaneously, betweenness centrality of social collaborative network was calculated considering
both note  reading and    note responding    activities. The   decreasing  trend  in this indicator    implied that
opportunistic collaboration made a broader scope of collaboration possible, resulting in relatively distributed
and evenly social network occurred in the classroom.

        The examination of different characteristics of knowledge (see Figure 2) created by the students found
a significance difference on the distribution of knowledge between small group and opportunistic collaboration
(2 = 38.9, df = 3, p <.001). It was apparent that the highest proportion of knowledge contributed by the students
during group discourse    was  idea. Moreover,   the students'   engagement    showed  increasing   proportions  of
questions and ideas from fixed small group collaboration to opportunistic collaboration. The subsequent analysis
intended to uncover the possible knowledge advancement emerged in discourse threads.

          Altogether, the 27 participants were involved in 33 inquiry threads during the semester. We assessed
each thread according to the discourse patterns identified by van Aalst (2009). Five of twenty-three inquiry
threads involved knowledge construction during small group collaboration, while six of ten threads revealed
knowledge    construction during opportunistic   collaboration.  All  other  threads   were assessed  as   knowledge
sharing discourse.  In addition, the  mean    lengths of   threads were   14.3 (SD   = 8.3)  notes   for small group
collaboration and   31.0  (SD =  22.2) notes   for  opportunistic  collaboration. As   found  in previous   analysis,
knowledge construction discourse was examined to be more evident in promoting knowledge advances than
knowledge sharing discourse. Five threads rated as knowledge construction discourse in each collaboration
structure were selected to further investigate the degrees of knowledge advancement. As shown in Table 6, the
mean levels of questions and ideas raised in the process of small group and opportunistic collaboration. It was
noticeable that the mean level of questions in opportunistic collaboration was higher than that in small group
collaboration. Also, the advancement of knowledge in opportunistic collaboration was more evident than in
fixed groups. In addition, there was very little increase observed in the mean level of ideas contributed in two
collaboration structures in the discussion threads. The results suggested that the students attempted to engage in
constructive  discourse   by  going  beyond   small   group  collaboration    towards   opportunistic    collaboration
progressively. During this process, the students made progress in generating higher level of questions. However,
there was little improvement in contributing higher level of ideas. No statistical test was performed due to
limited number of threads (n = 5).

What was the relation between group discourse dynamics and individuals' conceptual
understanding?
The above two research questions addressed discourse dynamics within and across groups by measuring social
and cognitive indicators. The third research question moved to understanding how group collaborative dynamics
impacted  students' conceptual   understanding  by  performing     a Pearson   correlation analysis.  In general, the
students' assignment tasks covered 18 inquiry threads discussed in Knowledge Forum. The assignments were
scored to evaluate the degree of conceptual understanding for each individual student. At the same time, social
and cognitive  indicators corresponding    to those 18    discussion threads   were calculated.  Table   7 shows  the
relationships among the indicators of group discourse dynamics and individuals' conceptual understanding.

         Results found that the numbers of note reading and note responding indicators in each discussion
thread were significantly correlated to students' conceptual understanding (r = .64, p < .01; r = .53, p < .05). Of
four indicators characterizing different types of knowledge contributed in online discourse, question and idea
were correlated significantly to conceptual understanding (r = .50, p <.05; r = .64, p < .01). However, no
significant correlation was found among the numbers of metacognition, reference contributed in the discourse
threads  and  conceptual   understanding.     The statistical result demonstrates    that the  mean  level  of questions
contributed to conceptual understanding positively (r = .59, p < .01). In addition, the mean level of questions
significantly correlated to the level of ideas (r = .55, p < .05). Yet, there was no significant relation found
between the mean level of ideas and conceptual understanding. The results suggested that contributing larger
numbers of ideas and questions could facilitate students' conceptual understanding. In particular, questioning
played an important role in deepening understanding.

Discussion and Conclusion
The purpose    of this  study   was  to  investigate  the effect of  combining    fixed small  group  and   opportunistic
collaboration to facilitate Chinese undergraduate students' constructive discourse in a principle-based CSCL
environment. Departing from the earlier research that adopted opportunistic collaboration in a Western primary
classroom, the current study extended the design in a Chinese context by integrating online discourse into a
regular undergraduate course.
         The present study did not simply replicate methods of the earlier study that primarily compared social
structures and processes at a class level across three successful years. Rather, the study targeted at another angle
by examining group collaboration dynamics at three aspects: patterns of social interaction, characteristics of
knowledge distributed within groups, and knowledge advances emerged along discourse threads. This kind of
multi-faceted    analysis not   only validated    the findings   against  the previous    research, but  also  uncovered
fine-grained dynamics of online group discourse. The examination of group collaboration in fixed small groups
found that   all five  groups   showed    intensive   collaboration, but  they  differed  substantially  on contributing
different characteristics of knowledge. In particular, two small groups with the same interaction patterns showed
large variations in the knowledge distribution and knowledge advancement. It implied that intensive group
interactions might    not necessarily    lead to  higher  cognitive  processing.   Moreover,   social  network  analysis
revealed  that   social   interactivity spread   to   more   participants from    fixed  small  group   collaboration to
opportunistic collaboration and this extended scope of group collaboration promoted relative equal interactions
in the class, which was compatible with the findings from the previous study (Zhang et al., 2009). Apart from
examining the positive impact of changing group configuration on individuals' knowledge gains that has been
reported in  Zhang    et  al.'s (2009)  study, the    present study  also  tested associations  between   the  indicators
characterizing   social   and   cognitive  dynamics     and   students'   conceptual  understanding.    Consistent  with
Hakkarainen's (2003) study that uncovered the important roles of questions in deepening understanding, data
analysis found    that  both  the  number   and   level   of  questioning  were   positively  correlated to   individuals'
conceptual understanding. It was noteworthy that the majority of knowledge produced by the students refereed
to idea. However, the level of ideas did not change greatly in discussion threads and it was also not significantly
correlated to conceptual understanding, whereas the number of ideas was positively correlated with conceptual
understanding. One reason may be because the students encountered difficulties in improving ideas collectively.
Another possible reason is that discourse itself encompasses the interplay between different levels of knowledge,
which caused the advancement of ideas along inquiry threads was slower than expected.
         To conclude, this study supported the advantage in facilitating students' constructive knowledge work
through flexible collaboration design in a principle-based CSCL environment. The examination of students'
online discourse and assignment tasks revealed how Chinese undergraduate students new to principle-based
approach  and    constructive    discourse  could    go   beyond  small   group   collaboration  towards    opportunistic
collaboration  in  advancing     individual   and collective  understanding    progressively.  Additionally,   the study
provided an example of integrating social network analysis and content analysis to uncover interdependent roles
of social and cognitive dynamics in online discourse. Owing to the limitation on small sample size, further
studies are needed to validate the findings in various classroom settings. It would also be valuable to trace how
opportunistic groups emerge and how individual students benefit from and contribute to group collaboration.
