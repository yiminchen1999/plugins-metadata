         Abstract: Collaboration is one of the core practices in science education (NRC, 1996; NRC,
         2012) that has been built into many technology-enhanced learning environments to promote
         deep understanding (Manlove, Lazonder, & De Jong, 2009). Typically, these environments
         provide multiple external representations (MERs) for students to understand and communicate
         scientific knowledge. However, little is known about how students organize knowledge in
         MERs    when   they engage  in  collaborative  argumentation.    In  this study,  we designed  an
         argumentation based science unit in a computer supported collaborative learning environment.
         We investigated how this learning environment affected students' knowledge organization and
         argumentation on the socio-scientific issue of nuclear energy. We found that the students used
         all the available representational modes in the environment to make sound arguments and it
         appeared that the textual representation knowledge entries were the most linked nodes in the
         knowledge web the students produced as a group.

Introduction
Students  nowadays   access  information  in  the  forms   of multiple   external  representations (MERs)  such   as
computer  models,   dynamic  and  static pictures,  and texts  through   information   communication   technologies
(ICT). Research suggests that students benefit from MERs when learning complex scientific phenomena and
processes (Ainsworth,   2006; Kozma,     2003).  MERs   can   be used  in  the classrooms  as pedagogical  tools  to
promote  scientific argumentation.  The  quality  of MERs     "becomes    the  focal point of the  discussion in the
classroom as students evaluate and critique methods, explanations, evidence, and reasoning" (Sampson & Clark,
2009, p.450). However, it is still unclear how students organize MERs to make coherent scientific arguments
(Erduran, 2012).
   In  this study,  we  designed and implemented     an  argumentation    based   computer  supported collaborative
learning (CSCL)    unit on  socio-scientific issues  (SSI) in  order  to  study the  connection   between students'
knowledge organization through MERs and their scientific argumentation processes. Through the study, we
addressed the following research questions:
         1.  How does an argumentation-based CSCL environment affect learners' collaborative knowledge
             organization with MERs?
         2.  How does students' collaborative knowledge organization with MERs affect their argumentation
             on a given socio-scientific issue in a CSCL environment?
             a)    What is the most prominent type of MERs students mostly rely on when they collaboratively
                   organize their knowledge on a given SSI in an argumentation based CSCL environment?
             b)    What is the process of using MERs when they argue on a given SSI in an argumentation based
                   CSCL environment?

Theoretical Framework

Knowledge Organization
In today's technology mediated society, information is easily generated, distributed and accessed through ICT.
Since there is almost no limit on accessing information, education should help students develop competencies in
searching for, archiving, using, and generating relevant information and organizing it in ways that make sense
for current or future use. Our conceptualization of knowledge organization stems from the literature in learning
sciences including MERs, knowledge integration (Linn, 2006) and knowledge building (Scardamalia & Bereiter,
2006).
         People understand, communicate, and organize information in a variety of modalities including actions,
verbal explanations, written texts, physical experiments, computer models, and static and motion pictures and
diagrams.   The  use of  MERs    can help    capture learners'   interest  (Ainsworth,  1999),   and enhance   their
understanding   of science concepts  (e.g.,  Chandrasegaran,   Treagust,   &   Mocerino,   2011; Waldrip, Prain,  &
Carolan, 2010).
         Linn and    colleagues developed    the  knowledge    integration framework    that  emphasizes  students'
abilities in establishing connections among scientific ideas (Linn & Eylon, 2011; Linn, 2006). The framework

CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                            Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

promotes coherent understanding by encouraging students to elicit, add, distinguish, and sort out ideas. The
framework has been used to develop a rich library of technology enhanced curricula supporting student learning
in science (Linn, Lee, Tinker, Husic, & Chiu, 2006; Liu, Lee, Hofstetter, & Linn, 2008; Slotta & Linn, 2009).
          Knowledge building advocates for creating communities of learners who build knowledge together
(Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). Members of a knowledge community use epistemic artifacts (Sterelny, 2005)
such   as abstract or concrete     models    to reflect  their understanding.   Since  these  epistemic  artifacts are
fundamental components of the knowledge building process, organizing them in a coherent way is the key to
developing scientific understanding for both individual and groups of learners.
          We define knowledge organization as the individual or collaborative processes of searching, sorting
out, archiving, and externalize knowledge in a systematic way to achieve a better understanding of the world
and to prepare for future learning. It differs from knowledge integration (Linn, 2006) in the sense that it focuses
on tagging and organizing knowledge that is externally represented, but not necessarily conceptually integrated
in the mind of the learner at the moment. Knowledge organization can be personnel; therefore, the organization
structure may not be aimed for public use, which is essential in knowledge building (Scardamalia & Bereiter,
1994). A knowledge organization process of an individual or a group could be intertwined with and complement
to knowledge integration and knowledge building.

Collaboration
Collaboration has been advocated as one of the core practices of science education in national science education
policy documents over the past two decades (NRC, 1996; NRC, 2012). Collaboration is also a core component
of inquiry activities (Simons & Clark, 2005) as it engages students to knowledge construction and delve into
their  own  understanding     of scientific phenomena    (Komis,  Ergazaki,    & Zogza,  2007). Additionally,    when
students involve in collaborative learning, they encounter vast amount of distinct ideas and views, which urges
them to organize and integrate those ideas (Linn, 2006). Research indicates that students achieve higher learning
goals when they collaborate comparing to individual learning (see, for example, Cohen & Scardamalia, 1998;
Lou, Abrami, & D'Apollonia, 2001).
          Collaboration has been built into many technology-enhanced learning environments to promote deep
understanding (Manlove et al., 2009).        As a rising field, computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL)
studies how   people  learn   together with  the  help   of computers  (Stahl,  Koschmann,   & Suthers,  2006).    It is
different from traditional types of learning as it is "concerned with collaborative meaning making processes that
go  beyond    information sharing    among      multiple people"  and   "highlights the  potential impact   of   social
community through computers as vehicles for transforming activity procedures" (Yoon & Brice, 2011, p.251).

Scientific Argumentation
There are several reasons for practicing argumentation in science classrooms, especially on SSI related topics
(e.g., Sadler &  Donnelly,    2006;  Zohar   &  Nemet,   2002).  As   Duschl and  Osborne  (2002)  argued   "situating
argumentation as a critical element in the design of science learning environments both engages learner with the
conceptual and epistemic goals and, for the purposes of the practice of formative assessment by teachers, can
help make science thinking visible" (p. 44). Practicing argumentation allows students to use available data and
evidence to construct knowledge, clarify meanings, and reflect on their own thinking (Duschl & Osborne, 2002).
In addition to making thinking visible, Jimenez-Aleixandre and Erduran (2007) propose five advantages of
using argumentation in science classrooms: (1) the access to students' cognitive and metacognitive processes,
(2) the   development of  discourse    practices  and   thus critical thinking, (3) increased scientific literacy, (4)
enculturation into scientific culture and the development of epistemic criteria, and (5) developing reasoning and
rational criteria. CSCL may incorporate scientific argumentation. Noroozi, Weinberger, Biemans, Mulder, and
Chizari   (2012) did an extensive    review   of literature  on  argumentation   based CSCL    and  found   that these
environments foster in-depth discussions (Andriessen, Baker & Suthers, 2003), and help learners achieve deeper
understanding and productive arguments (Buckingham-Shum, 2003). SSIs are particularly useful for promoting
interest in learning science (Sadler & Zeidler 2004; Zeidler, Walker, Ackett, & Simmons, 2002). Research
indicates  that  facilitating argumentation     through  the use  of  SSI can   increase students' use   of scientific
knowledge in constructing arguments (Zohar & Nemet, 2002).
          In sum, in an active and collaborative learning environment, individual learners work with each other
to learn and co-construct scientific knowledge. Their understanding will evolve through processes including re-
organization  of   information,   representation  of  knowledge    in  MERs,    and  cogeneration  of argumentative
discourse. So will the knowledge artifacts produced by the group of learners. With this vision in mind, we build
and test a new learning environment, the innovative knowledge organization system (iKOS), which will be
described in the following.

We developed a science unit on nuclear energy using the iKOS system and implemented it with a group of
college students. We examined the nature of the knowledge web the students created and the argumentative
discourse they generated, in order to make sense of the interaction between their knowledge organization and
scientific argumentation.

The innovative Knowledge Organization System (iKOS)
iKOS is a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporates three distinct MERs: Event, Wiki, and
Concept Map.   In the event mode students can insert static pictures and can tag them in order to have a holistic
understanding of complex scientific phenomena and systems. Students write textual entries in the wiki mode
similar to popular Wikipedia pages. Students can also create concept maps (Novak & Cañas, 2008) in the
system and visualize the connections among a set of related science concepts. iKOS automatically interlinks
students' knowledge entries through keywords and forms a web of knowledge entries. The system has also
social functions such as co-editing, commenting and rating blocks to foster students' collaborative learning
practices. The system also  reports basic   descriptive statistics of group learning and social networking    (see
Figure 1).

                      Figure 1. iKOS snapshots: (left) an event entry and (right) a statistics screen.

Design of an Argumentation-based Science Unit on Nuclear Energy
We designed an argumentation-based science unit using the iKOS system with the following goals in mind: 1)
to help students understand the complex nature of a phenomena or SSI through the interlinked knowledge web,
2) to help students organize knowledge effectively, 3) to help students efficiently retrieve information and
identify information, 4) to help students co-construct knowledge entries and learn from each other. We chose the
topic of nuclear energy based on notions associated with SSI, which can engage students in argumentation and
drive them to think critically (Zeidler & Nichols, 2009; Zohar & Nemet, 2002). Nuclear energy is a prominent,
controversial, and open-ended real life phenomenon (Sadler, 2004) with the historical crisis including the recent
meltdown of the nuclear reactor in Fukushima, Japan. The unit included the following major steps:
       Introduction to the iKOS system. Students get familiar with the learning environment (e.g., create
accounts, create iKOS entries in different modes).
       Introduction to the topic of nuclear energy. Students read news regarding a new nuclear reactor to be
built in the state they are living in. They also watch videos focusing on the pros and cons of using nuclear
energy. They brainstorm initial ideas related to nuclear energy.
       Creating iKOS entries individually. Students create entries in different modes individually. They then
submit these entries as open for the whole class.
       Creating iKOS entries collaboratively. The students work in small groups to create iKOS entries and
form arguments about either supporting or objecting the construction of the power plant. They also need to
argue: 1) should we build nuclear power plants? 2) How far should we rely on nuclear energy as an energy
source? During this small group activity, the students were also encouraged to investigate one specific scientific
aspect of Nuclear Energy (e.g., radiation).
       Peer critique and revision. Students may co-edit or critique peers' entries and revise their own based on
peers' feedback.
       Final presentation and argumentation. At the end of the unit, students present their findings and argue
for their stance on the issue of building nuclear power plants.

Participants and Implementation
This study was implemented with a class of student who were enrolled in a course Technology for Science
Teaching in a large public southeastern university in the United States. The second author taught the course.
There were 21 students enrolled in the course and 19 students (2 undergraduate students, 17 graduate students)

CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                        Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

consented to participate in the study. We only collected data from the students who consented. The class met
once a week (2.5hrs/wk), and the unit was carried out in three consecutive weeks (only the second week was
entirely devoted to this unit). In week one, it took the class about 45 minutes to go through the iKOS system.
They were then assigned as homework to create individual entries, one per mode. In week two, the students
were divided into four small groups (2 with four students each and 2 with five students each) and carried out the
bulk of the activity (~150min). Also, two groups were able to present their work during week two. In week
three, the two remaining groups presented their findings and we carried out a whole class discussion (~35min).

Data Collection and Analysis
Our   data collection   included participant observation  (Suzuki,  Ahluwalia,   Arora, &   Mattis, 2007),   video
recording, and iKOS entries and descriptive statistics generated through the iKOS system. We were conscious
that video recording might affect the students' responses and behavior in the learning environment so we tried to
move the camera as little as possible to keep the distraction at a minimum level.
         To investigate our first research question, we focused on examining the patterns of the iKOS entry
networks created by the students. We considered each individual iKOS entry as a node, and the links between
the nodes were categorized into two types: direct links and indirect links. A direct link is defined as a connection
between two entries when the title of one entry is a keyword of the other; an indirect link is defined when two
entries share one or more keywords.
         Applying the social network analysis techniques, we calculated the degree centrality for each iKOS
entry which measures the extent to which one node is connected with the rest of the knowledge web (Knoke &
Yang, 2007). In the iKOS system, we summed all the links associated with one entry; to get the normalized
degree centrality, we divided this number by the possible number of links this entry has in the knowledge web.
We  then   calculated the mean   normalized   degree centralities associated with  the particular representational
modes and the whole knowledge web.
         In order to investigate our second research question, we transcribed the videos verbatim and analyzed
students' final presentations. Our unit of analysis was a coherent statement made by a student that delivers a
stand-alone meaning. We coded each relevant statement in terms of its direct relevance to the type of iKOS
entry for  each  group  and  we  summed    up  these numbers  and  reported  the  percentages. In addition   to the
quantified results, we also reported a representative case in order to provide a more vivid scenario for the reader
to make sense of the learning processes (Creswell, Hanson, Clark Plano, & Morales, 2007).

Results

Network of Students' iKOS Entries
The students created 20 event 19 wiki and 24 concept map entries for the homework assignment and created
additional 4 event, 4 wiki, and 4 concept map entries during the class activity in the second week. Table 1 shows
the total number of links for the entries in each of the three iKOS modes. Apparently, indirect links are much
more pervasive than direct links between entries. In terms of total links, the wiki mode has the highest number.

         Table 2 shows the mean normalized degree centrality for the iKOS knowledge web, in which the
entries were linked either directly or indirectly. Our results indicated that the wiki mode had the highest mean
degree  centrality, for both the  directly and indirectly linked  knowledge  webs.   This suggests  that the most
"centralized" entry mode was the wiki mode in this learning unit. This was not expected because students had to
manually type in keywords for the wiki mode, while in other modes the computer will automatically register the
keywords.   This result  suggests that the  students were  mindful  of and   good at generating   their wiki entry
keywords.

Knowledge Organization and Argumentation
We analyzed students' arguments on the final presentation sessions. Table 3 shows the percentages of each
groups' argumentation  relevant to  their MERs.  Apparently,  different groups    relied    on different   types of
representations in their arguments. Overall, there was a significant relationship for groups and representational
modes, meaning that categorical variables were not independent and groups relied on to certain modes more on
their arguments (Chi square test for independence, 2= 27.6, df=6, p<0.001).

Although the groups referred to the representation modes quite differently in their argumentation, through the
analysis of group discussions and presentations, we found that students incorporated MERs in a holistic manner
to present a sound argument on the given SSI. In the following we present a case to illustrate this point.
        Group 1 focused on the environmental impact of the nuclear energy in general and the group was
against the construction of the nuclear power plant and relying on nuclear energy as an energy source.   A total of
55% of their statements were based on the event entry they created. However, they initiated their argument
based on the wiki entry they created. In their wiki entry they stated that they will focus on the "environmental
impacts associated with the disposal of effluent wastewater produced by a secure and functioning nuclear power
facility" and described the effluent water waste in the process of cooling nuclear rods (Group1, Wiki Entry).
They initiated the discourse based on their definitions and knowledge organization about the effluent water
waste:

        Derrick: We are looking actually at the water which is most of the time not retaining and
        injected right back into environment. Ok? This water typically starts as sewage. They take
        sewage water, remove contaminants, cool the nuclear rods, and then ship it right back at
        ocean, river or lakes. So what are the impacts associated with that? Number one we super-
        heated  the water. And  so... we  also have  environmental impact   there as far    as  changing
        ecosystems.

These  statements made  by  Derrick also  reflected his group's collaborative knowledge        organization  in  the
Concept map mode. Because in their concept map, they illustrated that nuclear waste flows to water and the
water temperature rises. Ray, on the other hand, changes the direction of the conversation using the event entry
they created.

        Ray: This [shows their event entry to the class] is just a representation that you [Derrick] are
        talking about how the water is either evaporated and this contaminants get into the atmosphere
        or they are directly injected into the water system. And the end result is it affects humans
        directly and the atmosphere and plant life animal life affected negatively as well.
        Derrick: It also represented in the bio magnification. Because when you start to impact what
        we eat that is magnified to us tenfold twentyfold. So there is a lot of contamination out there
        that we are not looking at when we just think about nuclear power.

Here Ray showed the part of their pictorial representation where contaminants from the water go through the
irrigation process to grass and then to the cows and then humans. This argument was also reflected in their
concept map, which showed that nuclear waste can leak to underwater repository and directly harms people's or
animals' lives.
        The discourse above illustrates that although this group relied mostly on the event mode, they also
incorporated all the other representation modes in order to drive their argument to the point that they stated
possibilities of how effluent water waste can impact the environment. Derrick was a representative when they
were presenting their argument. Based on their knowledge organization practices with using MERs Derrick
concluded that:

        We    don't  think there are enough   standards    or safe  guards  in  place based   on    what just
        happened in Japan, which is supposed to be the technology leaders. As far as natural disasters
        protecting yourself against natural disaster we do not feel there is enough safeguards in place
        yet put one in our own backyard.

This case shows how students' knowledge organization process affects their discourse and arguments. In this
case, although the students' argumentation benefited from one particular type of representational mode, further
analysis of their argumentation indicated that the students used all the three representational modes in the proper
places of the discourse to arrive at their conclusion and make sound arguments with the help of data they put in
MERs.

Discussion and Conclusion
Recently, science education field has been witnessed the growing body of research advocating for using those
representations to capture learners' interest (Ainsworth, 1999), and capture and enhance students' understanding
of science concepts (e.g., Chandrasegaran, Treagust, & Mocerino, 2011; Waldrip et al., 2010). Based on the
positive effects of using MERs in science learning, we were interested in students' collaborative knowledge
organization  practices with  MERs   on socio scientific   issues. Our  results   indicated that degree  centrality of
students collaborative knowledge entries were highest in their wiki entries. We were hypothesizing that the
concept maps would be most prominent representations in terms of degree centralities for indirect links since the
computer automatically generates key words and links the entries. However, our results showed that students
made their knowledge organization process more interconnected in the wiki mode, because students generated
better key words to connect their entries with other entries. Also, our interpretation is that even though students
can represent their knowledge in the forms of concept maps and pictorial representations, they may still feel the
need for verbally explaining their findings to make their knowledge organization and understanding visible for
their audience.
        We were also interested in seeing how students' knowledge organization relied on the use of MERs
when students argue on a given SSI. Our results indicated that students used different modes of representations
in their arguments. We want to point out that even though this result might be interpreted as students with
different learning abilities use different representation in their arguments, our analysis of students' discourse
illustrated that the students used all  three representational    modes  in their  arguments     to produce   a sound
argument based on their collaborative knowledge organization with MERs. Therefore, we conclude that students
can create  MERs    in our system  when  they  organize    their knowledge  and    make their    arguments   based  on
multiple data sources they put in those MERs.
        Although our learning unit is promising from several aspects, it also has several limitations. First, our
intervention is short for making general judgments on students' collective learning using iKOS. Secondly, we
did not analyze the student-generated arguments in terms of their structural, content, and justification qualities.
In the future we will analyze students' collaborative arguments with a larger sample size to make judgments
about the effect of our learning unit. It is our hope that teachers and students will be able to use this tool in order
to make quality   arguments,  enhance   deep  understanding    of  the scientific concepts,  and    organize scientific
knowledge in a more coherent way to learn complex scientific phenomena in a more holistic manner, and
collaborate and assess their peers' entries in the system.
