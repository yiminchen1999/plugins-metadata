        Abstract: Epistemological beliefs were found to affect students' cognitive engagement, study
        strategies, as well as motivation in classroom settings. However, research on the relationship
        between epistemological beliefs, motivation, and student learning in online settings has been
        under-studied      and   under-theorized.   This  study     investigated  the   relationships   among
        epistemological beliefs, achievement goals, and learning performance in online discussions.
        124 students participated in discussion activities in an online instructional technology course.
        The    results  from   correlation  analysis   and    structural equation   modeling     indicate  that
        epistemological beliefs have significant effects on students' learning performance, through the
        mediation of achievement goals.

Introduction
Epistemological beliefs (EB) were found to affect students' cognitive engagement, study strategies, as well as
motivation.   However,   research    on the interplay   between     EB,  motivation,    and  student   participation  and
perception in the context of online learning has been under-studied and under-theorized. In order to fill this gap
in the literature, this study  built and   tested a model     among  EB,  motivation,   and   student  participation  and
perception in asynchronous online discussion activities in a college-level online class.

Theoretical Framework
EB  refers to  individual's  beliefs about  knowledge    and   knowing    (Hofer  &  Pintrich,   2002).  Studies on   EB
generally focus on five dimensions: the structure of knowledge (ranging from the belief that knowledge can be
described  as  isolated pieces to  the  belief that knowledge      structure is complex     and highly interrelated), the
certainty of knowledge (ranging from the belief that knowledge is certain and unchanging to the belief that
knowledge is tentative and evolving), the nature of ability to learn (ranging from the belief that ability to learn
is innate to the belief that learning ability can be acquired with effort), the speed of learning (ranging from the
belief that learning takes place quickly or not at all to the belief that learning is a gradual process), and the
source of knowledge (ranging from the belief that knowledge comes from omniscient authorities to the belief
that knowledge emerges from personal construction) (Schommer, 1990; Schraw, Bendixen & Dunkle, 2002;
Braten & Stromso, 2005). Past research suggested that EB could influence academic performance (e.g., Qian &
Alvermann, 1995; Schommer-Aikins, Duell, & Hutter, 2005; Schommer-Aikins & Easter, 2006; Schommer,
1993;  Windschitl,  1997),  cognitive   engagement     (e.g., DeBacker   &   Crowson,   2006;    Ravindran, Greene,    &
DeBacker, 2005), and study strategies (e.g., Kardash & Howell, 2000; Schommer, Crouse, & Rhodes, 1992).
        Students' motivation in achievement settings is often examined through the lens of goal orientations,
which  focus   on  the  reasons  for students'    engagement    in  academic    activities. According   to achievement
motivation  theories,   there  are   three  types   of goals:   mastery   goals,  performance-approach      goals,    and
performance-avoidance goals (A. Elliot, 1999; A. Elliot & Church, 1997; E. Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996).
Studies have reliably shown the connection between achievement goals and learning. For example, individuals
with mastery goals are likely to choose challenging tasks, show interest, persistence and effort, demonstrate
self-regulated learning,   adopt meaningful    study   strategies, and achieve   better learning  outcomes   (A. Elliot,
McGregor, & Gable, 1999; E. Elliot & Dweck, 1988; Eppler & Harju, 1997; Graham & Golan, 1991; Licht &
Dweck, 1984). Self-efficacy is another theory that examines students' motivation. Defined as "the conviction
that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes," (Bandura, 1977, p. 193), self-
efficacy is a person's inter belief of his or her own competency. Compared with individuals with low self-
efficacy, those with higher levels of self-efficacy are likely to initiate effort when faced with challenging tasks,
show more persistence and effort, adopt meaningful learning strategies, and achieve better academic learning
outcomes (Greene & Miller, 1996; Pajares & Miller, 1994; Walker, Greene, & Mansell, 2006; Zeldin & Pajares,
2000; Zimmerman & Bandura, 1994). Recent studies investigated the relationship between EB and students'
motivation in classroom settings. The findings generally suggested that students who held less mature beliefs
were less likely to adopt mastery goals but more likely to adopt performance goals, and those who held more
mature beliefs  were    on the contrary  (e.g., Braten  &     Strømsø, 2004;    DeBacker    &   Crowson,  2006;  Schutz,
Pintrich, & Young, 1993).
        While studies have demonstrated the individual relationships between EB, motivation and learning,
there is a need to understand how these variables interact with each other within a broader network. Existing

few attempts examined these networked relationships in classroom settings (Chen & Pajares, 2010; Kizilgunes,
Tekkaya, & Sungur, 2009; Ravindran, et al., 2005). As today's learning environment is shifting from classroom
to online settings, it becomes necessary to investigate the interrelationships among these constructs in an online
learning environment.
         Further, recent research indicated that students' actual participation and learning behavior can greatly
reflect their motivation    (Fredricks,  Blumenfeld,  &  Paris, 2004;    Reeve, 2006).    However,    studies on the
relationship between EB and learning have been mainly relying on students' self-reported cognitive engagement
(e.g., DeBacker & Crowson, 2006; Ravindran, et al., 2005) or study strategies (e.g., Kardash & Howell, 2000;
Schommer,     et al., 1992), while  the  relationship between   EB and    students'  learning  behaviors  is  largely
unknown. Technologies like learning management systems (e.g., WebCT©) make it possible to track a variety
of students' participation records in online learning activities (Xie, 2012), which is a challenging tasks in face-
to-face settings (Dennen, 2008). The online participation data enable researchers to develop better insights into
students' online learning behaviors and their relationship with motivation.
         This study investigated the interplay among EB, motivation, and student participation and perception in
asynchronous     online learning. Based   on  the existing literature, we hypothesized    that EB  would   influence
students' motivation (i.e., achievement goals and self-efficacy), which in turn affected students' participation in
as well as perception of online learning. We further hypothesized that EB not only influence online learning
indirectly through motivation, but also had direct impact on online learning.

Methodology

Participants
124 students (33 males and 91 females) from an online instructional technology class at a large Southeast
university participated in this study. The course focused on... The ages were ranged from 19 to 61. One of the
major assignments in this course was online discussions on selected topics of instructional technology. The
online discussions were facilitated by iDiscuss, a system that is capable of tracking students' participation
record. 116 participants (94%) rated their confidence level as high in the use of technology to complete the
coursework.

Measurement
Five groups of variables were measured in this study (1) EB, (2) goal orientation, (3) perceived competence, (4)
perceived learning performance, and (5) online participation.
         Epistemological beliefs inventory (EBI) was used to assess students' EB (32 items) (Schraw, Bendixen
& Dunkle, 2002). The EBI has five subscales: (1) simple knowledge, (2) certain knowledge, (3) fixed ability,
(4) quick learning and (5) omniscient authority. A recent validation study documented that the subscale  of
those   measuring  variables ranged  from    0.50­0.60s across  two    administrations, and  test­retest correlations
ranged from 0.62 to 0.81 (see Schraw et al, 2002). Questionnaire on approaches to learning was used to assess
students' three achievement goal orientations: (1) mastery, (2) performance-approach, and (3) performance-
avoidance. The subscale 's typically ranging from 0.60­0.90s (see Greene, Dillon & Crynes, 2003; Miller,
Greene, Montalvo, Ravindran & Nichols, 1996). Perceived competence scale is composed of 6 questions asking
students to rate their perceived learning competence in online discussions. Perceived learning scale has 10
questions measuring students' perceptions of their learning. Students' online participation was measured by the
quantitative data collected from the iDiscuss system, which includes students' posting behaviors (total number
of posts) and non-posting behaviors (total topics read, number of times logged in).

Procedure
Students worked in small groups of 8-10 to participate daily in online discussion activities in a 16-week session.
Each student moderated a chapter discussion for a designated week within his or her own group. During the
course, student peers were invited to share information and contribute to knowledge constructions in the chapter
discussions. The instructor monitored students' discussion activities and supported the discussion when needed.
Participants were invited to complete the above-mentioned set of instruments during the semester.

Results
To test  the  relationships  among  EB,   perceived   competence,  achievement   goals,  and   learning  performance
(including perceived learning performance and actual online participations) in a CSCL setting, three steps of
analyses  were   performed.   The  first step analyzed  the  sample    items, descriptive statistics, and  reliability
coefficient for the items measuring each of the variables. The second step generated a correlation matrix to
examine the relationships among variables of interest. The third step involved the utilization of Structural
Equation  Modeling      (SEM), using    maximum   likelihood techniques   with  AMOS      version 18.   SEM   allows

structured framework.
       Table 1 shows the sample items of measured variables, their descriptive statistics, and the reliability
coefficient among the items within each of the variables. As can be found in Table 1, students scored higher in
the mastery goals (mean = 5.96) and perceived learning (mean = 5.26). They scored lower in two of the EB
variables: quick learning (mean = 2.46) and certain knowledge (mean = 3.07).

       Zero-order correlation analysis results (Table 2) suggested that EB variables are correlated with each
other, except for the relationship between authority and quick learning. Among the goal variables, mastery goal
has a significant correlation with performance-approach goal, which significantly correlates with performance-
avoidance goal. The effects of EB on achievement goals are partially supported by the correlation between
them. In addition, self-efficacy has a positive correlation with mastery goal, performance-approach goal, and all
of online learning variables. However, it has a negative correlation with performance-avoidance goal.

Structural Equation Models
For the purpose of this study, one hypothetical model was built representing EB's direct influence on learning
performance, as well as indirect influence through the mediation of motivation variables. I the final model,

CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                          Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

Structural Equation Modeling did not find significant direct relationship between EB and learning performance,
suggesting that EB did not have direct effects on online learning performance. The results corresponded to the
correlation results in Table 2, which suggested no significant correlation between EB and learning performance.
The significant relationships among variables in the final model supported EB's significant influence on online
learning through the mediation of motivation variables. The model had a good fit of the data as indicated by the
Chi-square goodness-of-fit indices (2 = 2828, 2/df = 1.693) being less than 2, indices GFI (.911) being greater
than 0.9, and the RMSEA (.049) falling below 0.05.
        Out of the five EB variables, both omniscient authority ( = -.33, p = .009) and quick learning ( = -
.51, p = .026) had significantly negative effects on mastery goal. Fixed ability significantly predicted both
performance-approach goal ( = .28, p = .043) and performance-avoidance goal ( = .12, p = .029). No other
relationship between EB and goals was detected.
        The relationships between self-efficacy and goals were significant in the final model. Self-efficacy had
significant positive effects on both mastery goal ( = .39, p < .001) and performance-approach goal ( = .23, p =
.041). It also negatively influenced performance-avoidance goal ( = -.42, p < .001). The results were echoed by
the correlation results, which     denoted that self-efficacy  was  positively correlated  with  mastery  goal and
performance-approach     goal while  negatively   correlated with  performance-avoidance   goal. The  relationships
between self-efficacy and online learning participation were also significant. Self-efficacy had significantly
positive effects on both posting participation ( = .36, p = .05) and non-posting participation ( = .50, p = .018).
Self-efficacy did not show significant relationship with perceived learning and class engagement.
        With respect to the relationships between goals and online learning, several significant paths were
found in the resulted model. Mastery goal significantly influenced all of the online learning variables: perceived
learning ( = .43, p < .001), online posting participation ( = .51, p = .004), and online non-posting participation
( = .46, p = .020). All the effects were positive. In addition, performance-avoidance goal had a significantly
negative relationship with perceived learning ( = -.14, p = .041) and non-posting behavior ( = -.22, p = .044).

Discussions and Implications
In this study, we investigated the influence of EB on students' learning and motivation in online settings. SEM
method was used to examine the relationships among these variables.
        First, the results indicated that achievement goals serve as mediators to bridge the relationship between
EB and students' learning performance in CSCL settings. The SEM results indicated no direct relationship
between EB and online learning variables, but suggested that EB had an indirect effect on online learning
participation and perception which was channeled via achievement goals . These results were supported by
previous studies, which suggested that EB may function as implicit theories that influence the adoption of goals
for learning, and these goals can also mediate the relations between EB and cognition and learning performance
(Hofer & Pintrich, 1997), as well as learning approach and achievement (Kizilgunes, et al., 2009).
        Second, the results indicated that different EB systems and students' perceived competence predicted
students' goal orientations in CSCL settings. Particularly, students' beliefs about the speed of learning and
omniscient authority appeared to affect students' mastery goal adoption. The model suggested that students who
believed that learning occurs quickly were less likely to adopt mastery goals, which is inline with previous
studies that found beliefs in quick learning negatively predict mastery goals (e.g., Bråten & Strømsø, 2004). On
the other hand, the model also indicated that those who believed that knowledge came from authority were more
likely to adopt mastery goals. This result contradicts the finding of Bråten and Strømsø's (2004) study, which
found that students who conceived of knowledge as stable and given were less likely to adopt mastery goals.
Besides omniscient authority and quick learning, this study found that perceived competence might function as
an antecedent for all three achievement goals. Furthermore, the results indicated that students' beliefs about
fixed ability to learn influenced their performance goal adoption. Those who believe that the ability to learn was
fixed at birth were more likely to adopt performance goals. Specifically, when students believe their learning
ability is innate and stable, they will be less likely to emphasize competence development and less likely to
foster mastery goals. This finding is in agreement with achievement motivation theories, which suggest that a
mastery goal is characterized by the belief that academic effort will result in an achievement, and in contrast, a
performance goal reflects the belief that ability alone leads to success (Topping & Ehly, 1998). As a result, if
students' perceived competence is high, they tend to adopt performance approach goals and demonstrate their
competence in front of others; if their perceived competence is low, they tend to adopt performance avoidance
goals try to avoid the demonstration of their incompetency in front of others.
        Another   result in   this study shows    that achievement  goals  played a significant  role in predicting
students' perceived learning and their actual learning behaviors in CSCL settings. Mastery goals positively
predicted all the learning  behavior  and  perception   variables, showing  that  students with  mastery goals  are
motivated to learn and engage in CSCL. Performance avoidance goals, however, negatively predicted students'
non-posting   behavior and  perceived    learning in   CSCL  setting. This is  because students  with  performance
avoidance goals tend to avoid failure rather than acquire competence. Instead, they focused more on completing

the minimum  class requirements and     were less likely to participate      in those non-posting  online  learning
activities (e.g., reading, evaluation, etc.) that cannot be observed by teachers and peers.
        This study makes contributions to the literature by moving beyond the self-reported measures
traditional adopted in motivation research and incorporating students' actual participation data in the modeling.
This study also makes contributions to the literature by moving beyond the face-to-face setting and investigating
the relationship among these critical constructs in online learning settings.
        The findings of this study can help education practitioners to understand the lacuna of their current
teaching activities through proper understanding of the effects of EB on students' motivation and online
learning participation and perception. In addition, the mediating effects of goals between EB and learning
performance can provide insights to educators that different teaching strategies or technologies should be
developed to facilitate the study of students with different learning goals.
