          Abstract:   This study reports on the continued development of Common Knowledge (CK) ­ a
          pedagogical   and  technological    innovation   that  supports    knowledge     building  blended
          discourse.  Students use handheld tablets to contribute notes to a community knowledge base,
          which is publicly displayed on the classroom's interactive whiteboard (IWB).       This aggregate
          display provides students with a powerful visualization of the community's idea flow.          The
          IWB display further provides teachers with "at-a-glance" formative assessment of students'
          thinking and supports spontaneous adjustments to their orchestration of inquiry activities and
          blended discourse.  This   paper  presents a study    of how  CK     supports student and  teacher
          discourse in inquiry science.

Introduction & Objectives
A powerful genre of technology for learning involves the capture and representation of student ideas to promote
richer discourse in the classroom, collective inquiry, and the growth of ideas (Hakkarainen, 2004; Scardamalia
& Bereiter, 2006).   This study reports on an innovative technological approach    called Common Knowledge
(CK), where students use handheld tablet technology to contribute notes arising from their science inquiry,
which get dynamically displayed on the classroom's interactive whiteboard (IWB) to facilitate further student-
and teacher-led oral discourse.   This paper describes how CK    supports student reflections and helps teachers
guide collective, idea-centred inquiry in elementary science.

Theoretical Foundations
The present    research is  informed    by the theoretical notion    of classrooms    as   Knowledge   Communities.
Knowledge Building engages student knowledge communities in discursive activity (Scardamalia & Bereiter,
2006), and Knowledge Forum scaffolds asynchronous online discourse (Scardamalia, 2004).             Adding a scripted
inquiry (Raes et al., 2012) dimension to the knowledge community approach, Slotta and his colleagues have
advanced   the  Knowledge   Community      and Inquiry   model   (KCI   - Slotta  &  Najafi, 2012),   where  students
contribute to a collective "knowledge base" which becomes a resource for inquiry activities targeting specific
learning  goals (Peters  &  Slotta, 2010).    KCI provided     a theoretical   perspective for  the present research.
Teachers in this study are veterans of the Knowledge Building approach, which provided further theoretical
grounding for our emerging ideas about blended discourse and knowledge building processes within a smart
classroom's KCI curriculum.
          If language mediates children's thinking and learning (Hicks, 1995), it follows that students working
within a  knowledge   community     use language  (ideas, utterances,   etc) to generate   new  meaning  (Wertsch  &
Smolka, 1994), with interpersonal communication leading to the development of learners' cognition (Sfard,
2007). Thus the role of discourse in teaching and learning may be viewed as social meaning construction - a
necessary  aspect  of children's  conceptual   development,  by    Vygotskyan    accounts. Collaborative  knowledge
construction can occur via asynchronous online discourse and synchronous face-to-face (F2F) oral discourse, if
pedagogically-sound technological and teacher scaffolding are provided (Greeno, 2011; Linn & Slotta, 2006;
Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006).    Several researchers have developed design principles for learning environments
(Engle & Conant, 2002) and orchestration (Penuel et al., 2012) that foster productive spontaneous and ongoing
discourse (Lemke, 2009).    Indeed, a group's online discursive progress emerges from accumulated spontaneous
individual actions (Wise et al., 2012).

Computer-Supported Discourse for Collaborative Learning
A variety of projects have tapped into the potential for technology to script discourse for F2F collaborative
learning. The   Peer  Instruction approach  with  clickers (Crouch   et   al., 2007) uses  a participant structure to
scaffold discourse.  CollPad (Nussbaum et al., 2009) uses Pocket     PC touch devices deliver collaboration scripts

that facilitate             reciprocal     problem    solving.  A   `collaboration  script' is a set   of instructions for how    learners
interact with one another, and how they approach a task (Dillenbourg, 2002).                               These approaches add some
"orchestrational                  load"   to  the teacher, in  terms   of guiding   inquiry    discourse   informed   by their real-time
monitoring   of              the     community's    idea flow,  while   simultaneously   managing      the classroom   and  engaging   in
multiple small group interactions in rapid succession.                       Hence, discussion productivity relies upon a teacher's
talent for  on-the-fly                analysis    and facilitation.  Furthermore,   the approaches     to date do  now   typically allow
learners to access the individual contributions of peers - inhibiting learners from forming a complete picture of
the community's collective idea flow.
          Technological                   advancements     over the  past  2  decades   have   led  to the  development    of  extensible
messaging and presence protocol (XMPP) affording real-time instant messaging and co-authorship (e.g., Google
Docs);  as  well                  as "smart   classroom"   infrastructure  enabling   pedagogically-oriented    scripting  to  support a
distributed array of classroom technologies (Slotta, 2010), for collective and individual inquiry (Raes et al.,
2012).   "Blended learning" has traditionally been defined as the combination of asynchronous online learning
activities with F2F learning (Graham, 2009), and the act of "blending" has been asynchronous until now.                             Our
work leverages these technologies for real-time blending of F2F synchronous online discourse with F2F oral
classroom   discourse                 ­   hence   our term  "synchronously    blended   F2F    discourse".   This project explores the
orchestration of real-time blending of the two discursive modalities. We report on an ongoing program of design
research   (Collins                et al., 2004)   to develop   a   technological  and  pedagogical    innovation  known    as Common
Knowledge (CK), a handheld computer tablet and IWB system enabling student note contribution of questions,
theories,  and              ideas;    and  "tagging"  of these.   Notes   dynamically   appear   on tablets and the    classroom's IWB,
allowing teachers and students to drag notes into topic clusters during oral discussions, swiftly filtering topics as
the  discussion                   progresses.  By   conceptually    connecting  student reflections,   CK   provides   new  pedagogical
opportunities               for    teachers   and students  to  progress  on  their collective  understanding   and    engage  in inquiry
practices.

Method & Data Sources
Data   sources              from      our  classroom    observations  included  field  notes,  video   recordings, teacher  and   student
interviews, and data logs of CK discussions.                        We analyzed the data in terms of teachers' orchestrational and
discursive scaffolds (Fischer & Dillenbourg, 2006; Fong et al., 2012; Prieto et al., 2011).                         Participants were 2
veteran grade 5/6 teachers, `Brad' and `Jen', in a private elementary school located in a large Canadian city,
with 21 and 22 students, respectively (approximately equal numbers of grade 5 and 6 students).                             Brad had been
teaching for 8 years, and Jen for 4 years.                      The  school   has an  emphasis   on  inquiry and   Knowledge   Building
pedagogy.    Students                  were   engaged   in a   broader  inquiry   biodiversity curriculum    ­ WallCology     Embedded
Phenomena ­ within which the present study was deeply integrated.                           In WallCology, students were tasked     with
investigating a virtual `live' ecosystem located within their classroom's walls (Moher & Slotta, 2012). We
integrated CK discussions into this inquiry curriculum, specifying discussion goals (Nussbaum, 2005) and pre-
programming science content and process keyword tags.                          Teachers also launched spontaneous CK discussions,
as they felt warranted.

Findings and Discussion
The goal was to produce a schema for productive inquiry discourse that informs future iterations of CK and the
scripting of its enactment.                   A grounded theory approach was used, to see what orchestrational patterns emerged
from classroom enactments.                     We observed that student CK contributions displayed on the IWB spurred a variety
of  teacher  discourse                 moves.     These moves   were    coded from   video  analysis   using   Fischer &   Dillenbourg's
(Fischer   & Dillenbourg,                    2006)  3   dimensions   of orchestrational  coordination     (cognitive,  pedagogical,  and
technological), as well as a fourth dimension, "curricular", capturing teachers' direct treatment of the subject-
matter content (Figure 1).

Video analysis revealed an ongoing cycle of "Release Redirect Reflect Refocus (4Rs)" orchestration cycle, for
managing synchronous CK and oral discussions. Throughout this cycle, a grounded theory approach to coding
teachers' individual speech turns revealed some prominent discursive moves (Figure 2):                           "Technology
Instruction (TI)", "Solicit Ideas (SI)", "Encourage Hypotheses & Theories (HT)", "Resolve Divergence (RD)",
and "Motivate Alternative Approaches (MA)".

Within the "Reflect" phase of the cycle, teachers' speech turns revealed several types of revoicing or repeating,
paraphrasing, or referring to a student's written or spoken contribution to position students in relation to each
other and  to the                   academic           content (O'Connor   &   Michaels, 1996).     These revoicing  functions included:
Clarification, Norming, Role Casting, Highlight Common Themes, Highlight Unique Perspectives, Connect, and
Relate.

Conclusion & Scientific Significance
Common Knowledge helped to engage students in scientific inquiry processes, and supported a new form of
discourse  within                   the          classroom ­ "synchronously    blended F2F  discourse".     Public visualizations on  the
classroom's IWB of the community's CK notes provided equitable access to at-a-glance formative assessment
of emergent idea trajectories, and enabled the physical grouping of ideas by topic.                            This visualization was a
common referent for topic-focused discourse, and a representation of the knowledge community's distributed
cognition.  These                   orchestration          patterns imply that future iterations of  CK must  include  an  inquiry script
informed by the 4Rs orchestration cycle, to relieve teachers of the cognitive and pedagogical dimensions of
orchestration load. CK improvements should include a collaboration script that will further relieve teachers'
cognitive load, to coordinate student grouping combinations for various stages within this inquiry script.                           It is
our hope that these scripts will facilitate knowledge convergence within a knowledge community.                                On-the-fly
scaffolding could be developed using real-time data mining for smarter filtering and commenting, to address
emergent   common                    themes            and divergent  perspectives within CK     discourse.  Visualization of  idea-note
relationships will further reduce teachers' cognitive load in their efforts to guide productive synchronously
blended inquiry discourse.
