         Abstract:   School   visits to art  museums   are   a  vital  aspect  of art  education  and  cultural
         participation. In this paper we present a CSCL concept designed to encourage students to
         observe closely and reflect on art works in art museums. The concept is based on a multilevel
         perspective on learning in art museums. It is implemented by means of a multi-touch tabletop
         and   a video  tool  with   functions enabling    students    to collaborate   on  processing  digital
         reproductions of art works in small groups during a collaborative visual design task.

Introduction
Visits to arts  museums    and   exhibitions are  a  vital aspect   of arts  education  and cultural  participation (for
indicators of cultural participation, see Morrone, 2006). School visits to arts museums provide access to arts and
high culture for a broad range of children and youth ­ including those coming from family backgrounds where
parents  are not  able to  or not  interested  in visiting  fine  arts museums.    Hence,   school   museum  visits  are
considered particularly suitable occasions for framing participation in public spaces (Nespor, 2000).
         School visits are supported by museums in various ways ­ be it free entrance for school groups, special
guided tours, or high quality educational services for K­12 educators on museum webpages. For example, The
Metropolitan Museum of Art (NY) offers among other services detailed topic-specific lesson plans that relate
explicitly to the National Visual Arts Standards and comprise suggestions for advanced learning activities to
explore and reflect on art objects in the museum's collections (1).
         Targeting the intersection of museum and school education, we propose in this paper a CSCL concept
to support analysis and interpretation of art works during school visits to fine arts museums. Specifically, we
investigate a concept that fosters students' close observation and reflection of art works, while sustaining the
experiential flavor of the museum visit (cf. Duke, 2010). It is implemented by means of a multi-touch tabletop
(MTT) and a video tool for collaborative visual design tasks in small groups. The concept has been developed
through close interdisciplinary cooperation of psychologists, computer scientists and museum educators. Our
work is based on our previous CSCL research which shows that advanced digital technologies offer specific
opportunities for fostering knowledge construction and learning during collaborative design activities (e.g.,
Zahn,  Pea,  Hesse,  &  Rosen,   2010)  and   for knowledge    communication      in  museums  (Knipfer,  Mayr,   Zahn,
Schwan, & Hesse, 2009). It is also firmly rooted in related CSCL perspectives, assuming multiple levels of
learning ranging from individuals to communities, and assuming small group interaction to be the primary unit
that mediates between individual learning and community learning (Engeström, 1999; G. Stahl, Koschmann, &
Suthers,  2006;  G.  Stahl, 2006).   In the  following     sections we    will describe the  theoretical and    technical
underpinnings    of our   concept.   We  will  first review    curricular    and  museum    educational  requirements.
Subsequently, we will elaborate on how the collaborative visual design approach backed by MTT hardware can
meet these requirements. The tool's implementation and functionality will be described thereafter.

Theoretical Framework
K­12 visual art education and museum educational goals
Among the most important skills which should and can be learned in visual art education, are the analysis and
interpretation of visual material (National Art Education Association, 1994; Winner, 2007). In this respect,
Winner (2007) differentiates between observation and reflection. Observation encompasses attending to aspects
and details  of  works  of  art, especially  when   they   are not  obvious.   Reflection  refers to activities such as
questioning,  explaining  and  evaluating   one's own  works    and    those of  others (Winner,  2007). For    example,
students may "explain what some part of their drawing depicted, how they had achieved a certain effect, why
they had made something the way they did, and what changes they were planning in their work" (Winner, 2007,
p. 28; italics in original). In addition to these academic learning objectives, museum educators stress the point
that the museum visit provides an opportunity to have unique (aesthetic) experiences (cf. Pekarik, Doering, &

CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                            Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

Karns, 1999) and to learn from those experiences beyond the "right answer paradigm" (Duke, 2010, p. 271). In
this way, Barrett (2008) emphasizes the importance of multi-perspectivity in the interpretation of works of art.
Such a    constructivist approach     to  museum    education  is in  line with  the    current   trend   toward shifting
interpretative power from authorities like curators and art historians to the common visitors (cf. Barrett, 2008;
Hooper-Greenhill, 2000; Trant, 2006). In the specific case of school group visits, the goals of academic visual
arts education and museum education coincide in a collaborative learning situation. The specific challenge is to
support such collaborative learning in fine arts exhibitions showing inestimable and untouchable (!) original art
works.
          We argue here from a CSCL perspective that advanced media applications in museums are suitable for
supporting close observation and reflection, as well as active and collaborative learning (cf. Knipfer et al.,
2009). More specifically, we argue that learning through collaborative visual design with digital video tools is a
promising approach for meeting those requirements in a fine arts museum. In the following sections we will
explain why.

Supporting observation and reflection in the art museum ­ a CSCL concept
Building on CSCL theory (e.g., Engeström, 1999; G. Stahl et al., 2006; G. Stahl, 2006), we develop our concept
for school class visits in a fine arts museum according to the following framework:
          We    assume   a multilevel     structure of  observation   and   reflection  in    a   museum    environment
distinguishing five levels: (i) a cognitive level, where observation and reflection of art works is performed by
the individual student in front of an original art work in "silent dialogue", guided by individual knowledge and
information  processing    abilities (cf. Leder, Belke, Oeberst,   &  Augustin,  2004).    (ii) a socio-cognitive   level,
where observation and reflection is a collaborative activity of two or more students engaging in what Pea (2006,
p. 1332) termed the "look-notice-comment cycle (LNC)" ­ the iterative sequence of observing, directing another
person's attention and commenting (Pea, 2006). In these cycles, one person's observation becomes the starting
point for a discussion, which in turn leads to further discoveries and interpretations by other group members and
so forth. (iii) a  socio-constructivist   or: small group level,  where    the whole    process   of  the students'  joint
observation and reflection is held and supported by a task structure, which transforms those processes into a
lasting artifact, mediated by technological affordances (cf. Suthers & Hundhausen, 2003). (iv) a class level,
where observation and reflection and their manifestation in students' group products (artifacts) form a collective
museum experience that is guided by curricular goals and standards (cf. National Art Education Association,
1994) and moderated by the teacher. (v) a socio-cultural or: community level, where observation and reflection
consist of a museum's contextualized activities for knowledge building (Scardamalia, 2002), e.g., collecting,
storing and presenting art works as cultural heritage, and providing for constant dialogues between artists and
viewers/visitors mediated by expert curators.
          We assume the five levels in our art educational concept for school class visits in a fine arts museum as
being connected by small group student interaction. In accordance with related CSCL research, we thus put
small groups at the core of the concept: Small group interaction is the primary unit that mediates between the
multiple levels ranging from individual learning to community learning (G. Stahl et al., 2006; G. Stahl, 2006).
Specifically, we suggest that learning through collaborative visual design (Zahn, Krauskopf, Hesse, & Pea,
2010) is a task that connects individual cognition to participation in knowledge building (Zahn, Krauskopf,
Hesse, & Pea, 2009). By accomplishing design tasks together, students are cognitively active, they collaborate
and they produce new knowledge products for the community ­ thereby deepening their own knowledge and
adding to  the  community    knowledge.     Moreover,   collaborative visual   design   is in   line with curricular and
museum educational needs: It is suitable for fostering observation and reflection skills and ­ as a constructivist
approach ­ it is capable of sustaining the experiential flavor of the museum visit.
          In order to allow students to learn through collaborative visual design in the art museum of the 21st
century, it is crucial to provide for hardware and software solutions, which are not only appropriate for the task
(cf. Pea, 2006; Zahn, Pea, et al., 2010) but also meet the special requirements of a museum environment (cf.
Hinrichs, Schmidt, & Carpendale, 2008; Jacucci et al., 2010). In search of appropriate hardware that can support
a collaborative design task in the museum, we explore the potential of MTTs, which have already made their
way into many museums. In terms of software, we rely on digital video tools that have a tradition of being used
for observation and analysis skills development, including those from our own research (e.g., Goldman, 2004,
2007; Pea, 2006; Salomon, 1974; Spiro, Coulson, Feltovich, & Anderson, 1994; Zahn, Pea, et al., 2010).

Providing task structures for school group visits: Learning through collaborative visual design
Our concept builds on the learning through collaborative design approach for small groups of students (similar
to learning through design, Kafai & Resnick, 1996). For decades, computer supported design tasks have been
successfully implemented in schools (Harel, 1990; Kafai & Ching, 2001; Kafai & Resnick, 1996; Kolodner et
al., 2003; Lehrer, Erickson, & Connell, 1994; Papert & Harel, 1991). Studies investigating collaborative visual
design tasks    in the domain  of    history  have  repeatedly shown   how     students acquire   substantial historical

CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                              Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

knowledge and visual skills when they design websites for a virtual history museum, using a historical newsreel
and advanced video editing tools in their history lesson (Zahn, Krauskopf, et al., 2010; Zahn, Pea, et al., 2010).
The conceptual underpinnings of the collaborative visual design approach have been described in earlier CSCL,
JLS and iJCSCL papers (Zahn, Pea, et al., 2010; Zahn et al., 2005; Zahn, Krauskopf, Hesse, & Pea, 2011, 2012).
The basic assumption is that visual design leads to a deep and meaningful engagement with content, since it
links people, form and content in a combined design space. People engaging in a collaborative design task have
to negotiate not only the content (what should be designed) but also the form (how it should be designed for a
specific audience; cf. Harel, 1990; Kafai & Ching, 2001), while coordinating their collaborative process at the
same time (Zahn et al., 2012). In this sense, collaborative design constitutes a form of complex problem solving
that is distributed over the cognitive systems of different people in a joint problem space (Zahn, Krauskopf, et
al., 2010; cf. Roschelle & Teasley, 1995).

Providing digital tools with socio-constructivist potential: Multi-touch tabletop technology
Our    concept includes  the  use  of a multi-touch     tabletop  system   (see Figure    1).  Multi-touch  tabletops are
horizontal displays that allow simultaneous interaction of several people by touch input (Harris et al., 2009).
They have received a lot of attention recently ­ not only by museums around the world, which incorporate
MTTs in their visitor information systems and exhibits (e.g., Correia, Mota, Nóbrega, Silva, & Almeida, 2010;
Geller, 2006; Hornecker, 2008), but also from the CSCL community (cf. Dillenbourg & Evans, 2011; Higgins,
Mercier, Burd, & Hatch, 2011): MTTs are assumed to afford a more collaborative and constructivist working
mode, thereby favorably suited for learning activities (cf. Kaplan et al., 2009). Dillenbourg & Evans (2011, p.
491) have characterized this as the "socio-constructivist flavor" of tabletops. The authors identify four key
features, which may set MTTs apart from other computing devices in terms of their potential as learning tools:
MTTs are designed for (i) co-located (ii) multiple users, who interact with each other via (iii) multiple forms of
communication (i.e. gestures, talk, and actions), while primarily engaging in (iv) hands-on problem solving
activities (i.e. manipulation   of   virtual objects).  Building   on  this  socio-constructivist    potential and  their
increasing availability in museums, we consider MTTs to be promising candidates as tools for learning through
visual design in museum art education. As a matter of fact, MTTs have already been used as a basis for design
and video editing tasks (e.g., de Sa, Shamma, & Churchill, 2012; Rick, Rogers, Haig, & Yuill, 2009; Warnecke,
Dohrmann, Jürgens, Rausch, & Pinkwart, 2011). However, as Dillenbourg & Evans (2011, p. 500) point out,
although   the medium   may     lend itself  to a certain use,   the technology    itself does  not  have  any "intrinsic
pedagogical effects". Whether or not a device can be utilized as an effective learning tool depends mainly on the
respective  task  and   on  the conditions   of   its usage.   As we   intend   to illustrate  below,  learning  through
collaborative visual design offers a framework that allows for meaningful tasks which make full use of the
MTTs' socio-constructivist potential.

Providing digital tools to support observation, analysis and reflection
Research in the learning sciences has provided ample evidence for using digital video technology to support a
variety of socio-cognitive functions. Since early research on the educational value of films, where Salomon
(1974) found that filmic coding elements can facilitate individual students' mastery of mental skills necessary to
attend to details of art works, video was repeatedly suggested as a tool for observation, analysis and reflection
(Goldman, 2004, 2007; Pea, 2006; Pea et al., 2004; Spiro et al., 1994). It was shown in experiments how
different  video  tools influence    collaborative    epistemic activities (grounding,    negotiation, comparison     and
interpretation   processes) for students    using those  video  tools (e.g., Zahn,   Pea,   et al., 2010):  Results from
different studies show that the affordances of specific video tools (e.g., WebDiverTM, Pea et al., 2004) better
support learners' interactions in making them more productive, compared to interactions performed with simple
technological solutions. The results were improvements in learning outcomes and observation abilities (Zahn,
Pea, et al., 2010). A field study further revealed that the differences in learners' interactions persist in the real,
"noisy" history classroom with 16-year old students (e.g., Zahn, Krauskopf, et al., 2010). In these studies it was
the student's task, to design a website for a virtual history museum, based on their analysis and decomposition
of an original newsreel about the 1948 Berlin Blockade. In their products, the students reflected and commented
upon the different camera and cutting techniques and the respective effects that these techniques evoked. Yet
there are no studies available concerning the use of advanced video tools in art education or in art museums.

Learning through collaborative visual design in the art museum

The task concept
Derived from our multilevel CSCL framework, we have developed the following task structure: During a school
visit, students  individually browse   the   museum's    collection  (cognitive  level,   see above),  guided  by an  art
educational group task (for possible tasks see scenario below and table 1), and collect digital reproductions of
art works   from  the museum     space  (community      level)  using smartphones.   The      reproductions then  can  be

© ISLS                                                                                                                59
CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                          Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

transferred to the MTT and processed by means of a video tool in order to produce a video clip in each group
(socio-constructivist or small group level, see above). Thereby, students discuss with other students, which
reproductions should be selected and how they should be further processed in the video clip production (socio-
cognitive level). The clip will eventually be saved, which enables classmates, teachers or other people to share,
discuss and enrich the product (class and community level).
        In the next section, we will elaborate more deeply on how students will be supported during video clip
production  through  socio-cognitive   tool functions.   The task workflow    is depicted  in Figure  1.   For details
regarding the general design task structure please refer to Zahn, Krauskopf, Hesse, & Pea     (2010).

Implementation of socio-cognitive functions in the MTT video editing tool
We  implemented    specific  video  functions  to support  observation  and   reflection (socio-cognitive    level, see
above). The video functions consist of three basic socio-cognitive functions that are based on related research in
cognitive psychology and the learning sciences: counterfactual image manipulations, highlighting of aspects
within images, and linking images to create sequences. All functions constitute epistemic actions, as described
by Kirsh and Maglio (1994). Counterfactual image manipulations are image modifications based on digital
imaging filters, which change an image's formal appearance; for instance, a painting's strong light and dark
contrasts can be changed to more subtle lighting differences and vice versa (see example scenario below).
Counterfactual  image   manipulations    were  implemented    in  accordance  with  the  concept  of  counterfactual
thinking (e.g., Byrne, 2005) and the understanding of manipulations as cues to causality (cf. Woodward, 2005).
We assume the following: Because generating mental alternatives to reality (counterfactual thinking) can assist
people in thinking about the causes of effects and events (causal reasoning; e.g., Spellman & Mandel, 1999),
creating alternatives to visual material (counterfactual image manipulations) can help to reflect upon the causes
of  certain visual effects. We    implement  a tool based    strategy  here, since  it can be   difficult to  mentally
manipulate   a painting (i.e. to  create a  counterfactual   painting; cf. Brandimonte,    Hitch, &   Bishop,   1992;
Chambers & Reisberg, 1985). So far, four specific image filters have been implemented in our tool: Saturation,
lightness, color temperature and vertical orientation (reversal of left/right orientation). For possible filter uses
see Table   1. Highlighting   is  a well-known    function that  helps to  bring  out  specific features   of (visual)
information. This function has already been investigated in detail with respect to arts education (cf. Salomon,
1974) and implemented in video analysis tools (Pea et al., 2004). Figure 1e shows an example of a highlighting
function: An important detail of an art work is marked by a freehand drawing tool. Other planned functions
contain spotlight, zoom and text annotation functionalities. Linking images to create new sequences is a tool
function known from hypertext and hypervideo tools research in the learning sciences (Spiro & Jehng, 1990; E.
Stahl & Bromme, 2004; Zahn & Finke, 2003). In our tool, reproductions of paintings can be linked to compose a
slideshow, thereby facilitating, for example, comparisons regarding content, epoch, style and artist. For instance,
the linking function offers a convenient way to tell the history of portrait painting or to give an overview of
variations  on the  same    motif throughout   different epochs.  The   activity of linking   images  creates   (new)
connections among them. We assume that this leads to mental integration and, finally, to building respective
knowledge structures.
        According to our CSCL concept for supporting school visits to art museums, and as a basis for further
research, we develop example learning scenarios in cooperation with a fine arts museum in Germany (2).

Example Scenario: Light and Shadow
Let's say that an advanced art class visits a fine arts museum in order to study the effects of different light-
shadow techniques. In order to learn about the use of light in art, the teacher asks the arts class to accomplish a
collaborative visual design task to compare the effects of strong light-dark contrasts (a technique known as
chiaroscuro) to more subtle light-dark contrasts. Students are divided into two groups. Each group will be
encouraged to focus on one technique (chiaroscuro vs. subtle contrasts) and to "collect" digital reproductions of
appropriate art works with smartphones while browsing the museum's exhibition (see 1b). After returning to the
MTT, the students can transfer their collected art works to the MTT and discuss in small groups which of them
should be included in the video clip (see Figure 1c). Following this selection phase, the students will start the
video editing (cf. Figure 1e). They use different image filters in order to find out how the appearance and the art
work's effect will change due to alteration of contrast and lightness: Shifting an image towards a strong light-
dark contrast   evokes  a chiaroscuro with   dramatic appeal, while   a reduction  creates   the opposite  effect. If
necessary, images can be annotated with short texts. Parallel to the editing, the students can decide on the
sequence (cf. Figure 1d) in which the art works will be presented within the clip. A playback function enables
the users to preview and revise their work. Subsequent to the editing phase, the students can save the clip.
Finally, the clip will be made accessible through the museum's website and can be used for further discussion in
class. The described scenario is just one example, for other possible applications please refer to Table 1. Also
please note: The examples provide only a basis for supporting teachers and museum staff, who will decide on
how the tool will be integrated in a particular school visit. Under ideal conditions, a specific learning scenario
could be prepared in class, played out in the museum using the MTT and reinforced, again, in class. Art teachers
can  also invent different tool-based scenarios,  which allow  for  a more  spontaneous     use  of the  tool on-site.
Moreover ­ after careful reviewing by museum staff ­ successful user-generated scenarios will be provided at
the MTT for other visitors, thereby establishing a scenario database to be used in the long run.

Table 1. Examples for topics and possible scenarios supported by MTT and video editing tool.

 Topic              Possible scenario and technology support (MTT video editing)
 Light and          Students tell the history of shadow depiction in visual art (cf. Gombrich, 1995) in a video
 shadow             clip, or they illustrate the difference between cast and attached shadows (cf. Jacobson &
                    Werner, 2004) with different reproductions.
 Details/Motifs     Students look out for art works with interesting but less obvious details (e.g., symbols,
                    motifs). They collect them and use highlighting functions to bring out the details in digital
                    reproduction of the art works. By linking images in a slideshow, students recognize the
                    same motif in art works across different artists, styles, epochs etc.
 Composition        Students identify the compositional structure of a painting: They test hypotheses regarding
                    the   composition  by  sketching  overlays  directly   on  the  reproduction.     By  flipping
                    reproductions horizontally, students can learn about the importance of left-right orientation
                    in paintings (cf. Bennett, Latto, Bertamini, Bianchi, & Minshull, 2010; Zaidel & Fitzgerald,
                    1994).
 Color              Students collect reproductions of particular warm and cold colored paintings and discuss
                    how a change in color temperature affects the impression and meaning of these paintings.

Discussion and Outlook
In this paper we have presented a multilevel CSCL concept for learning through collaborative visual design with
an MTT based advanced video editing tool that can be adopted in fine arts museums to foster the observation
and reflection required in academic art education. Our concept constitutes a method that can be tailored to
further topics  and  learning objectives. Although  the learning   through  visual design    method   is empirically
validated, the present concept warrants further research: In a next step we intend to investigate the concept and
the tool within a sample scenario. For further experimental research, multilevel approaches will be considered.
Notwithstanding future research, in our view the concept proposed in this paper offers at least three advantages
for museum    and curricular  art education: (i) Museums  and   schools   are both social   places  which  serve   an
educational purpose ­ our CSCL concept can account for that fact by supporting "21st century collaborative
learning". (ii)  The educational   concept  meets  both  curricular   and museum    educational     requirements.  It
complements other art educational strategies and is highly adaptable to specific learning goals. (iii) Building on
the high popularity of interactive displays among young adults (cf. nielsenwire, 2012), the present concept may
help to bridge the gap between young students and old masters through new media. However, some curators are
concerned that digital media could actually hinder appropriate art appreciation. Since this concern is justified in
certain cases (cf. Hsi, 2003), it should be deliberated whether the use of a certain technology offers an added
value (cf. Buder, 2007). As original paintings cannot be altered, annotated or even viewed from close distances,
