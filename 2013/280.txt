        Abstract: In this paper, Gartner Group's Hype Cycle is used as the basis for categorizing and
        analyzing research on the educational use of ubiquitous computing. There are five stages of
        the Hype Cycle: technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment,
        slope of enlightenment,  and   plateau of productivity.  The   first decade   of  research  on  the
        educational use of mobile technology is divided in this paper into four stages: (i) a period of
        mobility and personal digital assistants; (ii) the era of wireless Internet learning devices; (iii)
        the introduction  of social  mobile media;  and   (iv) a ubiquitous   future.    In addition, three
        empirical case studies are used as examples of these developmental stages. These case studies
        demonstrate   the  diversity of contexts,   methods,   and technologies    used,     ranging  from
        workplace to nature trail, from inquiry learning to collaborative knowledge building, and from
        PocketPCs to smartphones.

Introduction
The evolving role of smartphones, Internet tablets, and other mobile devices in our everyday life is an example
of ubiquitous computing, a term coined by Weiser (1991), who wrote that "the most profound technologies are
those that  disappear  [because t]hey   weave  themselves  into  the   fabric  of everyday     life  until they are
indistinguishable from it" (p. 94). Weiser is widely considered to be the father of ubiquitous computing, an
environment in which the computer is integral to but embedded in the background of daily life.
        In this paper, Gartner Group's Hype Cycle is used as the basis for categorizing and analyzing research
on the educational use of ubiquitous computing because the Hype Cycle characterizes the typical progression of
an emerging technology. As depicted (Figure 1), there are five stages of the Hype Cycle: technology trigger,
peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity.
Because the technology is at different levels of development during each of the five portions of the cycle,
research into the educational use of the technologies can be made in steps. These steps are not linear in the
strictest sense; rather, they follow the steps of the development of research in the field. In this paper, the Hype
Cycle is also used to structure an examination of the development of the general idea of mobile computer-
supported  learning. This is achieved by adding   a layer of   several megatrends   in    the technology-enhanced
learning field on top of the Hype Cycle (shown at the top of Figure 1) (O' leary, 2008).

In addition to analysis of the general idea of mobile devices in education, three empirical case studies are
included in this paper as examples of the developmental stages. These case studies demonstrate the diversity of
contexts, methods, and technologies used, ranging from workplace to nature trail, from inquiry learning to
collaborative knowledge building, and from PocketPCs to smartphones. The methodological and technological
choices made in these case studies have enabled examination of the nature of social interaction in small-group
settings supported with     ubiquitous  technologies   in three  different  contexts      with different  needs  for data
collection and analysis.

First years of research on the educational use of ubiquitous computing: Mobility and
PDA(s)
The history of the educational use of ubiquitous computing begins with the era of technology triggers (stage 1),
including the product launches by Apple Newton, Palm Pilot, and Nokia Communicator in the late 1990s,
followed by Microsoft's PocketPC in the early 2000s. Later devices are considered first-generation gadgets in
this cycle. These early developments in ubiquitous communication led to a peak of inflated expectations (stage
2) when some scholars thought that mobile devices would revolutionize education (Trifonova, 2003). It was
typical during this period to refer to the educational use of mobile devices under the terms "mobile learning"
and "m-learning" (Keegan, 2005; Park, 2011; Quinn, 2000).
         The idea  of   mobile    learning  was presented  by Sharples  (2000),   who       said that  new technological
affordances  enabled    a "new    genre of  educational   technology--personal    (handheld      or  wearable)  computer
systems that support learning from any location throughout a lifetime." The various educational affordances of
wireless technologies suggested by researchers thus far (Roschelle & Pea, 2002) have paved the way for the
emergence of so-called mobile learning or ubiquitous learning initiatives, such as G1:1 learning (Chan et al.,
2006). While  some   researchers   elaborate  terms   deeply in  scientific practices,     many  still understand mobile
devices and wireless networking technologies in education as "an extension of e-learning" (Quinn, 2000) or the
mainstream, pervasive learning delivery medium. However, these simplistic views ignore the fact that modern
education and pedagogy puts a high value on active, productive, creative, and collaborative learning methods
that go far beyond the absorption of codified information (Hoppe, Joiner, Milrad, & Sharples, 2003).

Case study 1: Designing a new virtual master's program in the context of a distance
education network
This  study was conducted      in realistic settings with the University    Learning       Center, which  offers distance
education on information processing sciences through several retraining programs in seven independent regional
learning centers. The voluntary participants (N = 10) were split into three teams at two different locations in a
northern area of Finland. The participants (nine men and one woman) comprised four project managers, a
lecturer, a computer specialist, an educational designer, and three new media designers. All participants had
previous experience in working together in the same distributed organization.

                                   Figure 2. Instructional design of the first case study

In this case study (Laru & Järvelä, 2008), the participants shared a major problem, which was to design a new
distance education master's program in a new domain (see Figure 2). The instructional design in this first case
study  was  simplified:   a knowledge-building   tool  was  just embedded    into existing     practices. To   design the
program,   participants   were offered  a   mobilized version   of collaborative  technology       (FLE3mobile)   with  a

© ISLS                                                                                                                281
CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                       Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

dialogue model of knowledge building at their disposal. Ideas of knowledge building and progressive inquiry
learning were operationalized in sentence openers. At the pedagogical level, participants were free to collaborate
as they desired while designing the program.

Appearance of first wireless Internet learning devices together with pedagogically
ambitious learning goals
In the third stage, that of disillusionment, critical accounts toward technology determinism started to appear. A
considerable amount of research effort in this decade was driven by technological challenges, and few studies
dealt with questions of how meaningful and productive mobile technology-supported (collaborative) learning
actually is (Järvelä, Näykki, Laru, & Luokkanen, 2007; Park, 2011). These concerns are explicitly enumerated
in an extensive review of mobile learning projects by Frohberget et al. (2009), where the authors argue that "tool
support of most projects is not pedagogically ambitious, [and] a strong minority provide tools that aim at
realizing higher pedagogical goals" (p. 317).
       In   order to ensure   engaged learners,  a proper pedagogical or    lesson design       is needed  for when
enthusiasm for using the new technologies begins to wear out (Looi et al., 2009). Yet, although many scholars,
most notably Roschelle and Pea (2002), have predicted tensions between traditional learning models, which are
highly centralized, and emerging pedagogical ideas amplified with mobile technologies, which are naturally
situated, collaborative, and distributed, educational technologists tend to create applications that are designed to
work within "inherited educational ideas rather than transform them" (Squire & Dikkers, 2012). Roschelle and
Pea (2002)   also predicted how  mobile  technology   might  revolutionize  the role of        teachers by breaking
contrastive teaching paradigms  of "sage on    the stage" (teacher-centered  instruction)      and  "guide by  side"
(teacher-guided discovery). Instead, they offered the idea of "conductor of performances," which has been
further developed by other scholars (Dillenbourg & Jermann, 2010) using the term "orchestration" to describe
run-time adjustments in complex socio-technical designs that include multiple social planes in different contexts
mediated by multiple devices.

Case Study II: Field trip to a nature park in a wilderness forest setting in the context of
informal K-12 education
The participants in the second case study were primary school students (N = 22, all 12 years of age) who
participated in a one-day learning project during a field trip to a nature park in a wilderness forest setting in
northern Finland. The field trip activities in this case study were designed and developed by the research team in
collaboration with the nature park's local expert, a biologist. The students were randomly assigned to eight
groups (six triads and two dyads), and each group was provided with a mobile phone. Before the experiment, the
principles and procedures of collaborative inquiry learning and argumentation were presented, and practical
training for the fieldtrip was given in the classroom by the researchers and the biologist.

                                       Figure 3. Instructional design of the second case study

The major problem in this study was to explore inanimate and animate traces of nature in small groups in order
to create argumentative knowledge claim messages (Laru, Järvelä, & Clariana, 2012). This study is an example
of a teacher-led outdoor learning activity in which students learn in groups within confined time periods, which
is a subtype of "formal learning in informal settings" (Wong & Looi, 2011).

CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                              Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

          From the perspective of instructional design (see Figure 3), a collaborative core activity was aimed at
scaffolding co-construction of argumentative discussions in small groups during inquiry learning. It consisted of
"soft" scaffolding, provided by tutors and the nature guide, and "hard" argumentation scaffolds, provided by the
messaging tool (sentence openers). In addition, the instructional design included pre-structuring activities that
provided    procedural  scaffolding  in  the  form    of storyboard   messages    (Laru   et al.,  2012) as  well  as post-
structuring  activities that  included      debriefing activities  such as  a    review   and comparison     phase  in the
collaborative and conclusive synthesis at the end of each task at the collective level.

Era of social mobile learning: Combining affordances of social software and mobile
learning
The developments described for the previous phase, together with new affordances of mobile technologies, led
to the Hype Cycle stage of enlightenment (Figure 1). The affordances provided by the combination of mobile
devices and social software tools led us into a new phase in the evolution of technology enhanced learning, one
that forges new learning spaces and continuity between pedagogical phases of the instructional design (Laru,
Näykki, & Järvelä, 2012; Multisilta & Milrad, 2009; Wong & Looi, 2011). In practice, the increasing use of
mobile   social media   in  education    is stitching  learners' formal   and informal    learning contexts  together  and
bridging individual and social learning, which leads to seamless learning.
          However, most papers considered in the extensive literature review made by Wong and Looi (2011)
tend to discuss or analyze personalized and social learning in their studies separately or to only focus on one of
these  aspects. Further,    very few  papers   discuss   the   mechanisms     of bridging    individual  and collaborative
activities. The third case study in the current paper is focused on bridging individual and collaborative activities
as well as face-to-face and mobile social media activities. It includes a full activity design, as suggested by
Wong and Looi (2011), with multiple phases; the mobile-mediated conceptualization activity was just one phase
of the instructional design. Products created in that phase can be characterized as artifacts that were used as a
mediating tool for reflections, elaborations, reviews, and knowledge building (Wong & Looi, 2011).

Case Study III: Future scenarios and technologies in learning: A course in the context of
higher education
For the   third case   study, the research    participants    were 21  undergraduate      students in a  five-year teacher
education program at the Faculty of Education in the University of Finland. All students were enrolled in a
required course entitled Future Scenarios and Technologies in Learning during the spring semester of 2009. The
21 participants comprised 16 women (76%) and 5 men (24%). The prevalence of women reflected the gender
ratio of education majors at the university. The mobile phone-mediated activities in this course are an example
of course-related activities outside of the normal class hours, such as artifact creation in daily life (largely
incidental  encounters  or  improvisations),    which    is another  subtype  of  formal   learning   in informal  settings
(Wong & Looi, 2011).

                                   Figure 4. Instructional design of the third case study

In  this case   study,  the same  content     was  elaborated    multiple times   when    students  encountered    multiple
representations  of    each of   the content   topics    (six altogether)  using   different  analogues,   examples,   and
metaphors. In other words, the instructional design required students to revisit "the same material, at different
times,   in rearranged  contexts,    for different purposes      and from  different conceptual     perspectives"  (Spiro,

© ISLS                                                                                                                 283
CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                           Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

Feltovich, Jacobson, & Coulson, 1991, p. 28). From the perspective of ill-structured problems and tasks, the
students split one problem into multiple smaller problem-solving tasks as phases in the instructional design
proceeded.
         In this experiment, the learners' core task was to integrate selected individual blog reflections and
visual representations into coherent and a comprehensive wiki (see Figure 4). Although this wiki was also the
main outcome of the activity (the end goal for their activities), it was not specified as such. There were also
multiple individual and collective phases before the wiki activity, and the goals for these were not specified
either.
         The students needed to make choices in three phases concerning their learning objectives aimed at
solving ill-structured problems, thus:

      1. Reflection (collaborative): After a  grounding    lecture in  which students discussed  the lecture  topic in
        groups and formulated a problem to be solved during the following individual learning phases;
      2. Conceptualization  (individual):  Following   the reflection  phase, which   included  an activity  in which
        students were required to conceptualize their group members' shared interests (i.e., shared problem); this
        task can be considered as a standalone ill-structured task that led students to qualitative modeling in order
        to reformulate group-level problems;
      3. Knowledge   co-construction   (collaborative):  An  assigned   task  focused   on   integrating each group's
        selected blog entries and photos into a cohesive and comprehensive group wiki; this activity could not be
        conducted without qualitative modeling to reformulate shared learning objectives and problems, because
        individual activities affected the shared objectives and problems.
The instructional design of the third experiment enabled students to make comparisons between the cases. This
was   done both   in face-to-face  activities and   with the help   of technological  tools. The activities involving
comparison comprised two phases:

      1. Reflection and elaboration (individual): After individual conceptualization, students were required to
        analyze photos taken using mobile phones in order to discard ideas that were not relevant to their groups'
        shared learning objectives; they were also required to write blog entries on selected photos, in which they
        further elaborated   associations  between   the   photos, group-level  objectives,  and students'    everyday
        situated practices (note: students were able to see photos taken and blog entries written by other students
        and in other groups by monitoring their activities using an RSS reader);
      2. Review and evaluation (collaborative): After individual reflection and elaboration, students were tasked
        with reviewing group members' blogs and evaluating the usefulness of blog entries in the context of their
        shared learning objectives.

Ubiquitous tomorrow: Learning environment consisting of an amalgam of tools
around the corner
From the present perspective, this field of research is currently in the phase of the plateau of productivity. The
world is entering the Age of Mobilism (Norris & Soloway, 2011). Ubiquitous computing has evolved from
Weiser's initial ideas about the interplay between the human world and communication technologies with the
widespread  adoption    of  mobile   devices  that require proactive   involvement rather  than the  calm   computing
originally suggested    by  Weiser.  Mobile   phones   have  grown     beyond a tool  for  conversations,  to become
connected computing devices that offer a multitude of services and which currently are perceived as much more
than just phones, having also developed into movie players, gaming platforms, cameras, etc. (Pea & Maldonado,
2006).  Current     trends are   increasingly focusing   on  effective  personal   learning  environments    as being
characterized by an amalgam of technology devices, software, and services; access to a variety of digital tools
simultaneously for everyone, anywhere, anytime; and choices about which technology is most appropriate in a
given   situation (van't   Hooft &   Swan,   2007). In  many  techno-centric  papers  on   context-aware   technology,
previous killer features--contemporary human/computer interaction paradigms (RFID tags, QR-Codes, GPS,
etc.)--are fast becoming regarded as mainstream in current mobile devices. Timely, contextualized information
afforded by these can serve as evidence to support partially formed ideas and misunderstandings and to trigger
comparison with previously stored data on the device, as well as to support an inquiry process or dialogue in
situ. Actually,   these affordances   are enabling   the preparation   of instructional designs  based   on the  ideas
suggested a decade ago (Roschelle & Pea, 2002).
         Western students today may have "one or more devices per student" if needed, but the number of
devices in the ubiquitous environment is quite variable. Indeed, device-to-user ratios range from the use of

© ISLS                                                                                                            284
CSCL 2013 Proceedings                                                               Volume 1: Full Papers & Symposia

multiple computing devices (like sensors) by one student (10:1) to a class of students with one interactive
whiteboard (1:all), and encompass the in-between usage scenarios of 1:1 (as G1:1 initiative members originally
suggested), 1:2 (as in pair work sharing a device), and 1:4 (as in small-group work discussions mediated by a
shared device) (Dillenbourg, 2010 in Wong & Looi, 2011). These device-user ratios set new challenges for
instructional designers, because each ratio provides different dynamics of interaction and collaboration (Wong
& Looi, 2011).
          In other words, different device-student ratios are an example of converged cognitive tools that we
unconsciously and effortlessly use for achieving the benefits of distributed intelligence (Pea & Maldonado,
2006). From an educational perspective, this is a part of an environment in which "all students have access to a
variety of digital devices and services, including computers connected to the Internet and mobile computing
devices, whenever and wherever they need them" (van't Hooft, Swan, & Cook, 2007, p. 6). It is also line with
the tenets of constructivism insofar as it involves a learning environment in which both teachers and students are
active participants in the learning processes (critically analyzing information, creating new knowledge in a
variety  of ways,   communicating      what  they   have  learnt)  mediated  by  tools  they   have chosen  and   that are
appropriate for particular tasks (Dabbagh & Kitsantas, 2011).

Discussion
Overall, decades of research in the field of educational use of ubiquitous computing and rapid technological
evolution   (both  described  in  Figure  1)  illustrates the rich field of  business  and  research  opportunities.   Van
Lente, Spitters, and Peine (2013) have argued that hypes thrive in rich environments, where research, business,
and wider social activities contribute to the creation, sharing, and refinement of expectations. This paper follows
studies conducted by Järvenpää and Mäkinen (2008) and van Lente et al. (2013), which have bridged empirical
measures    to the  Hype    Cycle. Our    paper represents    an   exploratory and   empirically    driven study  seeking
indicators in the three case study designs for the Hype Cycle in relation to the evolution of educational use of
ubiquitous computing.
          The Hype Cycle and case studies described here emphasize that pedagogically grounded instructional
design is needed in order to put emergent technologies into effective use. The employment of mobile devices,
including mobile phones and tablets, is a growing trend in education. The practice has been widely technology-
driven  and  often  justified simply   by  the  importance    of  using  new  technology   in  classroom.  Since  we   are
currently   living between    the  stages  of mobile   social  learning   and  ubiquitous   future,  the  role of mobile
technologies in different learning contexts is still a challenge for researchers and practitioners. Our claim is that
seamless learning can be one productive way for schools and other educational institutions to promote learning
skills, namely,   self-regulated  learning  and collaboration,    and to prepare    people for  the 21st century  learning
society. To advance research on self-regulated seamless learning, we propose few design guidelines for self-
regulated seamless learning.
          We   share    the constructivist   belief that   students   should  learn  in  environments     that deal   with
"fuzzy," ill-structured problems. Designing challenging collaborative learning tasks provides students with an
opportunity for multiple strategic activities and for self-regulation and shared regulation of learning. There
should not be one right way to reach a conclusion, and each solution should bring a new set of problems. These
complex problems and challenging learning tasks should be embedded in authentic tasks and activities, the
kinds of situations that students would face as they apply what they are learning to the real world (Needles &
Knapp,   1994).   Challenging    learning tasks require    scaffolds  and support.   For   example,  Belland   (2011)  has
suggested the following guidelines for the creation of appropriate scaffolds: (a) Support problem reformulation
through   qualitative   problem   modeling;   (b)   do not  give   specific  end goals;    (c) enable students   to make
comparisons between cases; and (d) enable students to work collaboratively.
          As suggested by Spiro et al. (1991), the same content can be elaborated multiple times. In practice, this
means that students encounter multiple representations of content using different analogues, examples, and
metaphors, for example, by using mobile tools or social software. The instructional design required then is for
students to revisit the same material, at different times, in rearranged contexts, for different purposes and from
different conceptual     perspectives. The    same  content   can  be   also elaborated  with   multiple   individual  and
collaborative phases before the collective activity allowing students opportunities for self-, co-, and shared
regulatory processes (Järvelä & Hadwin, 2013).
