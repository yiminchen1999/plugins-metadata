          Abstract: What does the social network structure of productive online communities look like?
          We present findings from a study that examined this question in the context of a popular Java
          programming      help forum.   Using    techniques informed    by  social network   analysis,  we
          leveraged GephiTM to visualize the social network of the online community and identified a
          core group of active help-givers central to the community. We then performed network motif
          analysis and found that a small selection of network motifs or patterns constitute the main
          building blocks of the entire network..

In this short paper we highlight two approaches for assessing learning interactions and participation in online
communities. First, we demonstrate the viability of social network analysis (SNA) as an analytical tool in our
study of an online community for programmers learning the Java language. SNA enabled us to identify the
existence of a core group of users who enjoy high level of reciprocal ties and are the top participants within this
open, voluntary community. Our investigation shows how SNA can be used to delineate different interaction
patterns  within a  help   forum   resulting in a deeper   understanding  of learning   and knowledge   construction.
Second, our study identifies productive structures and patterns of interactions that work within the context of a
help-forum. Specifically, the sheer number of interactions between the core group of help-givers and a relatively
large number of help-seekers necessitates the identification of the structural sub-communities that are formed
around individuals of this core-group of help-givers.

Background
With the advent of the internet, learners of the Java programming language can now take their learning beyond
the classroom    by drawing     on a variety  of  online learning  platforms  such  as  Usenet, MOOC     and   online
discussion forums. Amongst the mentioned technologies, online discussion forums have flourished and attracted
hundreds of thousands of learners who collaborate to increase their computer programming proficiencies and
contribute to constructing   knowledge    for   communal   benefit (see  Table 1  for   an overview  of participation
statistics of the four main Java online communities). The large numbers of online discussions that take place in
these forums indicate that they are potential sites of learning with significant reach.

Background
One useful methodology for examining interactions between learners in online communities is social network
analysis (SNA). This multi-level approach, scholars argue, can help provide a better understanding of individual
embeddedness     in structural  patterns (Frank,  1998;  Powell et al., 2005).   Social network analysis   has found
increased acceptance within education due to its ability to shed light on multiple levels of analysis and scholars
have called for more network research in education (Hallworth, 1953; McFarland & Klopfer, 2010). A multi-
level approach, for instance, helps to connect higher level of organizations ­ school districts ­ with micro level
classroom data. Over the past few years social network analysis has gained popularity in the CSCL community
(Jeong & Hmelo-Silver, 2010). In this context, social network analytics allows one to gain insights into the
practices  of a     social  group   and  can    illuminate interactions   within  structural  networks   of learners
(Haythornthwaite & de Laat, 2010; Suthers et al., 2012).This analytical method enables one to evaluate the
nature of  interactions    between  learners  to  understand  the  impact of  learning  activities so that  informed
instructional decisions can be made (Haythornthwaite, 2008). Overall, social network analysis is an innovative
area of research with unique application within the context of our research as it is particularly pertinent for
understanding learning analytics at multiple levels of analysis.

Method, Setting, and Analysis
We examined an open online help forum for Java programming language where an online text-based discussion
forum facilitates voluntary and open asynchronous discussion oriented towards newcomers' explication of their
learning needs. As there are limited studies conducted in out-of-school voluntary educational settings such as
online discussion   forums, it is   helpful to highlight  the distinctions in contrast with  the  formal classroom
environment. First, the structure of the online community is informally construed and help is mainly provided
by a  core  group of   volunteers.  Second,  participation and  collaboration   is voluntary and  not mandated   by
coursework. Third, the task structure in this study deviates from the common set-ups of common wrapper/starter
roles and open-ended class discussions without pre-designated roles. In this educational setting, a help-seeker
starts a discussion soliciting help from other community members who may emerge as voluntary help-givers to
assist them with their learning needs. The data collection procedure involved parsing downloaded web data
using  Perl scripts and  storing    them as  a relational database. The    discussion forum  comprised   of   37,472
discussion topics created between 2001 and 2010. The activities over these forums were captured and a User
information dataset contained details about all the registered users posting within the forum during the given
time frame in addition to the replying user ID. We used this data to develop the dataset required for social
network analysis  (for details see: Mitra, 2011). The GephiTM software (Bastian,    Heymann & Jacomy, 2008) and
Hu Yifan's Multilevel Layout force-directed algorithm (Hu, 2005) was leveraged for visualization purposes.

Community Structure
As demonstrated in Figure 1, the force algorithm has been applied to the entire network and the visualization in
Figure 2 indicates the presence of a small core group of help-givers with high degrees of interactions with other
community members. Given the positions of these core help-givers, it suggests that the community is highly
reliant on these individual for their expertise and voluntary efforts.

Table 2 describes the main network properties such as the total number of mean in/out degree and network
diameter. There are a total of 21,509 nodes and 125,944 edges for this network. The average path length for the
network is  3.253   where  the clustering   coefficient,  which indicates  how   embedded    the nodes are  in their
neighborhood,  is   at a relatively  low  value   of 0.335 and   indicate  that the  network  has  relatively sparse
connections. These figures suggest that the social groups in this community are not tightly connected to each
other which may be a consequence of deriving the social network from standalone discussion threads.

Network Motifs
One formal ­ empirical and conceptual ­ avenue for understanding relationships in a community is "Network
Morifs". Network motifs has been proposed by Milo et al. (2002) as recurrent patterns of local inter-connections
that occur in complex networks at frequencies that are significantly higher (reflected by the Z-score) than those
occurring in randomized networks with equivalent number of nodes, in degree and out degree. Motifs can be
small subgraphs of typically 3 to 7 nodes and represent the basic building blocks of most networks (Milo et al.,
2004; Mangan & Alon, 2003) to provide insights into the topology of complex networks (Juszczyszyn et al.,
2008; Kastan et al., 2004). Referring to the motif network analysis (see Table 3), we found that the "branch with
one mutual dyad" motif (M14)    and the branch motif   (M6)  make up approximately 63.5% of all recurrent
patterns in this community.

The network motif M14 represents an interaction triad that suggests that a learner is engaged in a bidirectional
interaction with one helper and a unidirectional interaction with another. Specifically, the latter two actors are
not interacting with each other in this triadic interaction and in contrast to the fully reciprocal motif (M174), the
motif is not complete. M6, as the second most frequently occurring motif, can be inferred as learning system
with one actor having two unidirectional interactions. This finding is not surprising considering that each help
discussion will usually involve helpers engaging in unidirectional interactions with the learner to assist the help-
seeker with the learning task at hand. The dominance of the two motifs M14 and M6 suggests that a large
number of interactions are not complete in this help-seeking online community. On the other hand, highly
connected motifs with more than 2 edges such as M36, M174, M238 and M46 occurred less frequently and this

finding  suggests  that interactions    between  help-givers and  help-seekers are   seldom reciprocal in  the help
discussions.

Conclusion
In this paper, we leveraged both social network analysis and motif analysis as a multilevel assessment approach
to examine   learning   interactions in  online  communities.   Through social network  analysis,  we  found  that a
relatively large number of help-seekers are supported by a small core group of helpers and suggest that it is
critical to consider the high help-seeker-to-helpers ratio in this setting. In addition, we found two network triad
motifs (M14 and M16) make up more than half of the network triads and that highly connected motifs were very
sparse. The  next  step to pursue    in this research is to examine the   quality of discussion in a sample   of the
discussion data and examine if the motifs play a role in determining the quality of discussion. We believe that
our approaches and findings can inform assessment practices in online learning conducted on MOOC and web-
based course management systems.
