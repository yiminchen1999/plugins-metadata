The aim of this research was to address the followingquestions:1. What is the nature of students' collaborationswith/around the computer?2. How can we study and assess effective computer-supported collaborative learning?3. How do students feel about using computers in alearning context?A review of existing literature showed that thereit is not clear that computer-supported collaborativelearningisnotnecessarilybeneficialrelativetoindividual learning (O'Malley and Scanlon, 1990, DelMarie Rysavy and Sales, 1990) and alsothatverylittle attention has been paid to the affective aspectsof computer-supported collaborative learning.Somefailure.

Time-based analyses
Developments over time may be an important factor
in the efficacy of collaborative interactions. This is an
aspect of  computer-supported     collaborative  learning
which has not     previously    been investigated.  There
may be an optimal way of working together and this
may develop over time - or conversely, students may
begin by   collaborating    effectively  but  after   some
period of collaboration,    this way    of working    may
break down and the collaboration become inefficient.
It is therefore important to look at the nature of the
interactions over time.
    Time-based analyses were used in both studies. In
the Secondary school study, an advanced         computer-
based tool was used to investigate a selection of the
interactions. This facilitated graphical representations
of the students interactions over time. Consequently,
patterns of talk and behaviour were discerned and these
were interpreted relative to the products and outcomes
of the collaborations.
    In the Primary school study, Timelines was not
used because it is not appropriate for analyses which
involve relatively large units of time. Instead, a hand-
made representation of the interaction was created and
this provided a description of the interaction as well
evidence   of    patterns within  the    interaction.  For
example, from the representation it is apparent that
the collaboration    broke   down    over  time  and   the
children stopped working with one another and split
the  task.    It  shows    that  the  majority    of   the
collaboration    occurred   while    the   children   were
recording the sound. It is also obvious exactly who
was working with who, and the teacher interventions
can be seen. It also shows the distribution of the four
different types of activities   associated with this type
of interaction.
    The time-based analyses clearly show the benefits
of this type of analysis. These representations provide
a way of describing the interactions and enable us to
see patterns in the interactions. This type of analysis
facilitates relating products, interactions and outcomes
to one another.

Conclusion
This paper has provided an overview of two empirical
studies on computer-supported collaborative learning.
These have been discussed from various perspectives.
In particular, they point to the necessity to take       a
wider view of assessing effective learning situations,
which  incorporates    affective as  well    as cognitive
factors and distinguishes between products, outcomes
and interactions. The studies illustrate the value      of
time-based analyses, particularly when investigating
collaborations    which   occur  over    more   than   one
session.
