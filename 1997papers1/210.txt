learners to elaborate their ideas.
         Thus,  externalization      of  knowledge      to
share with and to compare with others' might be a
key   to deeper   conceptual     understanding.        One
way to support this externalization process is an
instructional intervention.      Teachers can      support
students to report their ideas in their own words
then  search   friends    who     have   similar    ideas.
However, this instructional intervention may lead
students to generate a number of notes including
similar ideas so that they     can   not  search    useful
information in the database.
         Another possibility from the       system     side
might be   to  provide    a  function   for    students to
refer to  others'   ideas similar   to  their  own     then
revise the ideas in their own words.        This type of
function could be a solution to reduce notes that
include similar ideas so that learners         can  search
the database in a more useful way.
         Knowledge-based inquiries.       HCC learners
were generating more explanations on            problems
in contexts they had studied        before   CSILE.     A
possible   interpretation     for    the    result     that
explaining   activities   in  the   contexts    led   HCC
learners to deeper conceptual understanding may
be that the contexts consist of domain knowledge
which     requires    students    of    making         their
explanations   more      scientific.     However,      this
interpretation is not supported by another          result
that  HCC   learners   more   frequently    generated    a
primitive  level   of  explanations     (i.e., intention-
based).
         Another    interpretation   may    be   that   the
contexts   were    more     information-rich     because
students   had     conducted      experiments       before
CSILE    sessions.    Students'   explanations      in  the
contexts   could    be   referred   to  real   data    and
experiences shared by students.         Based    on    their
shared    experiences,    students     could    question,
criticize, and elaborate their own and others' ideas.
         Along   with    the  interpretation,    we    can
further consider instructional support for students
who   are likely   to  work   in  new   contexts.      One
possible   support    is  to  provide     students     with
opportunities    to   conduct     further   experiments

   Explanations
  Vibration-based      When heat comes in contact with a liquid, the molecules in the liquid start to move
                       faster and faster. The hotter it gets the faster the molecules move. So when you
                       see a liquid boiling, inside the liquid tiny microscopic particles are moving around
                       very fast.
   Density-based

Characteristics-based  I think that different solids are affected by heat in different ways. For example if
                       you had a thick metal bar and you applied it to heat it would begin to expand
                       because the heat excites the molecules and that makes the metal expand. But other
                       solids like wood are a drier substance so the heat would affect it more quickly and
                       it would start to burn.
  Intentions-based     My theory is that when heat is applied to some things they will expand. I think
                       that a solid such as metal will expand much faster than another object such as a
                       brick. I think that the particles in the metal will expand very fast. The bimetallic
                       strip bends because the particles get bent away from the flame. They       want to
                       move away from the heat.
 Heat-as-material-     Internal heat is the heat inside molecules and atoms. If a very hot rock, and a very
      based            cold rock made contact, the internal energy would pass through and change the
                       internal temperature of the rocks. After a while the internal temperature    will be
                       evened out, and the rocks will have about the same temperature.

                                 Would there be any difference in the boiling point of the two? Maybe
                                 we can try an experiment.

                              I need to understand if the boiling point would change if water was mixed
                                 with another liquid such as orange juice? If it would change what would
                                 it change to?
     Change in Shape          I need to understand why heat makes solids ( like the ball and     ring    )
                                 expand. If you left a solid too long in heat, what would be the effect?
                              Why do some soilds [sic] bend, shink [shrink] and expand?

Note. A total process of the movement in the problem space was divided into seven stages.                                     Each stage shows
cumulative frequencies of explanations students generated.                          Rows of the matrix show types of explanations:
V = Vibration-based, C = Characteristics-based, D = Density-based, I = Intention-based, and Ma = Heat-as-
material-based.       Columns show types of problem contexts:                        C = Heat conduction, M = Mode change, S =
Shape change, Cl = Color change, B = Burning, H = What heat is, and O = Others.                                       The area with bold lines
was considered as part of the problem space related to the classroom experiences before CSILE sessions.

Note.     A total process of the movement in the problem space was divided into seven stages.                                 Each stage shows
cumulative frequencies of explanations students generated.                         Rows of the matrix show types of explanations:
V = Vibration-based, C = Characteristics-based, D = Density-based, I = Intention-based, and Ma = Heat-as-
material-based.      Columns show types of problem contexts:                        C = Heat conduction, M = Mode change, S =
Shape change, Cl = Color change, B = Burning, H = What heat is, and O = Others.                                      The area with bold lines
was considered as part of the problem space related to the classroom experiences before CSILE sessions.
