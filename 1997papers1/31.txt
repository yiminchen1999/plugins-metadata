      The proposed poster session will report the results of a recent study exploring the

differences in teachers' and students' experiences with computers and perceptions of

computers and the effects of those differences within the social and cultural context of a

computer-supported classroom. Qualitative research techniques were used to conduct an

in-depth study of one class of fourth grade students, the classroom teacher and the

computer lab teacher in an urban, technology-rich school. The study resulted in the

identification of additional variables which affected this computer-supported setting and

led to the construction of a graphical representation of a conceptual framework showing

the relationships among these variables and the effects of students' and teachers'

perceptions of computers.
