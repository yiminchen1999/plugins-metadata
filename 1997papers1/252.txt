Plantations Pathfinder
The second pilot application, called Plantations
Pathfinder, is designed to supply information and
provide a collaboration space for visitors
(informal learners) as they move about the
gardens. At first, the program serves as an
electronic tour guide, or interactive docent,
enabling visitors to customize their visits and
access information about plant uses, history,
economics, and more (see Figures 3 and 4).
   The Plantations is a "living museum" and as
such is in constant change. An electronic guide
can be kept updated more readily than printed
materials. It can keep a record of the interests of
the visitor and collect information for them to
take home, such as by printing their "journal"
upon returning to the visitor center. As a
collaboration tool, the system enables users to
input information which can then be uploaded to
an electronic discussion forum. Much like the
comments books provided at museums and other
sites, visitors can view reactions and advice of                   Figure 3. Pounder Heritage Garden
