       Next we turn to the results from the students' actual
research    projects.       Students        carried  out      two    research
projects in this course, one about half way through the
curriculum and one at the end.               The projects were scored
by teachers using a 5-point scoring rubric.                   For the sake
of     brevity, we      have      added     the scores    for    these     two
projects together in Figure 3.              These results show again
that students in the Reflective Assessment                     Classes      do
better     on their     research      projects   than    students     in   the
Control Classes.           The results also show that cognitive
facilitation is particularly beneficial for the low-achieving
students:     low-achieving           students     in     the    Reflective
Assessment Classes perform almost as well as the high-
achieving students.        We also went on to evaluate whether
