      Technologies that fall under the rubric of computer-mediated communication consist
of a diverse array of electronic tools. Each of these tools has the power to amplify or reduce
different elements of human interaction (Bowers, 1988), thereby influencing the
collaborative process. Jonassen (1995) recommends using a variety of CMC media to
support multiple facets of meaningful knowledge construction.
      This poster presents an analysis of communication patterns of a class of 22
students, mainly seniors and graduate students, interacting within two CMC environments.
The first is an electronic bulletin board to which students could post comments about
readings or class discussions over the course of the semester. The second environment is a
synchronous chat session. Students in a lab received one of four handouts that designated
them as members of a particular electronic discussion group. Each group had to discuss a
certain issue and give a presentation, as a group, to the entire class later that day. The
members of each group used pseudonyms, so they were unaware of the identities of those
with whom they were interacting.
      Focus Question: How do interactions within a semi-structured, asynchronous CMC
environment differ from those that take place in a task-oriented, synchronous one, and how
does this shape the collaborative process?
      The data analysis charts the communication patterns which characterize the two
technologies, such as the rates of idea generation, interpersonal responsiveness and
conflict. The dynamism of the chat sessions encouraged questions, disagreements and
interdependence, emphasizing the social nature of knowledge construction. The lack of
temporal stresses and the long-term commitment associated with the bulletin board allowed
for reflective articulation of ideas and responses. This study is part of an ongoing research
project investigating effective methods for teaching about technology with technology.
