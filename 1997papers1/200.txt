Sorting the data by evidence categories makes this
task more manageable by enabling students to attend

particular piece of evidence encourages students to
reflect on the relationship of individual data to the
overall goal of the investigation.
   The domain-specific strategic support in the
Finch Scenario suggests inquiry actions that students
can take, and helps students identify issues that are
important to consider when reasoning about natural
selection. For example, the question-based interface
helps students identify differences in structure between
animals that survive and animals that die as an
important dimension to consider when reasoning
about this domain. Students interacting with the
Finch Scenario need to decide which comparison to
choose, what variable to observe, and how to
categorize their data. The domain-specific strategic
support makes it more likely that their discussions
when making these choices will center on the
important conceptual objects of the domain, because
these objects are the options that students can choose.         Figure 3. This screen shows the data log
