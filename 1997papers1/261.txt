Adding intellectual value toinformationThe availability of constructive, collaborativetools within the familiar WWW browserenvironment facilitates the shift in educationalactivities from simply retrieving and compilinginformation to adding some value to the retrievedinformation in the WWW. Students using Zebuare expected to create their own expressions oftheir own knowledge, by adding intellectual valueto the resources that may be provided to them fortheir project work. It is possible to embedto initial collections of information resources(Galleries and Reference Collections) aredescribed above (see Figures 1 and 2). The mostdirect facility for scaffolding is the ability tocreate templates for page creation. Zebutemplates are pages which automatically clonethemselves, so that students can start with a pagewhich already contains some content, as well assome structure (see Figure 8). For example, for astudent to learn about a particular process, ateacher might provide a page with a graphic orvideo "placeholder" object for a student to replacewith a graphic or video depicting the process, and

Coordinating student work
In working together on a project, a lot of effort
might be spent by participants in coordination
issues like where documents should be stored,
who should work on which pieces, how to ensure
consistency between contributions, etc. Zebu
provides some simple facilities for the
coordination of student project activities.

can create groups of students, and assign them to
