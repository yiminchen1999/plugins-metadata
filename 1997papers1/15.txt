                              Virtual Places:

   A Heterogeneous Network Architecture to Support Distant Learning and

                   Collaborative Science Simulations

   With funding from the National Science Foundation, we are conducting an

interdisciplinary program of social science and computer science research to develop a

network-based learning environment that facilitates highly interpersonal learning and

collaboration at a distance. We want to support student learning by situating it within a set

of social relationships, functional places, collaborative activities, and authentic discourse.

   In the design of our software, which we will demonstrate, we couple client-server,

multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) technology with peer-to-peer, synchronous

multimedia collaboration technology to support a range of asynchronous and synchronous

collaborative interactions that include the following capabilities, places, and resources:
 · Capabilities: Synchronous collaborative operation of simulations and other

   applications, the generation and simultaneous viewing of multiple representations, real-

   time spoken discourse, and shared gesturing.

 · Places: A range of persistent virtual places that support the use of these applications

   and related artifacts in a variety of ongoing social relationships. Places will include

   private, personalized places, such as virtual offices; semi-private personal places for the

   sustained work of two or three people, such as virtual project rooms and lab benches;

   open, public places for storing and using information (e.g., digital libraries); and public

   places for large group meetings or off-task social interactions (e.g., virtual lounges).

 · Resources: A variety of domain-specific collaborative multimedia simulations, digital

   resources, and specialized objects that take advantage of the above capabilities and

   usability of the architecture and that are customized for target learning communities.
