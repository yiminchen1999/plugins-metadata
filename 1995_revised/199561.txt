Once the domain oftechnical experts and "guru's, we are now told thatcomputers are "for the rest of us"[4].However,usablesoftwaredesignsstillmandatesome specialized training in their use [3].As computers become more prevalent in the workplace, individuals must both maintain their current level of productivity while learning new methods of performing taskstey had previously done either manually or using adifferent computer software application.Software thatminimizes learning time could be of substantial valueto deadline pressured workers who must take advantageof advancing technologies but do not have access tospecial training.DesiL (Designing for Learnability) is a methodology for informing the design of microcomputer software, that may permit a designer to produce both usableandmoreeasilylearnedsoftwareapplications.This methodology is non-deterministic in that it doesnot make decisions for a designer, but rather informs adesigner's options toward creating software that may bemore easily learned by the end user.[4].In the process of making a computer for the rest ofus,engineers,scientists,andpsychologistshavefocused much study toward making them more "usable"[2, 3, 5, 6].However, despite their "easy to use" status, the task of becoming a more efficient computeruser has remained a difficult and sometimes threateningtask [7].ThankstocurrentpracticeinHCI,beingacomputer user has become an easier task, but the process of becoming a computer user, or a more efficientcomputer user is still an awesome task.Althoughpublishersofcomputersoftwareareaware of the need to make their products easier to learnand use [2, 6, 8] current strategies of software designarenotalwayssuccessfulinproducingan"easytolearn" software application [9].Evidence of this isseen in the many different "helping" mechanisms computersoftwarepublishershaveinventedincludingprinted manuals, on-line "help" glossaries (softwareversions of printed manuals), hypertext help systems[6] and on-line demonstrations [10].Additional evidence is supplied by the successful third party and "selfhelp" publishing industry offering literally hundreds of
