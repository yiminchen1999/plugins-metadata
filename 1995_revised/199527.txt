by the student to certain case materials. When a studentrequests access to a case material, CALE locates the record7.A Session with CALE
in the materials table corresponding to the item selected.CALE then scans the request table to see if this materialhas been previously requested by the group or student andappends a new record to the request table noting the requestfor access.Then CALE checks the "question-material"table to see if the designer has entered any questions thatmust be posed to the student.The user is prompted withthe text of the question(s) and a text editor is displayed onthe screen in which the student types their answer. Finally,CALE checks for any other access constraints placed onTo provide an insight to the student interface, let us lookat a team tackling a case.It is the first session for a newcase. All of the nine students in this team are assembled,and huddle around CALE. As they log on in group modethey decide to first check the patients history.Figure 3shows the screen entities the student group sees after thisfirst menu selection.The patient history is shown in thewindow in the lower left hand corner, it consists of a videoclip of the patient and the following text: The patient understudy is a 4 1 /2 year old white male that has been refusing

These requestsare recorded, like in a chauffeured meeting sessions, andstudent names are put behind the requests, to identify responsibilities.Thus our group has developed a first taskplan. We now leave our group and come back a day laterwhen one of team members returns to work individuallyin user mode.Our student reviews the blackboard to see which information she needs to find to rule out certain hypothesis.She decides that the CT-scan should now be permissiblebecause in the last session the group has conducted a number of test that usually precede a CT-scan. This reasoningshows to be correct and the CT-scan is presented.Thestudent enters her observations into the margin note thatpops up with the image.She thus leaves information forher team members and works on her own assignment. Herentry is linked to the central blackboard.As she is scrutinizing the CT-scans once more, another student logs in at a branch campus. This student canonly come once a week to the central university. His tasksdepend on the normalcy of the CT-scan, as now cerebralproblems are ruled out for the moment.Via a talk facil-CALE has been evaluated with two classes of medical students (ca.160 students each) and their facilitators at theUniversity of Pittsburgh.CALE had been introduced tothe Medical DecisionMaking course.This course represents the transition from the basic science to the clinicalpart of the curriculum.For each group of ten studentsthere was one facilitator and one reserved PBLroom withan X-terminal that was connected to a central DEC Alpharunning CALE.
