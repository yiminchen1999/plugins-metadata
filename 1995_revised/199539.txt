There was a lingering fear that they would makea mistake and that it would not work or go well. Thestudent mentors took away much of the risk from theteacher by enthusiastically volunteering to set up thenetwork and or software program for the class activity.The students, demonstrated little fear of failure and persisted until they solved the problem and were able tomake the specific computer-based application fully op
