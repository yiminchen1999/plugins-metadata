1.    IntroductionCollaborative use of instructional systems can take ona variety of forms-from two or more students working on problems at the same computer workstation, using a tl.ltoring system that was primarily designed withan individual user in mind, to peer collaboration onsystems which were specially tailored for use by multiplelearnersworkingatthesameworkstationoracross networked machines.The latter are typicallycalledcomputer-supportedcollaborativelearning(CSCL) systems, since they are intended to "scaffold"or support students in working together productively.ness of collaborative learning as an instructional format(e.g., McManus & Aiken, 1993); to "create ideal learning experiences," as Brown and Palincsar invite instructional designers to achieve.In recent years, several researchers have attemptedto find out what makes some peer interactions successful but not others.One important line of research hasfocused on verbal exchanges during group work ·(e.g.,King, 1989; Webb I 987, 1989).This work convergeson an important finding: i.e., that the nature of peer interactions is perhaps the most critical factor mediatingindividual student achievement. As Webb and her col-
