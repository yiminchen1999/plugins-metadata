An analysis of the content indicated that there was more varietyin the types of responses after the LEAP experience.Also, terms associated with the reading writing workshop approach were found in the respondents' descriptions of goals.

The results of this qualitative study confirmed that the preservice teachers who field-testedLEAP did engage in rich dialogue triggered by thevideo-cases, the books, and their recollections of classroom experiences.Author'sAddressLizC.Stephens:SchoolofEducation,UniversityofHouston Clear Lake, 2700 Bay Area Blvd., Houston,TX 77058-1098. lstephens@jetson.uh,edu.
    Had they adopted a new perspective, however? The
majority of the students stated that they were not famil
iar with the approach before LEAP, and the education
courses at this field site did not include instruction on
the workshop approach. The authors of the sample es
says were overwhelmingly in favor of the workshop
approach after LEAP, and half stated their intent to use
the approach in their classrooms. A comparison of the
goals the preservice teachers expressed before their ex
perience with LEAP and after it supports the conclu
sion that many of them had adopted a new approach, at
least momentarily.
