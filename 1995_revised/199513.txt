Learning engineering meansdeveloping understanding in a wide variety of conceptualdomains(e.g.,physics,behaviorofmaterials,mathematics) while also developing expertise in problem understanding, problem-solving, and integratingdiverse conceptual domains [12).Adding to this already large load, engineering educators are now callingCaMILEwasfirstusedinthe1994-1995academicyear in a Mechanical Engineering course on design [5,16) and in a course sequence on Sustainable Development [17).
