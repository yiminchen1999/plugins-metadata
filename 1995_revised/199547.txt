Several recent reform movements in American education have called for changes in the goals of sciencelearning, leading toward new conceptions of scientificliteracy. For example, The American Association forthe Advancement of Science's Project 2061 [l], callsfor changes in the way we envision scientific literacy.The authors of "Science For All Americans" definescientific literacy in the following manner:"The scientifically literate person is one who isaware that science, mathematics, and technology areinterdependent human enterprises with strengths andlearners should be able to formulate hypotheses andquestions, predict, work with information to decompose a topic into sub-topics, gather data from a varietyof sources, organize diverse and contradictory information, and so on. Defining, building, and using modelsof scientific phenomena is one specific undertaking inwhich learners can begin to develop these cognitiveskills as well as build and use scientific knowledge.Furthermore, the sociocultural perspective of learninghas led us to a better understanding of activity andpractice, and how learning is accomplished throughsituated, cultural activity. This model of learning em
