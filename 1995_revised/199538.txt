In Phase 2, the teams identify the functional requirements of their systems. They think about who woulduse the proposed systems, what information the systems should provide, and how the information might beused. In this project phase, the teams are instructed tofocus on answering detailed questions about what theirproposed systems will do, rather than how they will do4.5.Phase5-PaperIn Phase 5, each team prepares a final report that includes everything from Phases 1 through 4 (in a refined,final form) and additional relevant material from its research.
