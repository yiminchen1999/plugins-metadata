Two    important theoretical changes   with  respect tolearning are at the root of the increasing interest inlearning environments that provide computer supportfor collaborative learning.The first is the view oflearning that considers both the social context and thesocial processes as an integral part of the learning activity(Brown,Collins,&Duguid,1989,Greeno&Moore, 1993, Lave & Wenger, 1991, Resnick, 1991,Rogoff & Lave, 1984).The second is the recognitiondiffer in that for Piaget, social interaction is seen fromthe perspective of its role in the development of logicalreasoning. While, for Vygotsky, social interaction is atthe core of the developmental process and children'slearning.In his theory, individual cognitive development is a process related to transforming socially regulated and mediated knowledge.See Confrey, (1994,1995) and Tudge and Rogoff (1989) for a more detailed analysis of these two theories.
