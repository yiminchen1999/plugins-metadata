    [3:38]
   Mo:     Do you want to put anything in, how ... we could always put something ... like, land animals, it says they could, like, travel on
           rafts of vegetation or on logs.... Do you want to put that in, because that's a way that they could've both migrated to the is
           lands.
   Ernin:  OK.
    [3:57]
   Ernin:  If there were no marine iguanas anywhere in the world except for the Galapagos, wouldn't that mean that they had developed
           from the land iguanas, and not from any other ... the land-?
   Mo:     Um, well, they could've, but I think what, uhh-
   Emin:       Or they would've found, they might've found a climate, like, any other climate-
   Mo:     It says these two species separated about 12 million years ago, but maybe, like, and the islands weren't around then, so proba
           bly what happened is the rnaiine iguanas died out by then everywhere else. Like, not by then, but by the time they got to the
           Galapagos islands they died off everywhere else, maybe. Does that make sense?
   Emin:   Yeah. So, do you want to put this in there, and then ... type what you just said? That they probably died out by then.
   [4:01]
   Mo:     OK, now let me see what this says ... [read text ofdocument indicating that marine iguanas do not swimfor long distances.]
           ... But that wasn't a very long distance so that doesn't count. Because Ecuador to-
   Emin:       So the land iguanas probably developed from the marine iguanas, because
   Mo:     Well, yeah, but they also, see, that's why we put that, they can go on the rafts and
   Emin:   How did they get there in the first place? On the vegetation or whatever?
   Mo:     Yeah, the rafts or on logs.
   Emin:   Hey, look; the marine iguanas don't breathe under water.
   Mo:     They don't breathe under water?
   Emin:   They hold their breath.
   Mo:     Well, that's OK. That doesn't matter.
   Emin:   Well, it shows that they probably evolved from the land.
   Mo:     No, because they can always, urn, come up if they're swimming under water ... [examining map of location of the Galapagos
           relative to South America] 600 miles; well ... that's still not too far ... It looks close on the map.
    4:28]
   Emin    [upon opening document that states that no marine iguana fossils have been found anywhere in the world other than the
           Galapagos]: Uh-oh. [Emin points out contents to Mo; Mo groans]
    [4:52]
   Emin:   Look; the second one [points in R-pane], it kind of goes with these two top ones [points to #4 and 5], that they developed
           from ordinary land ones, because no fossils had been found, and no marine ones are anywhere else.
   Mo:     Urnrn ... That could be connected to either this one, right here [mouses over#c], or it could be connected to these two [mouses
           over #4 and 5], I think. I think either way you could connect it. Because you could say that because they separated here
           [mousing over #c], they could've, urnm, the marine could have died out, the marine iguanas, and then they could have, like,
           been reborn almost.
   Emin:   Why would they die out?
   Mo:     I don't know. [laughs] Somehow they could have died...
   Emin:   Died out on the islands? Because there were no fossils found anywhere else in the world.
   Mo:     Yeah ... Well, they could've died out when those islands weren't around then. So they probably - They could've just died out
           wherever they were, and then, urnrn, the land iguanas, when they got to the islands, they, then in 2-3 million years, the marine
           iguanas developed from them.
   Emin:   But, you're saying that they died- that they were living someplace else and they died, and the land iguanas went to the Galapa
           gos islands, and new marine iguanas were born again?
   Mo:     Because there's no proof that says that the original marine iguanas are the same as the ones that are right now. But I don't
           know-
   Emin:   Yeah, I see what you mean.
   Emin:   [A few minutes later] OK, but if they migrated separately, how did the marine ones get there in the first place, if no fossils
           have been found elsewhere? They had to start out from someplace.
   Mo:     Oh. Well maybe they just haven't found any yet. [Emin laughs] The fossils are always beneath the water; maybe they just did
           n't, I'm sure it's hard to find fossils underneath the water.
   Emin:   They rnight've died on land. [laughs]
    [5:07]
   Emin:   Well, I think the answer is that just the land iguanas came from South America, by floating vegetation or whatever, and a sub
           species developed off them which were the marine iguanas, since their fossils weren't found anywhere else.
   Mo:     I sort of agree with these two [points at bottom two ovals in R-pane], that the two kinds of iguanas separated on islands that
           are now worn down that are closer to South America, and then they both could have migrated to the Galapagos Islands, be
           cause marine animals- marine iguanas aren't found anywhere else, that would, like, explain that.
   Emin:   I'd like information on whether or not those islands, the worn-down islands ... if there were fossils and stuff
   Mo:     yeah, more on if, uhh-
   Emin:   ... other possibilities.
   Mo:     Where they've searched for fossils, too.
