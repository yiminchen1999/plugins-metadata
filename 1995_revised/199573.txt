may read and add, and an author may read, add, and
also delete annotations.  In addition, annotations added

groups.   For example you might have the role of an
author in one group and be a reader in another.     Groups
can also define a "default" role, providing some level
of access to unregistered users.   If there is no default
role, then unregistered    users  are not permitted      any
access to the documents or annotations in the group.

the document, they are stored in a separate database,and are interpolated into the document when it isdelivered to the user.Thus the document itself is not12*234Figure 2.Annotations read per day by problem set due date.Note the double dip for problem set two, which was postponed.
