is a collaborative environment where students use each
other as a resource for information and the teacher acts
as a facilitator who guides students to a deeper under

Another method of supporting inquiry during anchored
instruction  focuses on small group interaction.     The
computer    provides   a  level  of scaffolding  beyond
structuring the classroom discourse through keyword
structures.    Instead of students  sharing information
across a network of computers, the students work in

The problem is posed using a video called the "Golden
Statuette" [4] that depicts a modern day version of the                                                             GNl:  Whet shOu\d the proprietor pey for the stetuette?

properties of the statuette [2]. In this environment stu
dents can experiment to construct the knowledge they
need to solve the problem.
      Identifying a problem is the first part of solving a
problem [l].    The    primary  source for exploring  the
problem is through the anchoring medium; therefore,
as shown in Figure 2, the students have direct access to

The tool below the scrollingb:31: allows the students to create a "marker" for a specific range of the movie.With this tool they can labeland save important data in the movie and quickly retrieve it through the list of markers in their notebook.This notebook, on the right in Figure 2, functions as acentral collection resource for all the information thestudents generate and find during the inquiry process.The first goal is to describe in the notebook what ishappening and what potential problems exist.Once the problem has been defined and possiblegoals for solving it discussed, the students work with aset of tools to begin exploring properties of the statuette.Figure 3 illustrates the array of tools organized toprovide students with a way to simultaneously view allthe components of the problem solving process.Theglobalproblem,orgoal,isposedatthetopofthescreen.The virtual laboratory area beneath the problem provides the tools used to obtain physical proper-Other tools allow students to weigh and measurethe dimensions of the statuette.Students can easilyaccess a database of information including geometricrelationships, physical properties of materials, price ofmaterialsandotherscientificinformationusingthereference tool.Students may browse through this information and copy any of its contents into their notebooks.A simple "click and drag" operation allows thestudents to move facts from the reference materials ormeasurement tools to the notebook.The electronicnotebook provides a key feature to allow students torecord what they feel is important, because they oftenforget to take notes.This feature helps students visualizetheinformationtheyhavemutuallychosenasimportant.It also provides the teacher with a quickvisual reference for where students are in the problemsolving process.Therefore, the teacher can quicklyassess and react to each group's individual needs.
