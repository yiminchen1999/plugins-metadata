language provides us with an interpretative lens to understand both what gets accomplished in small laboratory groups as well as how it is accomplished. Learning science includes constructing understandings thatare consistent with empirical evidence and the theoretical backdrop of a discipline. MBL experiments allowstudents the possibility of interacting with the physicalworld and simultaneously reacting to representations ofthese events. This provides a unique setting for studying students' conversations.2.1.SocioculturalviewSociology of science documents the problematic natureof scientific inquiry. The social processes of constructing scientific knowledge are central to establishing aclaim(Collins&Pinch,1993;Kelly,Carlsen,&Cunningham, 1993).

of action units, we reviewed again the videotape andnoted each instance that a computer representation wasproduced or that a student specifically employed a computer representation in the conversation. Each of theseinstances was coded based on how the reference fit intothe larger conversation. Figure 2 shows how the analysis of student discourse allows for the identification ofinteractional patterns on a representative piece of transcript.In each case the computer representation entersthe conversation in one of the two ways described below.There are two pathways in which the computerrepresentations enter into the group conversations.
