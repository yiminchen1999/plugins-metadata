LearningOur view is that mathematics is crucial to everydayliving and to current scientific practice.Hence, ourmaterials are designed to reflect that view through agroup-based applications approach to learning mathematics. Central to our applications project focus is theplacing of students in design problems that require theuse of mathematics concepts as tools for their solutions. By experiencing the utility of applying theseconcepts as tools, students have a chance to appreciatethe power of the mathematics. The students can compareanddeepentheirevolvingunderstandingandmastery of the tools-in-use.Ourchargeistodesignmathematicslearningenvironmentsthatintegratereal-worldproblemsolving,collaborativegroupwork,andmaterialresources that include computer-based tools.

The computer applications support designing solutions to these problems byproviding multiple representations, levels of operation,and analytic opportunities.Currently, there are three MMAP software environments.Ineachtechnologysupportedproject,groups of students role-play adult occupations: architectural designers (using ArchiTech©), cryptographersand cryptanalysts (using Coding Toolbox©), or biologists and policy designers (using HabiTech©). Eachindividual plays a role in a group, and each group inclass-wide activities. The goal is to create situationswhere the math can be helpful in solving a commonproblem, and student conversations and discussionshelp to bring about new mathematical understandings.The computer simulation tools allow students to immediately design solutions to their problem withoutgetting bogged down in unnecessary technical details,computation, or symbolic forms. The environmentsgive students access to multiple representations of theirwork and information about the different designs theycreate. The technology also helps students organize
