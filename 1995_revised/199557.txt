     Given the incremental development of Ariadne,the results of the sequence of testing are necessarilyboth preliminary and anecdotal. Nevertheless we believe that the results obtained are of importance in informing subsequent development of the system and incontributing to our understanding of the nature of thebehaviour we wish to support [27].5.3.Observations on Ariadne UsageThe history representation became a focus for discussion. This has been noted for other CSCW and CSCLsystems [27]. For those groups who chose to return forsubsequent sessions, the ability to rapidly review thesearch they performed a week or more ago proved tobe a useful orientation activity, particularly where thegroup members had not convened in other circum

They had to agree a general theme inCognitive Psychology and then each student had topick a more precise topic to study in detail from theprimary literature. They were each to produce an individual report which would be collected together and,withaninitiallinkingchapter,wouldformtheircourseworkdocument.ThestudentsusedAriadnet(olardgeecli_ydewoitnh BIDS) at the beginning of their collective theme and the on task, their both individual subtopics. This activity revealed one of the keytcih_ maera. cTtehreistpircoscoefssbroofwasninagly; shionwg the goals retrieved evolve over hits from asearch led the groups to redefine what it was that theywished to investigate. Some groups chose to return tocontinue working in later sessions, as individuals, subgroups and full groups. Most students were unfamiliarwith bibliographic databases but confident in using thebasic options of Lancaster's OPAC.An initial concern was that the concept of visualising a search process might require a certain degree ofunderstanding of the nature of bibliographic databaseuse. For competent users it is fairly clear that a recordof their actions would allow them to reflect on whatthey have done, share and discuss it with colleaguesand consider alternatives and improvements. What wasless clear was whether the system would be of use torelative novices.stances since the last session.Users were keen to get printouts of informationthey had found. Consequently an option to print thecontents of a card was added. Numerous other minorchanges to the interface were made in the light of theitrative_ testi?g llil:d development. Although seeminglymmor,mterfaceissuessuchasthepositioningandwording of menu options can have a enormous effecton usability for novices. A consequence of this is thatthe folding and annotation facilities have received lesstesting as they have evolved rapidly.

These canbe caused by substantial misconceptions about the natur of bibliographic databases [29], but also by simpletypmg errors. The latter are of concern because of occasionswhenagroupattemptedaperfectlysoundstategy, but due to a minor error (a typing or syntacticmistake), the action failed to yield anything and so thestrategy was abandoned. The users may not be awareof the error and, we observed in some cases, refused tobelieve that they had made it until confronted with the

other search, and in the cases we note here, never go
back to examine the results. This can be due to the
presence of multiple search goals, so that completing
one leads to attempting the next before the results of
the first are examined. Another observed cause was
that undertaking one search inspired an idea for an
other tactic, and the users got carried away with trying
out this technique before examining the results of their
earlier trial. This behaviour has been noted both for
individuals and for groups. We believe the situation

6.  Future WorkSo far, all the testing of Ariadne has been synchronousand co-located. We have also undertaken small scalestudies of other modes of cooperative working [24]which indicated problems with the usefulness of synchronous remote collaboration. Therefore, we are developing Ariadne to support asynchronous, remote collaboration. One aspect of this will be the sending ofannotated searches using electronic mail. In order toinvestigate another approach, we have already implemented an option to convert the record of a search intopossible degree of collaboration we need to allow for arange of technologies and platforms. Although closelycooperating group members may all be using the sametechnology, they may wish to draw on the assistance ofan outsider who does not have the same systems available. Hence the group may use Ariadne to cooperatebetween themselves, but have to resort to the WWWhistories or conventional email for working with others. Collaborative systems should be designed to support a graceful degradation of functionality to permit awider degree of participation.
