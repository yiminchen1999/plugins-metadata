form their own community: community of new staffmembers, and help each other. Thus they overcomedifficulties which occur in their practices. The newstaff members are monitoring each other, paying attention to who has already experienced what, or who isgoing to experience what. Consequently, they ask othernew staff members who have previously experiencedsome new procedures for help with these procedures.Those who have learned a new thing eagerly give theinformation to the other new staff members. They trytosharetheirknowledgemutuallywiththeothersthrough making and circulating memos in which theyrecord procedure of treatments and important numbers,e.g., time of a treatment, quantity of dose. They ealso circulating an informal diary in which they wnteabout their daily experience, including both vocationaland private concerns, and they respond to the others'descriptions. This diary is one way to make their experiences shared.Community of new nurses, which is a sub-community within the nursing community, isa "community of learners" through which its members are becoming regular staff members in the nursing community. When facing senior nurses, the new nurses feeloverwhelmingly"incompetent".Insuchacircumstance, it is not easy for new nurses to establish theirown identities and sense of competence. On the otherhand, in their own community of new staff nurses, thenew nurses can position each other as "a little more3.1.An educational tool which supportscommunity of learnersIf learning is the process of establishing a certain position in a community of practice, computer based educational tools have to be designed so that they supportthe learners' participation in a culture of practice.

Kendon(l 990)  presented the idea  that    there isspace called transactional space around one's body.According to his idea, trying to fix one's body toward acertain object is equal to trying to set one's own transactional space upon the object. When people's transactional spaces are overlapped shared collaborative spaceis generated. Furthermore, Kendon introduced concept4.1.The concept of AlgoBlockHere, the authors introduce an educational tool: AlgoBlock (Suzuki et al. 1994a), which facilitates the interaction among learners. AlgoBlock (Fig. 1) is a programlanguage which has an actual physical existence. Eachtangible block is assigned a command of logo-like program language, and the program can be made by con

In such a way, eye lines and body movement and its
positioning are important resources for social interac
tion
     The other principle is to design the tool as an
"open tool" (Hutchins 1990) which openly displays the
process of collaborative work to the members. It allows
members of collaborative work to monitor each other
regarding what the other members are thinking and the
present condition of the work. Thus, the conversation
and discussion among members in the community are
induced and overall performance in the community of
learners as a functional system is heightened.
     Here is an example of an open tool. In the previ
ously mentioned investigation on learning of nurses,
the authors found that nurses are utilizing a tool called
"order bar" (Shiji-bou, in Japanese). It is    a plastic
marker which can be slipped between pages of the
clinical records. It is placed there when the physician
gives some order to the nurse. The length is arranged
so it can be seen from outside even when the records
are closed. By simply looking at the clinical records,
the staff nurses can know if there are any orders by
physicians or not. Upon completing the treatment or
dered, the staff nurse who provided the treatment can
take the bar out of the clinical records. The order barfunctions as an open tool showing whether or not anyFigure 1.AlgoBlock: It is an open programming language.
orders are given by physicians to the whole staff and
enabling the whole staff to monitor the status of taskexecution. The order bar functions as an open tool, butit is not only because of the physical reason that itslength comes out of the clinical records. In the observation, the authors saw a scene in which one new staffnurse was blamed by a senior nurse for taking away aclinical record which had the order bar in it from a certain desk. The openness of the order bar is maintainedThe result of running the program is indicated on aCRT screen in the form of an animated submarine (Fig.2). The age of expected use will be from higher yearelementary school students to junior high school students. This tool was designed to allow learners to improve skills of problem solving through collaborativeprogramming work.
