running a distant learning post graduate professionaldevelopment masters degree CSCL programme, usingcomputer conferencing systems such as Caucus and LotusNotes. The students are part-time, and are employedas trainers and developers in organisations throughoutthe UK. The programme is based on a philosophywhich acknowledges that people learn in different ways,and has an action learning and research focus which allows participants to make choices about the manage-2.AMethodologyforCSCLWhat constitutes a useful learning design for establishing and maintaining a virtual CSCL community ?

3. Openness         In The   Educational       Process-TheLearningCommunityOpenness in the educational process is an overarchingdesignfeaturewhichpermeates CSCLgenerally.Openness does not only relate to aspects of the administration of any learning event or course, where barriersto openness such as when and at what pace a personcan study are relevant. Openness relates to freedomaround the relationship of the learners to such things ascoursecontentandmethod,choiceandnegotiationwithin the course, self and peer assessment, and tutorlearner relationships. It is also to do with the learners'willingness to share ideas and be open with their intellects; to be open to new ideas and to the possibility ofchange.Learners should be in a position to make decisionsabout their learning, and feel they have a large degree offreedom in doing so. They also need the power to exercise their choices.There has to be a mechanism for achieving openness and freedom, and for the exercise of the learners'power. One which works particularly well in CSCL isthe concept of the learning community, which is madeup of both staff and learners who have equal rights toIn CSCL, one aspect of self management is learning how to learn. Learning to learn is embedded inCSCL processes. It is not of the study skills varietywhere an expert tells learners how to learn. By playinga major role in determining their own learning and byworking cooperatively with other learners and tutors,learners will have to face issues of learning how tolearn within the processes of the cooperative learninggroup itself.In being self-managing, learners are more likely toadopt deep approaches to learning. The responsibilityof managing your own learning within the learningcommunity quickly makes it clear to you that how youlearn and why are largely up to you. Other learners andtutors in the community work with you around yourconcernsandinterests,butyouhavetomakethechoices about how and why you are learning. This requires, and leads to, deep approaches to learning whereyou engage with the material, situation, issue etc in ameaningful way, and attempt to bring your own understandings to bear on it in doing so. If the communityis working as a learning community (sharing, supporting, challenging, critiquing, questioning etc.), learnerswill constantly be faced with working at deep levels.

This makes it quite different from traditional, staff-led courses and also from independent studies courses and flexible learning courses (Snell 1989).The role of the tutor in all of this is crucial. The5.ARealPurposeInTheCooperativeProcessCooperative learning requires a real purpose in the cooperative process. This is often best achieved through aproblem centred, or issue centred, approach to learning.This can take many forms. For example, each learner
