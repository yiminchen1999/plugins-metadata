Artemis is an interface to the University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL), developed to help support K-12
students doing inquiry in complex information environments such as the WWW.                 The Artemis interface, which is
programmed in Java,     is designed to overcome some of the limitations of conventional WWW browsers and
search engines.    K-12 students often find WWW searching to be disorienting and unproductive, and typically
have trouble formulating keyword searches in unfamiliar content areas, sorting through long lists of search
results, and organizing and storing results of their searches.     Artemis has features such as support for keyword
'browsing', storage for past results, and other organziational aids (see figure below) to help support student
inquiry.

Artemis was developed for the University of Michigan Digital Library, and provides access to the proprietary
collections of that project, as well as the WWW.        The UMDL is an NSF-sponsored project that uses current
technology, including agent-based architecture and learner-centered interface design, to support learning with
digital media. The Artemis interface has been through two rounds of beta testing at the middle school level, and
is being deployed in high school classes during the 1997-98 school year.
