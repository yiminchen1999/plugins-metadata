To foster collaborative learning, middle school students must develop
collaboration skills, such as how to look at ideas from different eople's
perspectives and how to negotiate a shared perspective. The WebGuide
software is designed to support perspectival viewing and negotiation in a
natural way, but also to raise related issues to conscious reflection.

WebGuide supports teams of students conducting research on the web; it lets
them share bookmarks, queries, notes and summaries that arise in the
research.

The shared information space is viewed through various perspectives so that
all students can construct their own personal view of the materials,
rearranging them under different categories and enerating new summaries or
annotations. All information can be modified within a personal perspective.

Students can view the work of other students, copy items to their personal
workspace, and propose that items they have created be incorporated in the
team's shared perspective. For a proposed item to be accepted in the team
perspective, team members must deliberate and agree to accept it.
