This paper attempts to discriminate among online learning environments in
terms of their capacities to foster varying levels of discourse within
communities. The author speculates about the practical and empirical
implications of stimulating and sustaining varying levels of discourse within
online learning communities.    Several key constructs that form the
foundation for a discussion of the differential use of Web-based technologies
to foster the creation and maintenance of online learning communities
emanate from the work of John Dewey -- specifically, The Public and Its
Problems, in which concepts such as: the associative being, public and private
communications, and community are defined.

Computer-supported collaboration via the World-wide Web provides an
excellent metaphor and venue for conjoint action toward mutually beneficial
goals, satiating the need of humans to join in associations, and providing a
mode for individuals to learn via the participatory activities that occur as a
result of various partnerships. Designers, instructors and students must
examine the scope and intentions of the communications they wish to foster
when choosing which communication method to utilize.      The attributes of
each level of discourse play a considerable role in what implications and
consequences arise from the communications of those engaged within the
environment. Those who recognize these attributes and utilize them to
enhance the collaborative effort are more likely to ensure that the web-based
endeavor is a successful one.
