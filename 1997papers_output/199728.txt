The Virtual-University is a Web-based groupware designed to support collaborative
learning. Several university courses were taught entirely online using the software.
Transcript data, usage statistics, and interview with selected participants were used to
collect information on patterns of online interaction and to investigate collaborative tasks in
asynchronous mode.

Communication patterns among students and with the instructor are investigated in regard
to frequency and type: how often student communicated, how often they accessed the
online classroom and their group tasks, what type of messages they used to communicate:
text only, text + hyperlinks, text + multimedia, text + hyperlinks + multimedia.

Transcript analysis supported by usage statistics provides a framework for understanding
the functioning of the online classroom. Findings are triangulated with interviews with
instructors and selected students.

This poster discusses the emerging patterns of interaction in online classrooms and
identifies collaborative learning models used in three university courses in Business, Arts,
and Applied Sciences.
