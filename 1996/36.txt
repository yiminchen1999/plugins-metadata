             Abstract:      We  investigated the influence  of  spatial visualization, spatial reasoning, and
             environmental   cognition  skills on   students'  use of   instructional  hypermedia  navigation
             tools.  Forty undergraduate cognitive science students were randomly assigned to one of two
             hypermedia system conditions:       a map-like navigation   tool  ("spatial" representation) or a
             menu-like navigation tool ("less spatial").  All students performed a searching activity, then
             browsed freely through the system.      Students then commented on their perceptions of the
             system   and   drew concept  maps   of the contents.   Regression   analyses   indicate that per
             formance   with   the map-like  navigation   tool is  positively correlated  with environmental
             cognition, whereas performance with the menu-like navigation tool is positively correlated
             with   spatial visualization  and   reasoning.    The  general   findings    suggest that  spatial
             navigation   tools  should be   incorporated into  instructional  hypermedia   with   less spatial
             navigation methods to complement students' spatial cognitive abilities.

Introduction

 The past two decades have seen a remarkable increase in the use of computers in education.          Hypermedia is in
 the early stages of development, and the focus of educators on the instructional potential of hypermedia systems
 has generated a host of questions regarding the organization of, and access to, information in these systems.
 This paper presents results from an investigation into the relationship between spatial abilities and the use of
 instructional hypermedia systems.      If, as is commonly assumed, information in a hypermedia system is
 represented spatially, then successful navigation through, and integration of, the information will likely be
 related to a student's ability to mentally represent and manipulate an "information space."         The results of this
 study provide evidence for the influence of hypermedia navigation on conceptual structure and, it is hoped, will
 guide future implementation of navigation tools in instructional hypermedia systems.

 Spatial Ability    and   Navigation     in  Instructional     Hypermedia

 Authoring systems such as Hypercard have resulted in powerful, flexible tools and have made possible the
 design of instructional  materials  using   multiple   links  within   and between    documents     and  media.  This
 flexibility of structure allows students to explore material in a nonlinear, interactive, fashion and can make
 these applications effective tools in an educational environment [McAleese 1989].          Instructional hypermedia
 applications are still so new that their effectiveness as teaching tools is not well documented.             Jonassen
 outlines three problems commonly associated with hypermedia [Jonassen 1989]:             (1) students may get lost in
 the network of information due to unsuitable links or navigation methods, (2) students may not be able to
 construct a conceptual overview or access all parts of the information, (3) students may have difficulty finding
 information or making the correct path choices.

 Information structures and tools have been developed to aid students in both orientation ("Where am I?") and
 navigation ("How do I get to...?") while following a path through an instructional hypermedia application.          A
 recent line of research investigates the "navigation problem" of whether students are able to take advantage of
 the learning potential offered by the flexibility of hypermedia systems or become "lost in hyperspace."             A
 solution to the navigation problem that appears to be gaining in favor is to provide several general navigation
 tools, including: backtracking or history mechanisms, overview diagrams or maps showing various levels of
detail, landmarks or prominent nodes, indexes, and on-line guidance [Nielsen 1990].

36
A student's ability to talce advantage of such hypermedia structures and tools is likely to be related to their
ability to represent the hypermedia environment spatially (cf., [McGrath 1992]).    We might expect that search
and navigation skills required in hypermedia systems will exhibit a high correlation with environmental
cognition (e.g., sense of direction, path-finding), perhaps even more so than with traditional psychometric
measures of spatial ability [Pearson & Ialongo 1986].     It has been suggested that students interacting in a
hypermedia environment attempt to create cognitive representations, or "maps," of hypertext structures similar
to those reported in the literature on environmental navigation [Edwards & Hardman 1990] .   Given the analogy
between navigating in a physical environment and in a hypermedia environment, it seems plausible that a
spatial cognitive representation of a hypertext would manifest itself.

Conceptual      vs.  Spatial   Navigation

This study will help to determine which information structures and navigation tools can be effectively used by
students.   It has been suggested that providing overly explicit spatial representations of a hypermedia
environment-e.g., in the form of overview maps-could interfere with a student's attempts to construct their
own mental map of the information [Stanton, Taylor & Tweedie 1992].             If navigation in a hypermedia
environment is primarily conceptual, the apparent structure of a spatial map may be misleading.   However, if
navigation   is primarily    spatial-that  is, following  routes and      landmarks analogous  to  naturalistic
environmental navigation-a map-like navigation tool may reduce the cognitive overload required to form a
mental representation of the system's structure.

If the representation of a hypermedia environment is spatial, students varying in their ability to represent their
environment spatially should differ in their performance and in how well they are able to use various navigation
tools in a hypermedia environment.   In this study, the following hypotheses are addressed using a hypermedia
environment incorporating either a map-like or menu-like navigation tool:     (1) students with differing spatial
skills will  differ in their representations   of and organizations    of connections among  nodes within the
hypermedia environment, and (2) students with differing spatial skills will differ in their use of navigation tools
and navigation strategy.

Method

Subjects

Forty undergraduates (27 men and 13 women) from the University of California, Berkeley, participated in this
experiment as part of a laboratory assignment in an introductory Cognitive Science course.        The students
ranged from 17 to 33 years of age.    All students had some experience with computers, though they varied in
their experience with hypermedia applications.

Design   and  General    Procedure

The participants were randomly assigned to one of two hypermedia conditions:     map or menu.  The content and
structure of the information in the two systems was identical, but the means of navigating through the two
systems varied.  Subjects spent about four hours on the activities, as described below.

Materials    and    Specific Procedures

Hypermedia      Activities   and  Stack   Design

Students worked with the "CogSci" review hypermedia stack for 40 minutes during a laboratory section.     For
the first 25 minutes, they   engaged in a search task, answering a series of   Cognitive Science questions that
required the integration of the material in the stack. For the last 15 minutes, they were permitted to browse
freely through the information in the stack.   After their interaction with the review stack, students were given
as much time as they needed to complete a questionnaire reflecting on their activities.

                                                                                                            37
 The hypermedia environment was created using Hypercard 2.2 with color tools (the program will be referred to
 as a "stack").     The hypermedia environment is designed to help students identify themes running through the
 Cognitive Science course by linking together diverse topics, methods, and theoretical background.                                                                                                                              Two
 separate stacks were designed for this study:                                      one using diagrammatic "maps" for moving from one screen of
 information (or "card") to another, and one using "menus" for such movement.

 The       menu stack has                three  principal     menus,                each             with different                                                 emphases,            to   serve         as  "landmark" nodes:
 Topics, Investigations, and History.                        The individual cards (thirty-three cards of information) in the menu stack
 are identical to those in the map stack except for the navigation tools in the upper left corner of the screen [see
 Fig. 1].     Students use local "pop-up" menus either to return to a principal menu or to select a related card to
 move to.

 The map stack has a global system map that serves as the "landmark" node.                                                                                                                From the global map, students
 can move to any card in the system (including local maps).                                                                                                 The local maps graphically show the links to all
 the cards related to a particular card (i.e., those that appear in the pop-up menus in the menu stack) and students
 use the local maps to move to a new card [see Fig. l].

 Environmental                      Cognition             Tasks

 Students were led in small groups through the third floor of a campus building, and their attention was directed
 to fourteen sites along the path. They were then given sufficient time to complete a questionnaire highlighting
 knowledge about the distance and direction of places in relation to each other (indicating configural knowledge;
 cf., [Kozlowski & Bryant 1977]).                          Students were also asked to draw their path on a two-dimensional map of the
 environment (indicating route knowledge), and to identify the locations of the fourteen sites on their path
 (indicating landmark location knowledge; cf., [Pearson & Ialongo 1986]).

 Psychometric         Spatial                  Cognition         Tasks

 Measures of spatial cognition generally measure two primary facets of spatial cognition:                                                                                                                         spatial reasoning
 (about relations) and spatial visualization.                                      The Space Thinking (Flags) two-dimensional mental rotation test
 served     to test spatial              reasoning        [Thurstone                &  Jeffrey            1959].                                                   Spatial visualization was tested with a two
 dimensional Minnesota Paper Form Board Test [Likert & Quasha 1970] and a three-dimensional surface
 development problem set from the Differential Aptitude Test [Bennett, Seashore & Wesman 1974].

Results

For purposes of visualizing the results, students were divided into high- and low-spatial groups based upon a
median score that spanned the three spatial ability measures.                                   The total psychometric spatial  score (three tests
combined;  max     possible =                            292, median       = 150) and    the total environmental  cognition     score  (two tests
combined; max possible = 32, median = 20) were proportionally combined to produce a general spatial
cognition score (max possible = 548, median = 306).                                 The task in which students retraced their path on a map
was not included in the environmental score due to a ceiling effect. There is no significant correlation between
a(rny=of the spatial .19, p > .10) scores and students' prior knowledge of course material, or course performance, as assessed by course grades (r =as.r2e3p8o,rpte>d on the self-questionnaire, .10); therefore, observed
differences cannot be attributed merely to student mastery of the stack contents prior to the study.

Correlations     Among      Spatial                           Measures

The two separate environmental cognition measures were highly correlated (r=.365, p < .05) as were the
psychometric     two-dimensional                             and three-dimensional        spatial  visualization scores     (r=.44, p<.05).  The
psychometric 2-D and 3-D visualization measures were also significantly correlated with the psychometric
spatial reasoning measure (r=.34 and r=.362 respectively, p < .05). However, neither of the environmental
cognition measures are significantly correlated with any of three psychometric spatial ability measures.

Hypermedia       Questionnaire

Students in the map condition reported learning more from the hypermedia program and considered it more
useful than students in the menu condition (mean values of 4.71 vs. 4.16;                                     marginally significant at p < .10).
However, there is no significant difference in how they perceived the utility of the tools associated with their
systems (e.g., global/local maps in the map condition and menus/pop-up card links in the menu condition).
There is an interaction between general spatial ability and stack condition on a "lostness" measure (F=5.64,
p<.05; [see Fig. 2]). Students higher in spatial ability were more likely to report a feeling of disorientation
while navigating through the menu-like system.

orientation.)

Hypermedia       Logs

There is an   interaction between                             spatial  ability  and use   of a   particular navigation    tool for the number of
questions answered    (F  = 6.83, p                           <  .05); menu     students  higher   in spatial ability    worked through as  many
questions as (both high and low spatial ability) students in the map condition [see Fig. 3].                                       There is also a

                                                                                                                                                  39
 difference in the number of cards visited by students in each system. Menu students who were higher in spatial
 ability tended to visit more cards, and more different cards, in both the search and browse modes [see Fig. 4].
 In accord with the greater number of cards that they visited, high-spatial students in the menu condition used
 significantly more                      card links   (pop-up menus) than low-spatial    students (r =  .478, p < .05). They also used the
 History menu more often for navigation, but they did not differ in their use of the Topics or Investigations
 menus  (r =  .467,                      p <  .05).   Two  main  topics  on the   first  question-Computer       Metaphor    and Cartesian
 Dualism-were listed on the History menu; and, while high-spatial students also used this menu slightly more
 in the browse mode (e.g., when not answering the questions), this may be due to familiarity gained in the
 search mode.

 In the map   condition,                      spatial  ability was   significantly   related to the    preferred use of   navigation tools.
 Navigation via the global map is negatively correlated                         with spatial ability (r = -.477, p < .05).   Further, while
 all students used the local maps for navigation equally often, the number of different local maps visited is
 positively correlated with spatial ability (r = .526, p < .05; [see Fig. 5]).

Concept   Maps

Students in the menu condition used more subgraphs in their concept maps than students in the map condition
(mean of 4.05 vs. 2.45; r = .328, p < .05).            Students included the same number of concepts in their concept
maps; however, there is an interaction between general spatial ability and stack condition in the number of
links that students used to connect these concepts (F=9.21, p<.05).                      High-spatial students in the menu
condition represented more primary and secondary links in their concept maps (r = .44, p < .05); however, their
proportion of actual stack links is not higher than the other students' proportion ([see Fig. 6]; primary links
exist when one can jump directly from one concept to another, and secondary links exist when two concepts
share a primary link with a third concept, but not with each other).

Psychometric   Spatial          Ability       vs.    Environmental           Cognition

In general, the observed differences in performance were correlated with a specific spatial skill depending upon
the navigation method.  In the menu condition, the differences in performance observed in the questionnaire
responses, logs, and concept maps are more closely correlated with psychometric spatial ability measures than
with environmental cognition scores.          Differences in navigation behavior with the map hypermedia system are,
by contrast, more highly correlated with the map students' environmental cognition scores.

                                                                                                                           41
 General     Discussion
 Hypermedia environments that are systematically designed in accordance with a theory of how the information
 will be processed, mentally represented, and later used will be easier to work with and afford greater educational
 benefits [Shapiro & Diehl   1994]. Although  elements   of general theories of cognition can be linked to broad
 design   features of instructional hypermedia    (e.g., learner control, multiple representations,  scaffolded
 interaction), the design of specific support structures and guidance tools should be selectively informed by
 research focusing on developments in specific areas of cognition such as memory, strategy use, metacognition,
 language, motivation, spatial ability, and problem solving.

 Spatial  Cognition      and Navigation   in   Hypermedia

 A hypermedia environment is generally taken to be spatial; if this were true, it would appear that much of our
 knowledge about spatial cognition and navigation in the real world could be applied to the design of
 information structures and navigation tools that can prevent learners from getting "lost in hyperspace." This
 paper presents results from an investigation into the relationship between various spatial abilities and the use
 of instructional hypermedia systems.  Measures of psychometric spatial      ability and environmental cognition
 were found to be partially, but not significantly, correlated.  The general findings of this study indicate that
 there is a relationship between general spatial ability (as measured by both psychometric spatial tests and
 environmental cognition tasks) and how students perceive and use hypermedia navigation tools, but the
 particular influence of spatial visualization/reasoning and environmental cognition on student performance with
 hypermedia systems may depend upon the specific navigational tools and information structures represented in
 the system's interface.

 Differences in performance were correlated with a specific spatial skill depending upon the navigation method.
 When working with the menu-like hypermedia system, differences in spatial visualization and reasoning
 appeared to influence student performance more than differences in environmental cognition.     This may be due
 to the fact that no structured graphic visualization for the menu system was provided, and it was necessary that
 students construct their own cognitive map of the connections among the information in the system.    Students
 with less spatial visualization skills appeared to have more difficulty in integrating the information in the
 stack; they provided fewer answers to questions than any other students, while visiting as many cards. When
 working with the map-like hypermedia system, differences in environmental cognition appeared to influence
 student performance more than differences in spatial visualization.    In this case, a two-dimensional spatial
 representation of the system's interconnections was provided, but students used various strategies to take
 advantage of the tool.

 Students in the map condition reported that they learned more from the program even though the utility of the
 navigation tools was reported to be similar across the two conditions. However, the navigation tools were the
 only differences between the two stack conditions; therefore, it appears that the navigation method influenced
 students' perceptions of the hypermedia environment. This influence is reflected in the self-reported ratings of
 "lostness." While searching or browsing through the menu-like hypermedia environment, students with high
 spatial ability were more likely to report a feeling of not knowing where they were in relation to other
 information-or not knowing how to get to some information.      This disorientation may result from the greater
 number of cards that these students visited (more than any other subgroup of students); that is, this group of
 students may have felt less secure in the knowledge of the system structure and how to navigate it because they
 had to construct a much larger mental map of the system's contents.  However, these students also relied more
 on the primary menus for navigation than did the low-spatial students in this stack condition.  So, when using
 a system with high-cognitive overhead (i.e., menu for spatial guidance) students with high-spatial ability
 appear to seek out navigation tools and information structures that are more structural in nature to aid them in
 constructing a cognitive representation of the environment.

 Summary

 The findings  from   this study suggest that the use of  graphical map-like    navigation tools in instructional
 hypermedia influences the perception of the system and the interaction with the system for students varying in
 spatial ability.  Students using map-like navigation tools developed a more integrated representation of the

42
material in the system; their concept maps of the system contents were more connected across topic areas and
they answered more integrative questions than low spatial ability students working with less spatial navigation
tools.   Students with higher spatial ability were less directed in their use of the less-spatial, menu-like,
hypermedia system; they visited more cards but did not answer more questions. This may indicate the use of a
more spatial representation of a hypermedia system with map-like navigation tools.                It appears from this
analysis that a student's ability to take advantage of hypermedia navigation tools is in some way related to their
ability to represent the environment spatially.         Systems using maps to structure the navigation may be
especially  useful     for students   with high-spatial    skills who seek  a  spatial  structure to the   information.
However, students with low-spatial skills seem equally able to take advantage of the structural benefits provided
by a navigation map.        In fact, students with lower spatial ability were more successful in task-oriented
activities (i.e., answering    integrative      questions) when    working  with   the  more graphically    represented
hypermedia environment.       These findings suggest that spatial navigation methods should be incorporated          into
menu-like instructional hypermedia systems to complement student spatial cognitive abilities.
