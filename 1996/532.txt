 1  Introduction

  Marcus1 is 27 years old, moved to Israel about a year ago, and is literate in his native language.    He learned the
  Hebrew alphabet when he arrived.    If you present an isolated letter to him, he will be able to tell you what it is.
  However,   when   he tries to identify those  letters  in large  units, namely,   words, he makes a consistent set of
  mistakes. He confuses:

                                            r.i (mem)         and    t:i (tet)
                                            n (chet)          and    n (tot)
                                            :i (bet)          and    ::, (chof)
                                            , (dalet)         and    , (reish)

    If you ask him why he confuses the mem and tet, for example, he will tell you that he thinks of both letters
  as having a flag coming out of the top, and that they look almost the same.          When pressed to guess what letter
 one of them is, he will almost always answer, "mem".
    Why should this happen?      I posit that the confusions can be understood,      and, through careful presentation of
 the letters of the new alphabet, avoided.    It is possible to learn the wrong features of letters-wrong in the sense
 that they don't uniquely identify the characters-and correct it over time.        But it takes a long time [Byrne, 1992],
 and in the meantime, it interferes with the other aspects of learning the language. While there are some situations
 in which it is better to learn from mistakes, this is not one of them. It is important not to learn them incorrectly in
 the first place.

 Learning to read a new alphabet is one of the first problems encountered when learning a foreign language.
 Studies suggest that when learning to read in a foreign language, learning the skills of mapping symbols to
 sounds (phonological    encoding)   [Eckwall        &  Shanker,   1983;   Lynch    &  Hudson,  1991] and letter-word
 recognition [Jones, 1981] are very important.         But they do not directly address how to acquire those skills.
 Those studies that do focus on letter learning, focus on transfer and generalization of features [Byrne, 1984],
 whether phonological encoding helps letter learning [Koda, 1989], and where the eye moves when learning a
 new alphabet [Koga & Groner, 1989].
    Little if any attention has been paid to the confusions that are commonly made among similar letters.        Some
 say the acquisition of distinctive visual features-for example, the features that distinguish the letters mem and
 tet-is essential to the process of learning to read [Gibson & Levin, 1975; Eskey, 1987].          Again, there are no
 suggestions for how to achieve this goal.
    My hypothesis is that when similar letters are taught together, the students are forced to see the important
 attributes that distinguish these letters. Otherwise, the student may focus on attributes that are not important--or
 worse-misleading, and it will take a long time to learn the correct features, or more precisely, to unlearn the
 incorrect ones.
    The overall goal of this research is to find out if there is at least one sequence of a given set of symbols-for
 example, the letters of an alphabet-that will allow them to be learned with minimal confusion.          In pursuit of
 this goal:

I.  An exploratory study has been done in which new learners of an alphabet read texts that were a little over their
    heads.  Briefly, they often pronounced a letter as if it were a similar counterpart.
2.  A model has been developed that simulates the process by which a person learns new letters.                    This attempts to
    answer the question: Why does the order of presentation make a difference?
3.  A survey has been done to determine which letters from various alphabets are considered similar.
4.  An experiment has been designed that will teach letters, grouped according to the results of the survey, to show
    that the phenomenon occurs.    I expect to find different confusions for different groupings.
5.  A computer simulation of the proposed model is being developed.                    I expect that this simulation will be able to
    predict the confusions people will make based on the grouping of the input letters.

The model, the survey, and the directions that they will take us is described in the remainder of this report.

2 A model of letter learning
When a group of letters is learned together, the learner attends to the features that differentiate among the letters
in the group.    Let us call these original features.              With practice, an automatic mapping is made from these
features to the sounds associated with the letters.                Without practice, they are not learned.   This agrees with
perceptual learning theory [LaBerge,  1975].                 For example, if the letters bet (:::i), mem (7:)), gimel (:,,), and chet (n)
are taught, the representation in memory will be something like the decision tree in Fig.              1. The tests contain the
features that distinguish between the letters.

    opens-to-the-left?         --1j-yes->!--no->          :itop-flag?--1j-yes->    !--no->twolegs?--1I-yes->   l
                                                                                                      --no->   n
                                 Figure 1. Features that distinguish between letters

   According to perceptual learning theory, the same thing happens when a second group of letters is presented.
However, this theory does not address what happens when the second group contains letters that are similar to
letters in the first group. Studies in object perception allow the subject to forget about previous sets when a new
one is presented.   This is not realistic-learning is cumulative; it does not happen all at one time.              My theory
says that new features have to be integrated with the original features, and that some old mappings have to be
forgotten.  But it is difficult to forget that the original mappings are no longer enough to distinguish all the
letters learned.
   An example of how Marcus learned mem and tet will clarify this process.                Marcus was presented a group of
letters that contained mem, such as in Fig. 1.               The characteristic that distinguished the mem from the other letters
was that it had a flag on top (the original feature).             Fig. 2a shows the representation of Marcus's memory, after
learning this first group of letters, for deciding if a letter is a mem.

    top-flag?     --1I-yes->     !--no->       top-flag?            --1j-yes->!--no->open-bottom?     --1j-yes->    
                                                                                                           --no->                         i,

                 a.  Learning     mem                                  b. Adding   tet  incorrectly
              Figure 2. Decision tree when mem and tet are not learned in contrast to one another.

   Marcus was then presented a second group of letters.                   This group contained a tet. In order to identify both
the mem and tet, Marcus needed to learn an additional new feature for the mem, that is, that the mem has an
opening on bottom.    However, Marcus had already learned the 'top-flag' feature; to this day, whenever he sees
either a mem or a tet, he thinks it is a mem.                My model says that this confusion is made because there is a 'bug'
in the representation of one node in Marcus's decision tree.              This is shown in Fig. 2b.
   Each node in these decision trees contains two items: a decision and a test.           Valid states for a node are:

                                                                                                                                                533
                      decision      = NIL                  or           decision    = beta
                            test      alpha                                  test     NIL

 However, when a node is changed incorrectly from the latter to the former, it can end up in a third, illegal state:

                                           decision           =  beta
                                                       test      alpha

    When identifying a letter without time pressure, the test leads to the next node in the tree, and a correct
 decision will be made.   But under pressure. the current node's decision will be accepted as the letter.
    The node that contained the decision mem in Fig. 2a needed to have two things done to it: add a test (open
 bottom), and remove the decision (mem).            However, the decision wa.s not removed because Marcus previously
 learned that 'top-flag' was the distinguishing feature for a mem.            The node mistakenly continued to make a
 decision. namely mem, when seeing a letter with the feature 'top-flag'.           My preliminary studies show that it is
 hard to unlearn this; the solution lies in ordering/grouping so as to avoid the problem in the first place.
    I hypothesize   that  the confusion  explained        in the  model  occurs  most often  when    reading  words.  When
 reading  words,   you want   to quickly  decide        what  all  the constituent letters are.    When   identifying letters
 individually, there is less pressure to quickly make a decision because other letters are not demanding your
 attention.  It is possible that the buggy decision node contains an item that alerts the person that a 'test' also
 exists, but it only appears when there is no time pressure for identifying the letter.      This observation needs to be
 more systematically tested.   If it is true, then a modification to the model will need to be made.
    I hypothesize that the first letter learned is always the decision reached when a confusion of this type occurs.
 If the confusion is more symmetric, that is, either of the confused letters is chosen randomly, then the model
 needs to be changed to reflect it. This will be tested in an experiment, which is described later.
    From the model we can infer that (I) novices will vary in the way they evaluate the similarity of a pair of
 letters (they have not yet decided which features are important to focus on); and (2) experienced users of an
 alphabet   will have different judgements          of similarity for  any given pair of   letters (they focus on different
 features of the letters, based on how they learned them).             An informal study showed that these phenomena
 actually occur.

 3 Letter similarity survey
 A survey was run to find out what letters people found similar for the purpose of grouping the letters in the
 experiment.    People were asked to rate the similarity of pairs of letters on a scale of O to 5 (see Fig. 3).        Two
 character sets were evaluated-the ASL fingerspelling alphabet (hereafter referred to as ASL), and the Japanese
 Katakana syllabary. The survey was run over the World Wide Web and required a graphical browser like
 Netscape.   For a description of how the survey was run, see [Underwood, in press]. The participants included
 people who read newsgroups about: teaching English as a foreign language, sign language, Japanese linguistics,
 foreign language laboratories, and linguistics.

                   Figure 3. Survey question: rating of the ASL letters "a" and "s", respectively.

    There are 325 pairs of letters in the 26-letter ASL alphabet.          These pairs were distributed into 5 files of 65
 pairs each to shorten the task for each evaluator.       People were generally not willing to do the survey if it would
 take more than IO minutes.    One of the files was randomly chosen and sent to each evaluator.            Because of this,
 some files were rated more often than others.         Each pair in the ASL alphabet was rated on average by      16 people
 (ranging from 7 to 2 I). Three types of people rated the pairs-on average, 8 who have Never seen them, 4 who
 have Played-with them, and 4.5 who are Serious users of the alphabet.                Not  enough    people  have rated the
 Katakana syllabary yet to come up with coherent results.

   People in the Never and Serious groups rated the same pairs of letters very differently.                                                                  This hints at two
things: (I) different features are attended to by each group, and (2) people who have seriously used ASL have
come to think of the letters differently than they did in the beginning.                                                            The graph in Fig. 4 shows pairs of letters

            Figure 4. Divergence of Never and Serious ratings for certain pairs of ASL letters

   In addition, people in the Serious group rated the same pairs of letters differently more often (33 pairs with
std dev >= 2) than people in the Never group (5 pairs with std dev >= 2).                                                                    This implies that Serious individuals
focus on different features in the letters than Never individuals.

4 Future Directions

Experiment: Does the grouping of letters affect learning?

An experiment will be run to see if the grouping of similar letters affects learning.                                                               The subjects will be adults
who are literate in their native languages and have no familiarity with the new alphabet.                                                              They will be trained on
the letters by a computer program.    The experiment will be run on two different alphabets.
   There will be two experimental groups, as shown in Tab.                                                       1.  Both groups will learn two sets of letters.       The
order of the sets will be different for half the subjects in each condition.                                                         "Similar letters" means that each set of
letters contains letters similar to each other.                                          "Dissimilar letters" means that each set of letters contains letters not
similar to each other, with similar counterparts in the other set.                                                   In the end, both experimental groups will have
learned the same letters. The groupings will be based on the results from the letter similarity survey.                                                             Sample
sets of letters using the Roman alphabet are shown in Tab. 1.

                                                                                                             set2: TISZVYFE

                                                                                                             set2: ORNHIZYE
                                                          Table 1.                                Experimental groups

   The letters will be taught over the course of two days.                                                     After the first session, the subjects will explain how
they identified each of the letters. These explanations will point to features that are attended to for all the letters.
The subjects will be tested after learning the two sets.                                                     The subject will read sentences made up of word-like
units, made up of letters from both sets, that are displayed on the screen in sentence format (a series of words)-
for example: DUM TOM IS SORN.                           Words and non-words in sentences, rather than individual letters, will be
used for testing in order to create a time pressure to identify the letters.                                                         This puts the subject in a more natural
reading situation, which is more likely to produce the confusions found in everyday identification of letters on
which this research is focusing.
   The model predicts that the first experimental group will learn the letters best (fewest mistakes in testing).
The second group will have problems because they will not be induced to focus on those features that would
distinguish the letters from their similar counterparts.

                                                                                                                                                                       535
  Predicting letter learning confusions

  Decision trees are used to discriminate between objects by asking questions.        Simon and Feigenbaum [1964,
  1984] used   a decision  tree, EPAM,    to model  object  discrimination in   long term memory.    They claim that
  discrimination is done by memory structures that are like decision trees.    Decision trees are used in areas such as
  artifact dating, pattern recognition, and speech recognition [Ur, 1994].
     I will use decision trees to simulate the model that is described earlier.   The feature descriptions of the letters
  of an alphabet will run through a program, grouped in different ways, as was done in the experiment.             The
  output will be a decision tree.  Each decision tree will be structured in such a way that it will be possible to
  predict exactly the confusions that will be made by subjects in the experimental groups.        This means that in
 some cases there will be "buggy" internal nodes, and in some cases there will not.    A correct decision tree will be
  able to generate the order and groups to teach letters that will create a minimal amount of confusion.    It can also
  manipulate the order so that particular confusions will be made.

 Letter descriptions

 The letters of the alphabets will be described in terms of the features that distinguish every pair of letters.    For
 example, a difference between the ASL letters "a" and "s" (see Fig. 3) is that "a" has a thumb extended upright to
 side of hand and "s" has a thumb bent across hand.         In fact, both letters also have ail four fingers bent over
 against the palm.  But this feature is not important for distinguishing between these two letters.    If ail letters in
 the alphabet were distinguished only by the position of the thumb, then that is the only feature that would be
 necessary to attend to in order to learn the entire alphabet.  A learner of the ASL alphabet would not be aware
 that this was not the case until more letters were seen.
     These descriptions will be produced by humans, based on data taken from the experiment.       There has to be a
 way to simplify this arduous task, otherwise this decision tree software will not be useful.

 5  Theoretical background
 There are a few theories that explain how to view Jetter learning as feature-based recognition.       These include
 prototype theory,  skill  acquisition,   analogy and   similarity, and object  perception.  Only  the latter will  be
 addressed here; a preliminary review of the other theories has been done, but it is not ready to be presented.

 Object perception

 Research in the representation of object perception shows that the features of letters that are perceived are not
 only at the lowest level (structuralist) or at the highest level (Gestalt), but also Jay somewhere in between, and
 most likely are organized hierarchically [LaBerge, 1975; Palmer, 1977].      LaBerge [1975] says that perception of
 objects occurs in stages:

 1.  Feature discovery stage.    Attention is paid to features that distinguish one object from another-for example,
     if a letter has an opening. Results from Palmer's [1977] experiments agree.
 2.  Coding.   Features are combined with the relations between them-for example, 'flag' is a feature, 'on top' is a
     relation.
 3.  Automatic coding.    Features and relations are chunked into single units.

     My  model   of letter learning    generally agrees with  these   guidelines. My  model  extends   this theory  by
 focusing on   the confusions    that are made   during the iteration of the stages  when   more features   need to be
 attended to in order to discriminate between letters.

6 Modelling and Simulation: Related work
There have been quite a few attempts at modelling letter learning.   Some researchers use hierarchical clustering
of features. Palmer [1977] built a model that successfully predicts the features that people consider salient in the
domain of artificial stick-like orthography. It does not address more general objects-for example, letters with
curves-and has a limited definition of "feature" (a 3-segment portion of a stick figure).          Palmer's work only
addresses salient features when one "letter" is seen, and not when more than one item is seen at one time.        The
current research addresses this, and in addition, it uses real letters in all their complexity.
    Many researchers have used neural networks to model letter recognition [McGraw et al., 1994; Fukushima,
1992; Seidenberg and McClelland, 1989].      Neural networks are good at generalizing from noisy data, that is,
discovering prototypes. But they get confused when two letters are similar-they think one is a noisy version of
the other. Using decision trees for the simulation in the current research will help to deal with this problem.
