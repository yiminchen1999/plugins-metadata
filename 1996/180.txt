               Abstract:   This report describes an adaptation of the Practical Algebra Tutor, "PAT," for
               college-level  developmental   mathematics, and initial evaluations   of PAT at two     college
               sites.  PAT is  a software learning environment   that    presents students with     real-world
               problem   situations,  modern   mathematical   representational    tools   to  analyze    these
               situations, and constant background   support from a "cognitive       tutor"-- an   intelligent
               computer tutor based on the ACT theory of cognition.       Previous   classroom     evaluations
               showed that  high-school students using   PAT outperformed   students   in regular  classes by
               15% on standardized tests, and by 100% on assessments of authentic problem-solving.          In
               two  colleges,  PAT students performed more than    50%    better  than  students    in regular
               classes on  a  performance-based  assessment.    This assessment   requires    students  to use
               mathematical   representations to analyze a real-world problem    situation.   It captures  the
               reform objectives of the PAT   approach, which are consistent  with   new  national  standards
               for mathematics.

 The   Educational     Problem

           Developmental mathematics courses, defined as college-level courses prior to calculus, are the fastest
 growing post-secondary mathematics courses in the nation.         From    1965   to  1985,   total enrollment  in  college
 mathematics courses increased 60%, while enrollment in college courses in high-school algebra and geometry
 increased by 250%     [Madison & Hart 1990].    Developmental mathematics courses          present unique    challenges  for
 instruction, but  instructors currently have limited resources with     which    to meet    these  challenges.  Based on
 input from developmental mathematics instructors, administrators, and publishers, we have identified a profile of
 the  developmental    mathematics   student  population   that has    served  to    focus   our   efforts at  instructional
 innovation. Developmental mathematics students tend to have one or more of the following characteristics: (1)
 high  variability in  age and  prior mathematical   background;     (2) a prior  history    of  failure and  frustration in
 mathematics; (3) a fragmented, proceduralized understanding of mathematics; (4) a lack of appreciation for the
 direct importance of mathematics to their lives; and/or (5) poor study skills, particularly, little awareness of how
 crucial it is to spend time working through problems if one is to succeed in mathematics.                 Thus we need an
 instructional solution that can adapt to the individual background of students, that offers a success experience,
 that interrelates various mathematics skills   during problem-solving,    that makes mathematics          meaningful,   and
. that can compensate for poor study skills.   Also, despite their poor mathematics        skills,  many   students enrolled
 in developmental courses declare college majors that depend heavily on mathematics (e.g., economics, biology,
 physics). Thus we need an instructional solution that prepares students for higher-level mathematics courses and
 that focuses on the application of mathematics to a variety of fields.
           In this article we report on the use of a technological tool that addresses these problems.         A computer
 based environment for learning algebra has been developed through a collaborative effort between cognitive
 psychologists, computer scientists, and educators at the Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutoring (PACT) center
 of Carnegie Mellon    University. Here we present the initial results of an ongoing experiment          that integrates this
 computer-based environment into developmental algebra courses at two college sites.

A  Solution:     Intelligent    Computer      Tutors

Cognitive       Tutors

         Cognitive tutors are a type of intelligent computer tutoring system well suited to the unique challenges
of teaching developmental mathematics [Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger & Pelletier 1995).                   They have at their
core a fine-grained computer model of the knowledge, skills,            and strategies involved in       competent    student
problem solving in the subject-matter domain.         That is, within the tutor is     a simulation,     developed through
psychological research,    that can solve   mathematics problems in        the ways we expect students to          solve  the
problems, as well as simulate the kinds of mistakes that students make.
         Cognitive   tutoring   technology    is grounded in     the   ACT   theory   of  cognition,     perhaps   the most
comprehensive, empirically tested and      influential of  all contemporary     theories  of  human     learning   [Anderson
1993). Two key premises of the theory that are particularly relevant to developmental mathematics are that (1)
learning occurs in the context of a problem-solving activity, and (2) learning events occur at a grain size well
captured by ACT's production rule notation.
         Like   much    computer-based    instruction, cognitive    tutors   allow  for  self-paced    use.    Unlike  other
approaches, the cognitive model within the tutor facilitates three additional forms of customized instruction:            (1)
Individualized  feedback and advice can be    supplied as  a student   solves  a   problem;   through    a  technique  called
"model tracing" [see Anderson, Boyle, Corbett & Lewis 1990), the tutor uses a student's behavior to identify the
chosen   solution path and prompts      the student    appropriately;  (2)   The   number    and   types   of  problems   are
individually selected to maximize learning opportunities;        using "knowledge tracing" [see Corbett &           Anderson
1992), the tutor follows the student's knowledge acquisition process and selects problems based on a student's
past successes and failures in    applying each individual skill    and strategy   in the  model;    and  (3)  it is easy to
customize the   tutors  fo r particular courses; this  is  important   both  because   there    is great variation   between
developmental mathematics courses and because college teachers want to put their own signature on the courses
they teach.
         Many laboratory studies have investigated the effects of cognitive tutors on student learning, and the
success of these systems has also been demonstrated in real classrooms [see Anderson et al. 1995).                In addition,
significant gains in    student attitudes and in  positive   teacher   behaviors,  including    acting  and   being  seen by
students more as a facilitator than as an authority, have been reported in         classrooms      using a  cognitive  tutor
[Schofield, Evans-Rhodes & Huber 1990).          In this   paper we    focus on  a  cognitive   tutor   called the   Practical
Algebra Tutor, or "PAT". In a previous evaluation of PAT in high school algebra classes, students using the
tutor with  a reform curriculum   performed 100%      better on  assessments   of problem       solving  and   representation
use, and 15% better on standardized tests than students who followed a traditional curriculum without the tutor
[Koedinger, Anderson, Hadley & Mark 1995].          In this  paper   we   present  the initial  results  of   an  experiment
integrating PAT into developmental algebra courses at two universities.

Curriculum      Reform

         The    current emphasis  in    mathematics  reform    efforts is on   the use  of   multiple   representations   and
computational tools     to solve difficult real-world problems      that  involve   symbolic    expressions.      The  PAT
curriculum   is consistent   with reform  efforts at   the high  school    [NCTM      1989)   and   new    standards  of  the
American Mathematics Association of Two Year Colleges [AMATYC 1995).                   The emphasis in PAT        is less on
symbol   manipulation    and more  on   symbolization  as  way   to  unleash   the power     of mathematics    for   problem
solving.  [Fig. 1) shows the PAT screen after completion of a problem.             For a more complete description of
PAT see [Koedinger et al. 1995). Here we illustrate three key features of PAT:
         (1)  While PAT covers the      traditional content of beginning algebra      (e.g., linear functions,    systems of
equations), these skills are introduced in the context of authentic, realistic problem-solving tasks.          The problem
in Figure 1 involves    using systems    of equations to   compare the cost of two      car  rental  companies,     Avis  vs.
Hertz.  One goal is to find the circumstances under which one company is more cost effective than the other
(Answer: rent from Hertz when traveling less than 750 miles).
         (2) PAT provides computerized computation and visualization including a tabling tool, (see upper-right
of [Fig. 1)) a graphing tool (lower-left) and an equation solving tool (lower-center).          By allowing manipulation

                                                                                                                          181
 of algebraic functions through the use of multiple representations, the tutor promotes deeper understanding of
 the meaning of the symbolic expressions [Kozma 1993].       One component of the college algebra        curriculum    that
 is critical to future mathematics success is skill in judging when two algebraic functions are equivalent.         With
 the multiple representations that are in our current system a student could, for example, use a table to check
 when the two functions produce the same output       for the same   input,  see where the    graphs   of the  functions
 intersect, or use symbolic manipulation to solve the equation of the two functions.
         (3) Instruction promotes instance-based investigation, a flexible problem-solving strategy often used by
 competent problem solvers to support their use of abstract mathematical formalisms as they attempt to make
 sense of a difficult problem [Koedinger & Anderson 1990] [Koedinger & Anderson 1995].               PAT promotes the
 use of this strategy by asking students to   first investigate  concrete instances  of unknown     values,  e.g., "How
 much would you owe each company if you drove 500 miles?" see row 2 of the Worksheet in [Fig. I].                   After
 answering the questions, they attempt to formulate the abstract rule, see the "Formula" row of the Worksheet in
 [Fig. I]. Instance-based investigation can lead students to solutions, particularly in problems requiring a discrete
 decision (e.g., from which company does it cost less to rent a truck?) as do many real-world problems.

 Assessment     of  Learning    Environments

 Monitored     Design

         [Brown    1992] has   stressed that success  in the  learning  sciences    requires  going  beyond    laboratory
 instructional experiments  to face the  complex    issues of  engineering   instructional   solutions   in real learning
 environments. Instructional design should (I) be guided by theoretical principles, (2) address multiple facets of
 instructional innovation, for instance, teacher training in addition to integrated technology use, (3) be evaluated
 in terms of the instructional objectives of multiple stake-holders, and (4) be made practically feasible so as to be
 easily disseminated.  A point not enough emphasized in [Brown       1992]   is the importance   of having   comparison
 conditions against which to evaluate the design.     In this study, for instance, we monitored outcomes both           in
 classes using PAT and in comparable classes without PAT.         These results will provide a baseline to monitor
 design improvements of future iterations in studies planned for the 4 semesters and summer sessions between
 now and the summer of 1997. We call our approach to design experimentation "monitored design" to emphasize
 the close monitoring of outcomes that guide the iterative design process and provide a database for justifying the
 future dissemination of PAT.

 Overview    of  the   Experiment

         This   experiment is  part of a monitored   design process of  an   instructional solution  that   addresses  the
 challenges of teaching developmental algebra.      The  tutor   was implemented     in  a total  of 11  classes   at  two
 universities. Within University P we controlled for teacher, curriculum and computer tool use, in that the same
 teacher taught the comparison class using     the   traditional curriculum     and the  experimental    class   with  the
 traditional curriculum and the cognitive tutor.    Within   University  L   we    controlled only   for curriculum    and
 computer tool use.
         We were interested in  two  major   outcomes    of student  learning:  (I) algebraic manipulation     skills, the
 goal of a traditional curriculum, and (2) use of these skills as well as alternative algebraic representations (e.g.,
 tables and graphs) to analyze and solve real-world problem      situations, the   goal of   the PAT   curriculum.     To
 assess these outcomes we   used a  performance-based assessment that    targeted   students'  problem-solving     skills,
 qualitative reasoning, and ability to communicate effectively about mathematics, as well as traditional algebra
 exams.  We also assessed students' attitudes toward mathematics and computers before and after working with
 the tutor.
         This   evaluation differed from the  previous   evaluation  of PAT     at  the high  school  level  [Koedinger,
 Anderson, Hadley & Mark 1995] in two ways:          (I) in this experiment, PAT was added to a traditional rather
 than a reform curriculum, and (2) the performance-based assessment was used in comparison classes as well as in
 the experimental classes.

 Experimental         Evaluation

 Design

           At  University P, one     comparison class   (n = 16)    studied a   standard  beginning   college   algebra
 curriculum, and one experimental class (n = 12) studied the same curriculum with the same instructor and also
 used the PAT cognitive tutoring system.     At University L, three comparison classes (n = 88) studied a standard
 curriculum, and six experimental classes (n = 199) used PAT along with the same curriculum.          The nine classes
 were taught by a total of five different instructors, none of whom taught both an experimental and a comparison
 class.

 Student    Population

           The    two  Universities  have  a  large   developmental    mathematics   curriculum.      Reflecting   the
 demographics of their respective cities, a large portion of University P's student population is African American.
 University   L's student population   is more  diverse and   includes a large portion   of Hispanic   students.  The
 students' mean scores on the Mathematics portion of the SAT were 419 (University P) and 395 (University L).

 Procedures    and    Curricula

           At University P the course met for 15 weeks, 4 days per week, 50 minutes per day.          During 11 class
 sessions,  students in experimental  classes met  in the computer lab    and worked on   3 word problems    with  the
 tutor. At University L the course met for 15 weeks, 3 days per week, 75 minutes per day.             During 10 class
 sessions, students in the experimental classes met in the computer lab and completed up to 15 problems with
 the tutor.   The cognitive  tutoring  software   was stored  on  a server  and  accessed   by  students  from   Apple
 Macintosh machines.     The computer lab was also accessible to students outside of class time.       Students were
 encouraged to use cognitive tutors outside of class, for remedial tutoring, completing unfinished lessons, and as
 homework when directed by the instructor.    More students used the     tutor outside of class  time at  University L
 than at University P.
           The tutor  curriculum covered solving    linear equations,  graphing,  slope-intercept  graphing,    finding
 unknowns with equations, and solving and graphing systems of equations, all within situated problem-solving
 scenarios.    Classroom   instruction    covered traditional algebraic   symbol  manipulation,    e.g.,  simplifying
 equations, factoring,  logarithms,  and  inequalities.  During the last  week   of class,  all  students were given
 approximately 20 minutes to work on the performance-based assessment.           Students   also took  a  Final  Exam
 covering traditional algebraic manipulation. Students completed the attitude survey before and after the course.

 Outcome      Measures

 Performance-based        Assessment:     "The    Cellular    Phone    Problem"

 Given  pencil and paper (and at University  P    optional use of a graphics calculator) students  are asked  to  do a
 mathematical  analysis of two  cellular  phone services,  given  a basic monthly   charge and a  rate per  minute   of
 usage for each service.  The problem was    contextualized   as a requirement  given  by   a  "boss"  to a "company
 employee" (the student).    The goal   was  for  the employee   to decide  which cellular  phone  service  would    be
 appropriate for officers of the company, based on the amount of time each officer uses the cellular phone.       The
 basic elements required for the "mathematical analysis" were clearly listed in the problem statement:     (a) defining
 variables, (b) writing equations, (c) making tables, (d) constructing graphs, (e) finding slopes and intercepts, and
 (f) finding points of intersection. Additional problem-solving tasks were presented as criteria suggested by the
 boss, e.g., that the analysis should: (g) specify the amount of usage each service allows for a total cost of $100,
 and (h) state the range of usage for which each service is cheapest.

184
        The problem context stated that the employee will have to make decisions based on the analysis shortly
after the boss would provide the necessary information on each officer's normal phone usage.                                 This implicitly
encouraged students to produce a graph of the two functions from which values can be read off quickly.
        Performance was evaluated by breaking the Cellular Phone Problem down into eight component tasks
that corresponded to the above eight requirements of the problem statement (a-h).         A single researcher assigned
each student's   solution a  score  of 0, 0.5,   or 1 point  on   each component,    based on                         predetermined    criteria.
Component scores were analyzed separately and were also averaged together to produce an overall mean score for
each student that ranged between O and 1.

Final  Exam

        The    final covered     traditional symbolic   manipulation      skills,  including                         solving    equations  and
inequalities, evaluating  logarithmic  expressions,   simplifying  equations,  and  graphing                         the equation   of  a line.
Problems   were  presented   as mathematical   expressions   without   context (no   word                         problems),    and no  verbal
responses were required. A typical problem was:
                          Factor    this     expression:          x3y   - 3xy     +  x2                         - 3

Attitude    Survey

        The survey was adapted from two existing surveys [Kloosterman          &    Stage 1992][Nickell                         & Pinto   1986]
and contained 50 items presented in a random order.      Items comprised 6 subscales that assessed students':                               (1)
lack of computer  anxiety,   (2) belief that  effort  contributes to  successful  mathematical                         problem-solving,     (3)
belief that skill in mathematics is useful in life, (4) belief that there are word problems that cannot be solved by
following  a set step-by-step   procedure,   (5) confidence in  their  own   ability to   solve                        difficult mathematics
problems, and (6) belief that word problems are an important component of mathematics.                                   The first subscale,
lack of computer anxiety, was made up of 20 items, the 5 mathematics subscales contained 6 items each.                                     All
responses were made on a five point scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree."

Results

Problem-solving       Ability

        On the performance-based assessment, students in the experimental groups scored higher than students
in the comparison groups overall see [Tab. 1], last row.       On  two   of the   eight  component                          scores, Making   a
Table and Stating the Ranges of Usage, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups at
both universities, with the experimental group outperforming the comparison group.                                    On    the remaining   six
component scores, Defining Variables, Solving for y = $100, Writing Equations, Finding Slopes and Intercepts,
Constructing   a Graph,   and Finding     Points  of  Intersection there  were    significant                        differences between    the
experimental and comparison classes at University L, but not University P.           This                         is likely due  to a  lack of
statistical power at University P, given the smaller number of students participating at that site.

Traditional    Algebraic     Skills

        The scores of students in the experimental and comparison classes on the departmental final exams did
not differ significantly  at either university    (Fs <  1).   This    shows   that  the  reduced lecture                        time   in  the
experimental classes (because some lecture periods were spent in the computer lab instead) did not detract from
the experimental students' acquisition of the algebraic manipulation skills targeted by the exams.

 Attitudes   Toward     Computers      and  Mathematics

          In general, students at both universities reported a positive attitude toward mathematics and computers,
 one that changed   little prior to and   following   instruction.  After instruction,  attitudes  of students  in the
 experimental group at   University P  tended  to  differ from those   in the  comparison  group   on  two  subscales:
 Students who   used the   tutor had  slightly less   computer anxiety    than comparison  students   (M(exp.)  =  2.4,
 M(comp.)  = 2.6,  one-tailed t  = 1.99,  p <  .05)   and they were  more  likely to believe   themselves  capable  of
 solving time consuming mathematics problems (M(exp.) = 2.3, M(comp.) = 2.6, one-tailed t = 1.58, p = .06).

Discussion

          Overall, results  showed that   students who  used the   PAT  tutor  solved the Cellular Phone  Problem,   a
 real-world application of algebra, more accurately than comparison classes.      Using the tutor did not negatively
 affect students' ability to perform traditional symbolic manipulation, as demonstrated by their final exams, or
 their attitudes toward mathematics or computers.     However, there is much room left for improvement, especially
 on higher-level tasks such as judging the range of airtime for which each cellular phone service is the cheapest.
          There was some evidence that students using the tutor had a better understanding of problem goals in
 that they were better able to state the range bf values for which each cellular phone service was the cheapest.
More students in the comparison classes seemed to believe that the problem goal had been met when they had
 solved the equations and found that one service allowed a greater amount of phone time for a total cost of $100.
 However, the functions describing the total cost of each service intersect, creating two ranges of values.     Basing
 a decision about the "best" cellular phone service on a single point does not take this fact into account.
          The current developmental mathematics curriculum over-emphasizes formal skills to the detriment of
useful algebraic skills.   The   need for reform   in algebra  courses is made   particularly salient by the   contrast
between the large amount of time spent on helping students master skills of limited applicability, like factoring
 expressions in the final exam   problem    illustrated above, and  the   poor performance  of students  on  applying

186
algebra to   problem  situations.  Less than     7%  of the 215   students in  the traditional classes   in  this  evaluation
were able to make a reasonable conclusion about the Cellular Phone Problem.               Unlike the current situation i n
traditional algebra courses, we believe that useful algebra should lead formal algebra instruction, not lag behind
it.  Practical   problems    such as  those   the  tutor  presents  should    serve as   the   context   in  which    symbol
manipulation skills are learned.   By integrating PAT into reformed curricula that have this           objective,   we expect
to see even more dramatic learning gains that are particularly relevant to student retention and success in college.
Reform efforts should include the creation of new assessments, such as the Cellular Phone Problem, that better
reflect the students' future needs for algebraic representations and reasoning processes.
         Our future research will continue development and evaluation of PAT, focusing on student learning and
attitudes, and successful teacher behavior. We will work with universities to reform developmental mathematics
curricula, and strive to help teachers achieve maximal integration of the software into existing curricula.
