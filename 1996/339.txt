1.   Authoring      Tools     and     GBS    Builder

     As  educational software becomes more complex         and multimedia more     pervasive,   authoring   tools   become
increasingly central to the construction of instructional applications. Moreover, the importance of creating tools
that encourage effective instructional     design  is  now  widely  recognized.   In response to    this,  researchers   are
creating  sophisticated tools that not   only  support  the   mechanics   of software    design   but embody   models    of
pedagogy   as well, which    has led  to efforts  in  designing specialized  authoring    environments    around  specific
instructional frameworks.    To  better  support  the  design  process,   such  tools must    possess  knowledge    of   the
domain and of the kinds of tasks suited to that domain. This paper reports preliminary work in augmenting a
specialized authoring tool with task and domain knowledge. The tool supports the design of a specific class of
Goal-Based Scenarios that emphasizes investigation. The extension to this tool represents and applies knowledge
of investigations, in terms of both their structure and the objects that typically appear in them.
     Goal-Based Scenarios (GBS) [Schank, Fano, Bell, & Jona 1994] is a framework for simulation-based learn
by-doing instruction,  in which the learner is    engaged in   pursuing   a goal, within    a simulated environment,     in
order to master a set of target skills.    The student is an active participant in the scenario, assuming a role in
which resources provided by the program are available to help the student progress toward completing the task.
There  is a potentially  wide range of     programs that   could   be designed in   accordance    with  GBS    principles:
programs that allow students to build artifacts; programs in which the student controls a device or participates in
a process; programs   in  which   the student  conducts    investigations,  and  so   on. Because   we  are interested   in
creating tools that help designers create GBSs, it is important to design the right sort of tool for each class of
GBS, of which Schank, Korcuska, et al. (1996] have identified eight.
     A class of GBS called Investigate & Decide [Bell 1996] describes programs in which the principal focus is
on conducting investigations to gather information in support of a decision the student is asked to make. The
utility of the Investigate & Decide model would be amplified if the process of instantiating this class of GBS in
software were made less onerous. This is the motivation behind an authoring environment called the Goal-Based
Scenario Builder (GBSB)   [Bell  1996].   GBSB    is  a prototype  GBS    construction tool,  built   collaboratively by  a
team of researchers and developers at    the Institute for the Learning Sciences    [1].  The  purpose  of the tool   is to
allow  a domain  expert or teacher to     create  an   Investigate &   Decide   GBS,   without    requiring expertise    in
programming and instructional design. The tool employs the underlying model to govern the interaction, so that
the design process is carried out in a manner consistent with the organization of the model. Adherence to the
model helps a designer create a GBS that observes the principles embodied in the framework.

2.   Investigation      Knowledge          and     GBS     Builder

     The extent to which a tool can assist a designer is governed in part by the level of knowledge that the tool
possesses about the artifact being constructed. In considering the leverage that a tool like GBSB provides, we
must first ask what the tool "knows" about investigation and how that knowledge contributes to the tool's
design support  role. GBSB    includes   a   specification of the  investigation  task   as consisting  of  three   phases:
Obtain Sample, Analyze Sample, and Interpret Results. Within each phase, the model directs the interaction by
defining which  interface features are to  be elicited and in   what order. In Analyze Sample,        for instance, design
parameters elicited for running  a particular test    include the text to label the test  button,   a picture of  the  test

[I] Smadar Kedar and the author led the design effort, with guidance from Roger   Schank,   Chris Riesbeck, Ray Bareiss,
and Alex Kass. Steven Feist and Erica Dubach contributed their programming talents; Jaret Knyal supplied the interface
artwork.  A proof-of-concept  version of the tool, which preceded the prototype,    was created by the    author, Michael
Korcuska, and Edward Lim.

                                                                                                                       339
 device in its start state, that picture's caption,   a picture  of the   test after it has   been   run, and that  picture's
 caption.  These   elements,  and   their   ordering,   constitutes   the model's    "knowledge"      of  the  structure   of
investigations.  While   this model is     sufficient for   guiding the   designer   in  supplying    all  required interface
 parameters, it obviously limits the program's ability to assist in creating the investigation.
      Empirical studies of GBSB [described in Bell 1996] suggest that users find the interface orientation of the
 tool to  be of  significant, but  limited  value. A    common      reaction   among    users was that    the tool  lacked a
 conceptual perspective, that is, the guidance it provides is strictly interface-oriented. While the model specifies
 in detail which objects must be defined, it does not specify much about the relationships among those objects or
 about the criteria for defining an object.
      Why does this matter? The purpose of articulating a model in the first place is to embody a set of design
standards that a tool could help a designer observe. By expressing such standards in terms of interface elements
that  a designer must  specify,   the tool  has no basis    from which to    help a designer    make  intelligent   decisions
 about how to define these elements. The question is what additional knowledge would the tool require in order to
offer a  useful measure of   guidance  in  designing    investigations.   Two   kinds   of information    are relevant here:
 structural knowledge and domain knowledge.        Structural knowledge informs       the  designer  that  an  investigation
involves an analysis procedure, applied to some sample, and that the results of this procedure can contribute to
some    appropriate  conclusion.  Domain      knowledge   informs   a   designer that,  for example,    a  refractometer  can
determine  an   unknown     gem's  index   of refraction,   or that gas   chromatography      can  reveal  the   presence  of
substances used by arsonists to fuel a blaze.

3.    Representational        Primitives       for      Investigation          Knowledge
      Domain    knowledge,   that is, pertaining   to   the kinds of    components   likely   to appear   in  investigations,
includes knowledge of the components themselves (e.g., that a thermometer measures temperature), as well as
knowledge of the     relationships among      them (e.g.,   that atomic   absorption    detects  the presence  of  elemental
metals).   Both  of  these  kinds  of  information      can  be   sufficiently  represented   using   a   taxonomic    frame
representation, as in Figure 1.

                                 Figure 1: Example definition for subclass of TEST

      Structural knowledge is codified as an investigation template. A template contains four elements: sample,
test, result,  and outcome.   A   complete    template  specifies   the   types of   objects  which    will   be part  of  an
investigation   sequence. Each can be associated with          specific scenarios.   An  investigation    scenario  supplies
specific instances for the objects named in the template. If a template includes, for example, the outcome "cause
of death", then a scenario for this template might contain the outcome "drug overdose". A scenario thus defines
an explicit sequence of activity which a user of the resulting GBS would encounter.

4.   Structuring       and    Manipulating          Investigation         Knowledge

      The knowledge called for in the preceding section is encoded in an extension to GBS Builder, called the
Investigation Map, or /Map. The IMap consists of an editor for adding elements to an investigation, an advisor,
suggesting    ways   a designer   might   complete    a partially-defined  investigation,     and  a  knowledge     base  for
maintaining elements which designers may select for their investigations. A designer builds an IMap by creating
an investigation template, and then defining scenarios which specify specific paths through the template.                The
input the designer provides to the !Map thus includes the samples, tests, results, and outcomes populating a
particular investigation.

4.1.  Defining     an Investigation     in  IMap

     To illustrate a typical interaction, let us  consider an                   investigation in which  the student must  determine
whether or not a lake has become polluted. The first step is to create a template which defines an appropriate
type of investigation. The purpose of this investigation is to determine "cause of change in ecosystem", which
the designer selects to occupy the "outcome" part of the investigation template. The next item to fill in is what
kind of results will help determine a cause of change in ecosystem. The designer in this example intends for the
student to use the   level of dissolved oxygen   in the lake as                  a source for  this kind of evidence, and thus the
"result" part of the template is filled with "concentration dissolved gas" [Fig. 2].

                Figure 2: Selecting "concentration dissolved gas" as the investigation's result

The designer can then select the type of device which can measure this concentration (in this case, "dissolved
oxygen test"), and the type of samples which will be tested ("water sample"). The completed template occupies
the top row of the table in Figure 3.

4.2. Applying      Investigation  Knowledge         for   Design                   Support

As the designer creates the  investigation  (that is, the samples,                 tests, results,  and outcomes in  the template),
IMap can offers suggestions about how to proceed. A suggestion contains two kinds of information. This first
is syntactic advice, i.e.  indicating which part of the template should next be defined. The second form of
guidance which IMap offers is semantic, i.e.   recommending specific kinds of objects which would be                     consistent
with those already installed into the template. Figure 4 shows the guidance IMap offers to a designer who has
specified an outcome of "cause of change in ecosystem".

 4.3. The     Investigation     Library

      The  current   implementation    includes a modest          knowledge                                                                                  base  so that    IMap       may    offer  design  guidance
 about the objects in an investigation (i.e., the domain knowledge). The investigation library currently defines
 several hundred classes of objects which typically appear in the kinds of investigations generally conducted in
 secondary   science   classrooms. At        the   top   level, the      classes                                                                            are organized    according      to   !Map's  investigation
 model,   as samples,   tests, result, or       outcomes.      Within      each                                                                             category is  a   set       of class d efinitions, organized
 hierarchically. A portion ofthe hierarchy from             one such       category                                                                             is shown     in Figure     5.   Since  the tool should
 support as broad a range of investigations as is practical, the interface includes a knowledge acquisition mode
 which supports the addition ofnew definitions and modification of the existing knowledge. Adding a new class
 to  the  library is a matter  of indicating         its superclass,      and identifying                                                                            the classes        to which   this  new   class  is
 related.   The example in      Figure          6  shows   a   designer                                                                   modifying                 the  outcome           class "cause-of-change-in
 ecosystem", by adding "temperature" to the dependencies (list ofresults) relevant to this class ofoutcome.

      Determining what knowledge to include in !Map's initial knowledge based relied in part on the GBSs which
 had been constructed using GBSB (prior to IMap) [2]. The investigation elements included in those applications
 formed the   beginnings  of the   knowledge             base, which       was                                                              expanded                 by  generalizing        these elements    to   form
 broader categories until the top-level         categories     (sample,    test,                                                                            etc.) were reached.        Table 1   lists these GBSs   and
 the  kinds  of investigation   elements contributed            by       each.                                                              As               the   table suggests,         this  primitive    model  of
 investigation is likely to be sufficient for a reasonable range ofpotential applications.

In concert with the analysis of the available GBSs, a survey of the experimental activities typically included in
high school science curricula was conducted to guide the evolution of the knowledge base. Science laboratory
supplements were used  from Biology         [Brown     1978;  BSCS   1973a; BSCS                                       1973b;   BSCS     1990; Edwards   1975;
Kroeber 1965; Moore 1970], Chemistry [Ferguson 1978; Garrett 1966; McGill 1966; Metcalfe 1982; Sutman
1967], and Physics [Stollberg         1975; Taffel     1970; Williams 1973].                                     These   texts  supplied   information  which
shaped the sample, test, result, and outcome hierarchies.

6. Conclusion

    IMap  is an extension to   GBS Builder for         supporting  creation of                                   investigations      in Investigate &   Decide
GBSs. The IMap tool is a knowledge-rich editor, allowing a designer to instantiate investigation elements, and
also a help utility, able to make suggestions to ensure that the designer's investigation is consistent with its

                                                                                                                                                           343
 internal model. Motivating IMap are the obstacles typically faced in creating an investigation. This knowledge
 includes both a general component (a model of investigation), and specific knowledge about the elements within
 an investigation.
     IMap is a useful design aid because designers are more adept at imagining appropriate investigations than at
 conceiving of   all the necessary details   [3]. For example,    a  chemistry  teacher may express    a GBS   design  as
 "students will  learn   about oxidation by   being arson    investigators,   looking  for clues by   testing combusted
 materials." What is likely to pose more difficulty is turning that idea into a working system. IMap can assist
 designers who start with a broadly-framed idea by helping operationalize that idea as an investigation, turning
 the designer's  general  description   into an   explicit set of objects   and sequence of interactions  among    those
 objects. Another, pragmatic, aspect to !Map's utility is that it can reduce the effort needed to create the interface
 screens associated with the investigation. The knowledge representation in IMap includes default graphics and
 labels associated each class  that    are automatically inserted into  the designer's  investigation at the  appropriate
 locations in the interface.
     One area of   future work is   to  broaden   the representation  of investigation  elements,  so  that   IMap could
 supply  answers  to  standard questions about    parts of an  investigation,   for example "what   is this?", or  "what
 accounts for property X?". Another area      for  future  work   is in reusing  investigations. While   IMap  currently
 allows any class listed in the library to be selected for inclusion in an investigation, a more       powerful facility
 would allow for complete investigations to be retrieved that match the designer's objectives according to some
 appropriate similarity metric. The utility of IMap will hinge ultimately on the scope of its knowledge base, so
 knowledge acquisition tools that go beyond the current frame editors will be required. Finally, more complex
 models of investigation will be needed. The sample-test-result-outcome paradigm is a convenient simplification,
 but IMap will need to accommodate investigations in which, for example, two tests provide conflicting results,
 or an outcome depends on multiple tests. The implementation reported in this paper         establishes an architecture
 within which these extensions may be readily introduced.
