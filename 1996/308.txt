             Abstract:   In recent studies of students in intermediate computer science  courses, we
             have  noted a number of   misconceptions    and other learning  problems.   Supporting
             intermediate computer science students has not been explored in the literature as well as
             supporting novice and expert programmers. We are developing an approach focussed on
             providing   a cognitive apprenticeship   in computer  science. Our approach     has  four
             technological   components:  interactive notes  module,   a collaborative  tool, a case
             library and problem-solving  activities  accompanied  with  various scaffolding  features
             including annotated links to the other modules and drawing upon existing resources. Our
             first focus is on  undergraduate Computer Graphics where   we are beginning to   evaluate
             our materials.

I. Addressing      the   Problems      of   Intermediate        Computer         Science      Students

        In  recent studies of students in   intermediate Computer   Science courses (e.g.,    Computer    Graphics,
object-oriented programming), we have noted a number of misconceptions       and other   learning problems   (e.g., a
tendency to create too-centralized object-oriented   programs [Guzdial, 1995a]).   This  is   an  area  not as well
explored as support for Computer Science beginners and experts.    Solutions that have had success in    supporting
novice students include intelligent tutoring support [Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995], learning
environments based on structured editors [Miller, Pane, Meter, & Vorthmann, 1995], and learning environments
based on high-level   cognitive  structures with   supportive component libraries      [Soloway,    Guzdial,  Brade,
Hohmann, Tabak, Weingrad, et al., 1993]. Technologies that have had success with experts include intelligent
programming support such as the Programmer's Apprentice [Waters, 1981] and reusable component libraries
[Guindon & Curtis, 1988].
        Intermediate students do not have the knowledge necessary to take advantage of expert-level tools, yet
they are also already beyond many of the supports that have been successfully used with novices, e.g., structured
editors are less useful with students who have already been able to learn the syntax and semantics of two or
more programming languages. Two commonalities between the sets of approaches are:
    · Intelligent support for diagnosing and addressing problems.
    · Libraries of examples and components.
        One of the particular challenges of working with intermediate students is that they are already taking on
problems that are broader and deeper than those that novices take on.    Support for their learning problems   must
reflect that breadth and depth. The intelligent support must draw upon   a  large knowledgebase,   and the libraries
must be broad enough to encompass the kinds of needs that intermediate students will bring to it.

308
          Fundamentally, the approach that we are taking is to conceive ofintermediate Computer Science as a
kind of cognitive apprenticeship [Collins    et al., 1989]. We want   to   pro_vide students with   a  broad and deep
library ofresources, with intelligent support for identifying and using relevant resources. We also want to create
learning  communities    where  students can help  one   another and more  expert  students can  help  other   students.
Our approach centers around four pieces:
    · A collection ofresources which we broadly call Interactive Notes.     For   each intermediate    course, there are
      a  collection of resources already existing:   course notes, glossaries, quizzes,   visualizations, simulations,
      algorithm animations [Stasko, Badre, & Lewis, 1993], etc. We are collecting these and integrating them
      to  provide   breadth and depth beyond  the cases  themselves  [Carlson,  Guzdial,    Kehoe,  Shah,  &   Stasko,
      1996].
    ·  A    computer-supported  collaborative   learning tool, CaMILE     [Guzdial  et al.,  1996],  [Guzdial,  Turns,
      Rappin, & Carlson, 1995], which encourages collaboration with links to external resources.
    · A case library [Kolodner, 1993] ofrelevant stories and problems, told in a simplified form but within the
      context ofreal-world expert stories.
    · Problem-Solving Activities supported by      various  scaffolding features such  as  annotated links to  the  case
      library  and relevant  notes pages.  Scaffolding for accessing and using      the resources   is fadeable  to  be
      adaptable to the needs ofindividual students [Guzdial, 1995b].
          All three ofour tools are based on the World Wide Web, which eases usability and access problems.
Our   first efforts are  aiming at the undergraduate Computer      Graphics course     at Georgia  Tech,   and  we   are
beginning an effort in the introduction to object-oriented programming course as well.

II.   The    Interactive     Notes     Module

          The interactive notes   module is  in  advanced  stage of progress.  Notes   of the   introductory   computer
graphics course given at the College ofComputing at Georgia Tech are available in the project Web site, linked
with  interactive   elaboration pages  for  some   of the   topics (e.g., visualization    tools for   exploring    two
dimensional transformations). We work closely with instructors ofthis course in trying to gather two types of
data: (a) major difficulties and misconceptions students have in learning computer graphics and (b) usability and
attitudes   during  use. The problems    and  misconceptions     analyses are  based   mainly   on  corrected  students
assignments such as homework, programs, quizzes, and finals.
          In a survey conducted    among  students   of the introductory  computer   graphics   course during   its  last
offering, more than 70% agreed that the pages ofthe interactive notes module were good and useful overall.
However, only 20% agreed that the pages helped them to solve assignments in the course, and a relatively low
60% agreed that the pages helped them to study for the course. These results strengthen our beliefthat simply
providing resources is not enough to help students in using the knowledge from the course in their work, and
encourage us to develop the other modules in the system and link them together to provide a more effective
learning environment.

III.  CaMILE:        Collaborative       and     Multimedia        Interactive      Learning       Environment

          CaMILE is a Web-based collaboration tool which has been used in several courses outside ofComputer
Science [Guzdial, et al., 1996]. CaMILE provides a facility for students to discuss issues and share media [see
Fig. 1].  What makes CaMILE more supportive oflearning than newsgroup or electronic mail include:
    · CaMILE uses procedural facilitation (as in the CSILE system [Scardamalia, Bereiter, McLean, Swallow,
      & Woodruff, 1989]) to encourage reflection on the roles ofthe notes in the collaboration.
    · Threads ofdiscussions (a collection ofrelated notes) can be directly addressed as a kind ofsub-discussion or
      contextualized discussion.   Using this feature, an instructor can create a discussion on a particular topic
      (e.g., a new assignment) and create a link to that discussion, so that students using that link need not ever
      see the entire discussion and can instead focus on the relevant parts ofthe discussion.
    · Notes in CaMILE can be linked to any kind      of media,   both based on  the Web     and based on  the student's
      personal computer    (e.g.,  spreadsheets, drawings,  word-processing    documents).   This   linking  facilitates
      integrating diverse media and encourages students to contribute their own work in the collaboration.

IV. The Computer Graphics Case Library

         A prototype of a computer graphics case library has been completed. A case library is typically aimed
at storing previous cases in a domain for the sake of finding solutions to problems encountered in new cases. A
goal for this case library is to enable broad use. While we hope that experts might use it to find cases similar to
problems in which they are currently engaged, the central focus is for intermediate students to use the library to
learn about major problems in computer graphics.
         To broaden the stories in the case library, we use resources at the Graphics, Visualization and Usability
(GVU) Center at Georgia Tech and resources in the entire computer graphics community and invite users to a±l
new stories and lessons (i.e., lessons drawn out of the stories.) The contributions would be moderated by experts
and educators. Thus, the library is likely to be a live and growing casebase. Our hope is that the library might
become large enough to be useful for experts.           If we are successful, the use of the library and contribution of
new  cases   could ensure the real-world     characteristic  of this    learning   environment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        for learners. In addition,
educators' contribution of simplified stories and learning problems could serve as the library internal bridge
between students and experts.
         Each story in the case library may consist of important milestones in the development, intermediate
products, source code segments, visualization of different stages, tools, methods, etc. In a concurrent process we
are trying to draw  out  lessons   from  the incoming     stories    in a form    of  a  common                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       problem   accompanied  by
different solving  strategies. Thus,    each common       problem is      linked   to variety                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      of stories  that address this
problem. The incoming problems, issues, solutions and stories are then indexed to cover all major concepts and
terms in the domain.
         An example in our prototype is the story of a flight simulator aimed at people who suffer from fear of
flying [Hodges, Rothbaum, Watson, Kessler, & Opdyke, 1996]. The project is complex and entails the use of
many algorithms and methods in Computer Graphics. One of the general issues related to this story is Hidden
Surface Elimination and different solving strategies are Z-buffering, BSP Tree, Back-Face Removal, Depth-Sort
and the Scanline Algorithm.        Part of the     data described in the  story   is  as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "... our model contains a

The model as a whole contains 100,000               polygons,   with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      over 90,000  of them  used to
describe the terminal buildings. "      One of      the problems told     in  this   story is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     the phenomena     of 'Bleeding
Polygons' which is a result of using the Z-buffering method in such a model.                A learning problem (within the

310
problem-solving activities) associated with this story is: "What sort ofinadequacies with Z-buffering might this
sort ofmodel reveal?"
               In general, a specific lesson                          is  a common      problem   (or            a general issue)  along     with  its approaches,
solving strategies or solutions.                     When multiple                solutions   exist they             are presented in    a  table [see Fig.    2]  to
facilitate the      comparison of the                pros            and cons of each solution.       Thus,           while  each  story     might    have its  own
structure, lessons are presented in a more structured way.
               A searching mechanism with partial matching [Kolodner, 1993] is available for the user to search the
library.       Concept    maps   in              the  interactive             notes  and navigational              maps  in the   case   library   could   serve   as
alternatives for formulating a logical query with                                    index terms. Also, these maps might                       help in   getting   an
overview of the system content and structure.

V.  Problem-Solving                              Activities                 and      Scaffolding

               The educational use of the system can be done in several ways such as searching the case library or
browsing the interactive notes pages to learn about main issues and problems in computer graphics.                                                        However,
a more structured way of learning with the system is through the problem-solving activities. In this module, the
learner is able to select a learning problem from a repository of learning problems. Some of these problems are
derived form the case library stories. Thus, it is possible to challenge the learner to look for different solutions
by retrieving relevant stories from the library.                                 Part of the scaffolding mechanism is                    to provide   at  this point
annotated links to those relevant stories, links which might ease the finding and reading of significant portions
in each        story'. The same   concept              is             being   implemented     by  providing links            to   the    relevant pages    from   the
interactive notes        module  which,               from             the  point    of view  of  the            problem-solving   process,     can   be  seen  as a
resource of factual knowledge.                     All these               links are meant   to  support            the learner in his/her     effort  to solve   the
selected learning problem.
               Since lessons were drawn out of real-world stories, the learner has the opportunity to select a problem
that fits with his/her interest or need resulting in                              possible   increase of motivation             to learn     [Schank,    1992].   The
way a learning problem is presented to                                    the learner   [see Fig. 3]             has some   similarities    to the  problem-based
learning approach [Barrows, 1986]. The first two pieces are the facts and learning issues need to be explored.
The learner is         able to type-in            learning                issues or  get suggestions               from the system    by    accessing    one   of the

                                                                                                                                                                  311
 scaffolding features [see Fig. 4]. Learners can then request to access peer review . These peer solutions are based
on authentic answers taken from finals or other assessments in the computer graphics course. The answers were
 analyzed and selected as representatives of common problems and possibly misconceptions in understanding the
issue [see Fig. 5].

       We can characterize the scaffolding in the system as falling into three categories of software-realized
 scaffolding [Collins, 1990], [Collins, et al., 1989], [Guzdial, 1995b]:

    · Modeling or Communicating Process where students are helped with understanding the problem and what
     an expert's process might be.                    Examples of this kind of scaffolding features include:                [see Fig. 4]
          -    learning                issues:  links       to    notes     pages where     relevant   learning issues are discussed.                                                                                                                From   these
            pages, elaboration is available accompanied with many examples;
          - library    hints:                annotated       links         to story     portions of greater  importance  to solving                                                                                                                  the selected
            problem;
          - experts analysis: analysis of the                                problem     is provided   by at least two experts, to emphasize                                                                                                                 that
            there is usually more than one 'correct answer' ;
          - presentations:                    images,       animations,          movies     and  other kinds of presentations    that                                                                                                                support the
            understanding of the selected problem;
    · Coaching where                   students are provided               help   which     responds   to their  given  selections and                                                                                                                responses.
     Examples include:                  [see Fig. 5]
          - peer review: showing students incorrect/incomplete answers beside their own answer so                                                                                                                                                      that  they
               might be supported in identifying their own misconceptions;
          - visualization: tools that can aid in understanding basic issues such as a 2D visualization tool                                                                                                                                                  or a
               curve construction tool. Some of these tools might have their own unique interaction providing
               the learner with detailed feedback for his/her doing [Friedler & Shabo, 1989/90].
   ·  Articulating  where students                    are   provided with              opportunities  to express their solutions   and evaluations.
     Also, the articulation could lead to collaboration and the system facilitates this by enabling the students to
     post their articulations to relevant WebCAMILE discussion [see Fig. 3].

VI.     Summary

           The paper describes ongoing research to develop a cognitive apprenticeship approach to addressing the
 needs of the intermediate computer science student.          We are examining      the   potential    cognitive   benefits from
 integrating   the apprenticeship   model of    learning  and the   problem-based    learning    approach    in  a computerized
 framework on the Web.         Our  approach    involves  four  components:    interactive    notes    module,   a collaborative
 learning environment, a case library and problem-solving activities.
           We are currently engaged in formative evaluation of the system by trying it out with students from an
 advanced computer graphics course. The evaluation is based on log files which are created by the software and
 contain most      of the actions the student    has done  during   the  use  of the    system.  Also     we use   observations,
 interviews    and questionnaires to   collect data on     student's  attitudes towards      the    system   and   to get   deeper
 understanding on the ways the scaffolding features are being used in the problem-solving process.
