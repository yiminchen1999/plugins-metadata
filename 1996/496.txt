Introduction

       Multimedia technology allows information to be organized and represented in a wide variety of ways.        For
a computer-based educational environment    to be effective, the subject    matter must be  presented in a  clear and
comprehensible format.  Many multimedia applications organize information based on         its physical format,   i.e.,
sound clips, still images, text, and so on.    However it is  also   possible to organize  information based  on  the
learner's plan to use information.  Such "cognitive media types", media organized around cognition rather than
physical format, include definitions, examples, worked problems, and problem sets [Recker,Ram, Shikano, Li &
Stasko 1995).
       AlgoNet was an educational multimedia environment designed to test the effectiveness of these cognitive
media types.  Subjects using AlgoNet's cognitive media organization fared significantly better in a post-test than
those using a traditional physical media organization [Recker et al. 1995). While  AlgoNet did  show   that cognitive
media types helped students learn, how to best interface cognitive media types into a learning environment remained
an open question. AlgoNet2 was created in order to explore some of the possible interface options for supporting
cognitive multimedia. AlgoNet2 includes exactly the same domain information as AlgoNet, but with several new
enhancements that allow users to navigate more easily and keep better track of their progress through the system.
       In order to test AlgoNet2 in a real-life situation, we deployed the system in an introductory undergraduate
computer science class at the Georgia Institute of Technology.   The results of our study provide insights into the
factors important in the design of a computer-based educational environment.

The AlgoNet2 System

       The   AlgoNet2  program     is a prototype of an   educational   software   package incorporating multimedia
technology combined with features applying recent findings in cognitive science.   AlgoNet2 is the second version of
a computer learning environment that is being developed to explore possible interfaces for cognitive media learning
environments. This version, as its predecessor, AlgoNet, teaches basic concepts in graph theory.
       Figure 1 shows a typical AlgoNet screen.     Domain information is presented in the large window in        the
upper left hand comer of the screen.   To the right of the domain window is the Topic Tree & History window.
This window provides information about the organization of the domain information, the user's current position
within the system, and a graphical trace of pages the user has visited. In the lower left part of the screen are four
cognitive media buttons that provide access to different kinds of cognitive media    In the box on the lower right,
users can select from a list of questions to ask about the current topic.   The bottom edge of the screen contains
buttons for moving back to the last node visited, invoking the help system, and for exiting AlgoNet2.

                                                          Graph Basics

                            A graph Is made up or two elements: VERTICES and EDGES.

                            A VERTEX Is a node In the graph.    This node can represent a condition or a
                            state in some situation. VERTICES can be reached by lra\leling along the
                          . EDGES between nodes.     Hence, VERTICES can be thought of as the 'stopping
                            points· In the graph.

                            An EDGE is simply a line or path that connects two VERTICES.  One EDGE
                          . can only connect two VERTICES.     However, a single VERTEX may have many
                          , different EDGES connected   to it.

                                                        Figure 1: A Typical AlgoNet2 Screen.

      Just as in AlgoNet, information presented in AlgoNet2 is divided into groups of pages.                                                                                     Each of these
groups (or nodes) covers exactly one topic. Each page within a node belongs to one of four cognitive media types:
definitions, examples, pseudocode, and animations (dynamic visualizations).

      To allow access           to pages           within       the current     node,     we        provide   graphical buttons                                   for     the   cognitive media
types (Figure 1, lower left comer).                     The     small  images           simplify         the mental association                                   between       the button  and
content or type of domain information                    "behind" it.          The current active view is highlighted.                                                   Buttons corresponding
to cognitive media types unavailable in the current node are "ghosted" and drawn in light gray.                                                                               The four graphical

 buttons remain on the screen at all times, unlike AlgoNet's buttons which were simple text boxes that changed from
 node to node.
         AlgoNet2 allows for two different types of navigation between topics (nodes).                                                    One of these navigation
 styles was based on the idea that it would be very natural and familiar for a student to ask questions about the
 current topic.  To avoid   the rigors  of natural language  understanding,                                               we  instead   presented a box   with  pre
 formulated questions for each topic (Figure l , lower right).  When     the                                            user clicks on  a question, a  related topic
 containing the answer to this question is shown. The "back" button allows users to return to the previously visited
 node. It was   hoped that the question-based   format would encourage   students                                             to ask  questions of both their  peers
 and instructors as well as themselves. This question asking/answering behavior has been linked to learning goals
 [Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reinmann & Glasser 1988; Chi & VanLehn 1991; Ng & Bereiter 1991; Ram 1991; Ram &
 Leake 1995; VanLehn & Chi 1992].       We intentionally   omitted   a "next page" function (contained in                                              the original
 AlgoNet) that allows users to proceed through the system in some pre-formulated, linear fashion.                                                 By removing   this
 feature we forced the users to choose their own paths through the system, hoping to encouraging active learning and
 reflection on learning goals and strategies.
        Another   new feature   in  AlgoNet2   was the  Topic   Tree &   History                                             window.      This window   provides  a
 hierarchical, "bird's eye" view ofthe information in AlgoNet2.  Each node is an instance or                                               type of its parent, e.g.,
 cycles and paths are two types ofgraph basics.    We anticipated that adding this structure to the domain                                             information
 would encourage students to incorporate a similar structure in their own mental models, facilitating the retention of
 the material.

                              User generated jumps are represented as dotted lines.
        In addition to the question-asking interface, a student can also move directly to any node by clicking the
appropriate node on the topic tree.  As the student navigates, the topic tree provides feedback,                                               relating which nodes
have been most recently visited as well as which nodes have yet to be visited.                                                   This additional information was
intended to    prevent the user from becoming     lost in a  tangle  of pages                                              and   links, a common    problem    with
hypermedia-based systems. The topic tree color codes the nodes. The current node is highlighted with a light red
background.    All previously visited nodes have a light blue background.                                                Unvisited nodes are rendered light    gray.
A history ofthe last seven steps is provided by color-coding the links between nodes drawn using a "hot to cold"
metaphor. The most recently used link is indicated by a bright red arrow, the next                                               six  most recently used links  are
colored various shades from orange to blue, blue being the least recently used link.                                                  Links used more than seven
steps ago, or not at all, are represented as thin, black lines.  In  the topic                                            tree, we  distinguish   between "regular"
moves within the topic tree (solid lines) and random jumps to other parts of the system (dashed lines) (Figure 3).
This color-coded path through the topic tree is provided in order to give context to the current node, helping to
answer questions such as "Why did I come to this node in the first place?"                                                "What information was I looking for?"
and "What do I do with it when I have found it?"

Evaluation
          The AlgoNet2 system was evaluated in anticipation of fielding the system as a routine component of the
introductory level computer science curriculum at Georgia Tech.        Participants in the empirical studies were 148
students enrolled in a first-year introductory computer science course. The AlgoNet2 study was designed to take the
place ofone ofthe regular laboratory sessions in this course.
          One goal of the empirical study was to determine the extent to which students could use the system as a
stand-alone module for self-directed learning.  As    such, the subject material included   in the   AlgoNet2  system   was
not covered in classroom lectures. In addition, no formal instructions were given to the participants on the use of
the system itself.
          The laboratory  sessions  in this  course are not   normally    designed  to provide   students  with   hands-on
experience in computer problem-solving.      In order to evaluate the system in as natural a setting as possible,       the
empirical studies were conducted    within  the context of a routine laboratory assignment and       were  directed  by the
students' normal   laboratory instructors  and teaching   assistants.  Our  lab    assignment  asked  students to   solve a
problem involving graph theory imbedded in a situation from the popular computer game Doom.                  By   applying
graph theory to a graph representing a part ofone level ofthe game, students were able to ''win" the game and solve
the lab.
         The  students were given   a lab assignment and    were told  only   that AlgoNet2    would   be of assistance   in
completing the assignment.    In order  to   successfully complete    the lab assignment,   students   needed  to learn an
appropriate graph  algorithm  and   underlying concepts,    (one of two   "minimum     spanning   tree" algorithms)   from
among those presented in the system and then execute the algorithm.           No   attempt was made    to explicitly direct
students to specific graph concepts or definitions.
         After completing the lab assignment, the students were directed to exit AlgoNet2 and complete a post-lab
questionnaire.   The questionnaire  elicited   personal information    from   each  student  ( e.g., about their  previous
computer  experience) and  asked   some   general system    evaluation questions.    The questionnaire also included a
section that contained questions designed to test the students' understanding of some basic graph concepts.
         In addition to the lab assignment and the post-lab questionnaire, there were two other sources of data.        The
AlgoNet2 system automatically logged each participant's interactions with the system.            We  also videotaped  four
volunteers to help identify any system usage difficulties or other activities ofinterest.

          Table 1:   Students used the topic tree far more often than the question-asking interface.
         Recall that students had three different ways of navigating through the AlgoNet2.        Table 4 recounts these
methods and the rationale behind each one. The right hand column shows the average number oftimes each student
used each type ofnavigation.  Users used the topic tree far more than the     question-asking interface   even though   the
two provide essential the same functionality: the ability to move between different nodes in the system.
         Overall,  users showed   a slight   preference for    examples    and   visualizations  over   pseudocodes     and
definitions. However there was no significant correlation between users' experience levels and their preference for
one cognitive media type over another.      Over two-thirds (68%) of the students responding said that they were
satisfied with the AlgoNet2 system in the post-lab survey.
         Students tended to view visualizations far longer than any other form of cognitive media type as measured
by the amount of time spent with each media type (Figure 4).     This tendency to dwell on     visualizations was echoed
in the original AlgoNet study [Recker et al. 1995].
         Analysis  of the numerical    data  produced  several meaningful     and  statistically significant  correlations.
Students' time viewing the visualization was positively correlated with their performance on the lab assignment, (r
= .290,p < .01).  SAT-verbal scores were negatively correlated with time viewing the mostly textual        definition   and

                                                                                                                     499
example pages, (r = .335, p < .01).    SAT-verbal scores were also negatively correlated with use of the question
asking interface (r = -.211, p < .05). Number of uses of the topic tree interface was negatively correlated with the
students' self-report of the difficulty of the lab (r = .192, p < .1).  Post-lab quiz scores correlated positively with
students' viewing times for definitions and examples (r = .323 and .215 respectively, both at p < .05).
         Some correlations were conspicuously absent         Previous background, including major field, SAT scores,
and previous computer science background had no significant bearing on students' performance on the lab or the
post-lab quiz.

Discussion
         Student reports of the difficulty of the lab were negatively correlated with their usage of the topic tree.
Students using the topic tree more often found the lab to be easier overall. While this result is purely correlational,
we are hopeful that we can demonstrate that our experimental interface does in fact increase ease-of-use.
         The question-asking interface and the topic tree both provide the same function: the ability to move from
one node to the next.  However, the students  used      the topic tree far more than the question-asking                                                        interface.    One
reason for this difference might be that the topic tree allowed instant access to any node in the entire system while
the question-asking interface only allows one-hop moves along the topic tree.      The students' preference                                                        for the topic
tree may be pure convenience.  Alternately, the larger, more graphical topic tree may draw the students' attention.
Finally, the topic tree may actually be a more comprehensible interface.        Additional research is needed to explore
these possibilities.
         The negative correlation between SAT-verbal scores and        time     viewing  definitions                                                        (which tend    to  be
composed of plain-English definitions of concepts) can be explained in the following way: highly verbal students
viewed the sanie number of definitions and examples, but needed less time to absorb the same amount of content as
less-verbal students. This suggests that students with different abilities use cognitive media types differently.
         One ofthe clearest messages in the log data is that "glitzy" multimedia, i.e., fancy animations, is not an
atheoretical luxury.  Multimedia is capable of capturing and holding the subject's attention                                                           far better than any other
media type we studied.   There was only one visualization in the entire system, but users spent far                                                          more time     at this
page than of any other category of page.    This finding is confirmed by the post-lab questionnaire as well.                                                               When
asked what the system lacked, students often requested more multimedia support.           Students'                                                         suggestions    ranged
from, "More animations for algorithms," to "Add kewl (sic) sounds."
         When queried on their learning strategies, very few students could give a clear answer, if any at all.                                                            Of the
students responding   to the question, the   most  common         strategies cited were  ''wander                                                         randomly,"   and "read
everything." Students also reported :frustration with this type of instruction, citing a lack                                                          of "direction"  and ''what
to do next information." This clearly demonstrates that our question-asking protocol was not enough to encourage
students to effectively guide their own thinking process and suggests that there is a need for the effective teaching of
learning strategies.
         While students were unable to identify their learning strategies, experimenters circulating through the labs
did notice a consistent learning strategy. Many students tended to scan all of the    content information quickly,                                                            then
begin solving the lab.   As they worked on their lab, students often returned to the AlgoNet2 system, suggesting

that they were actively hunting for information they needed.  This suggests that students do use learning strategies,
but may not be aware of them.

Future Work
           Our pilot study of AlgoNet2 produced large amounts of data.      Our  next  step will be to continue  the
analysis of the data and report any additional trends discovered. When all the data have been analyzed, we will
begin work on AlgoNet3, a third version of the AlgoNet system which will include more cognitive media types
such as problem sets and worked problems as well as more multimedia and interactive components.            The next
system will also be applied to domains outside ofgraph theory.
           Future versions of AlgoNet can be useful in three distinct ways. First, they can be deployed in actual
classrooms as instructional tools. Second, we can continue to study students' interaction with the  systems in  order
to refine the learning environments and develop design guidelines as we have done in this    paper.  Finally, future
systems    can help us explore the learning itself, revealing students' strategies and understandings  of their own
learning processes.
