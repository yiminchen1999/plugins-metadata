              Abstract:    The aim of this study was to examine conceptual change from a knowledge-building
              perspective.    Knowledge-building is a process by which learners collaboratively improve their
              understanding by recording their current ideas as knowledge objects in a communal database.
              These   ideas   are  then  available   for discussion   and  continual     improvement.      The    target
              environment for our investigations was the CSILE (Computer-Supported Intentional Learning
              Environments)      networked  environment    in  which     students  report   their thoughts   as text  or
              graphic notes, then collaboratively work to construct.higher levels of understanding.             A fifth
              and sixth-grade combined classroom participated in this study by constructing a database on
              the topic of how heat affects matter.        Based     on- computer-tracking    files, students'  written
              dis<;:ourses were   evaluated  by   two   independent   criteria:    (1)   conceptual  change,    and   (2)
              . knowle"dge-building activities.  The results suggested that students who maintained knowledge
              building  goals    and · evaluated  their  ideas in the  context    of  the writings   of  the   scientific
              community beyond their classroom succeeded in attaining critical conceptual change.

1. Background and Problems
          Recent   studies    of conceptual     change    [e.g.,  Vosniadou     1994]     suggest    that students'    belief system
acquired  through   everyday      experiences     prevents them      from  integrating      new   scientific   principles   into  their
existing knowledge.     [Chi, Slotta, & de Leeuw 1994b; Slotta, Chi, & Joram 1995] have shown that conceptual
change  phenomena      can    be divided  into    two   types:   (1) difficult  conceptual    change      that  requires   students to
reject their  current  belief    system,  and    (2)  relatively  easy   conceptual      change    that   can  be  attained   through
accumulation of new scientific knowledge.            To explain the difference in difficulties of conceptual change, Chi
et al. proposed an ontological perspective on scientific concepts.              They assume that a concept belongs to one
or more of three ontological trees in our knowledge structure:              material, process, and mental state.            Difficulty
of conceptual   change     happens    if an ontological    tree   in which    students    place   a  concept    is  different from   a
scientifically correct ontological tree (e.g., heat as material vs. heat as process).
          Although    studies    have   provided     us  with  the   theoretical     mechanisms      of   conceptual      change  and
methods   to  evaluate  students'   knowledge     [e.g., Slotta   et al. 1995],   we   need  to   clarify how    conceptual   change
happens   in  classroom       learning.   Studies    in  cognitive    science     suggest    the   following:      Self-explanation
facilitates students' reflection on their knowledge and new principles, allowing them to integrate more m ature
scientific concepts with their existing ideas [e.g., Chi, de Leeuw, Chiu, & Lavancher I 994a].                        Further, studies
suggest   the importance      of a  learning environment       where     students    engage   in  knowledge-building        activities
through   distribution  of    their expertise     [e.g., Brown     &   Campione        1994;  Scardamalia       &   Bereiter  1 993].
Knowledge-building         is a   process   by    which   learners    collaboratively       improve      their  understanding       by
manipulating    their  existing    knowledge      and    new   information     through      progressive   discourse       [Bereiter &
Scardamalia    1993].      From     this  perspective,     misconceptions         are  resources     for  improving       conceptual
understanding [Smith, diSessa, & Roschelle 1993].              The issue is how to create an explanatory-discourse-based
community in the classroom.
          In  this paper,     we  examined      a knowledge-building        classroom       community      supported      by  C S ILE
(Computer-Supported        Intentional   Learning     Environments).      CSILE       is  a networked     computer     environment
designed  to  support   knowledge       building.    In  CSILE,    students    write   text  or   graphic  notes    to convey     their
theories. These    notes   reside  in a  communal       database  where   other participants have access           to them,   and can
work collaboratively     to   compare    theories,   find counterexamples,        record    new   information      bearing  on   these
theories, provide   constructive    commentary,       and generally      work   to construct      higher  levels   of understanding
[Scardamalia & Bereiter 1993; Scardamalia, Bereiter, & Lamon 1994].                       The system supports students' active
engagement with theories by providing:            (I) note types that encourage theory formulation and analysis and

256
sustained   inquiry   regarding  problems  of  understanding,      and (2) database  search mechanisms       that support
students  in the   creation  of a  collaborative community      in which   they read  each  others'   notes  and  work   to
advance the ideas contained in them.
         We analyzed students' written CSILE discourse along two dimensions:            (1) conceptual change and (2)
knowledge-building.      Based  on the  conceptual  change   in students'  written  discourse, we  categorized    students
into high- or low-conceptual-change learners, then compared knowledge-building activities between the high
and low-change groups.

2.   Study Description
2.1  Participants
         Thirty students (21 males and 9 females) in a combined fifth- and sixth-grade classroom in a Toronto
public school participated in this study.    The school has an ethnically diverse, largely middle-class population.
2.2  Study Topic
            The  unit studied   was   a curriculum     unit on  heat  and   matter.    Students conducted       classroom
experiments before they started CSILE sessions.        During the seven-week CSILE sessions, they recorded their
theories about how heat affects matter and worked to provide explanations of the phenomena they viewed as
part of the following experiments:      (1) thermal expansion by using a ring and a ball, (2) heat conduction in
different objects, '(3) heating bimetallic strips to see them bend, (4) heating different types of liquids, and (5)
heating or cooling air captured in a container to see how the air affects water levels in another container.
2.3  How CSILE Sessions Worked
         During CSILE sessions, students collaboratively engage· in explanatory discourse on a shared problem.
Students used discussion notes which require that they identify a problem of understanding and then enter the
following   not   types: My   Theory (MT),   I Need To Understand (INTU),       New    Information    (NI), and Comment
(C). · Stuents    could  then  search the· database by    these entry types  or by  a  variety of  other    attributes that
CSILE recpids automatically (e.g., author) or that students assign to notes when they store them (e.g., topic or
keywords).    If they wanted to discuss a new problem that emerged in the course of pursuing the main shared
problem, they created a sub-branch of the discussion note, and a subset of students pursued this line of inquiry
while others continued with the central problem that they had identified.            Students also generated graphic
notes and created links between notes so that they could trace dialogical processes across different discussion
notes, comment notes, and graphic notes [see Appendix A for an example of a CSILE-based knowledge
building episode].
         The teacher had students focus on three main discussion notes, each of which dealt with a different
form of matter, i.e., "How heat affects solids," "How heat affects liquids," and "How heat affects gases."
2.4  Study Design
        Students    were  first divided  into  high-conceptual-change      (HCC)   and low-conceptual-change      (LCC)
learners based on an analysis of conceptual change represented in the notes they wrote over the course of this
investigation.   Students' knowledge-building activities were then analyzed, with emphasis on the comparison
of high- and low-conceptual-change.
2.5  Assessment of Conceptual Change
        Conceptual change in students' written discourse in CSILE notes was evaluated based on Chi et al.'s
category    test  [1994b; Slotta et al. 1995].   The category test is a new method to assess which ontological
tree(s) students attribute concepts to by classifying predicates the students used in their explanations.              Two
independent raters (inter-rater agreement = .93) classified concepts used in students' explanatory discourse as
(1)  material-based   (e.g.,  heat as   substance having     volume),  (2)   process-based     (e.g., heat   as dynamic
movement of molecules in objects), and/or (3) mental-state-based (e.g., molecules as substance trying to avoid
heat).
        On the basis of the category test of concepts used by students, two different types of learners were
identified. As we described in the procedure, students were engaged in their knowledge-building with the three
main problems such as:       (1) how heat affects solids, (2) how heat affects liquids, and (3) how heat affects
gases.  Students who attained a process-based conceptual understanding of heat in at least two of the three
problems were classified as HCC learners, whereas the remaining ones were classified as LCC learners.                  The
notes that were used to make this judgment were eliminated from subsequent analyses so that the activities
surrounding conceptual advances could be analyzed independently of the conceptual advance itself.
2.6  Evaluation of Knowledge-Building Activities
        Knowledge-building is a process by which learners collaboratively use their current understanding as a
knowledge object -- a written account of their ideas that they can return to in an effort to construct a higher
level of understanding.     In  CSILE,  such  activity is reflected in how   students  report  their  theories, add    new
information, state what they need to understand, and help to improve each other's knowledge objects.                Each

                                                                                                                    257
note is labeled by its "thinking type" (my theory, new information,              I need to understand, and comment).        Two
independent raters evaluated the students' knowledge-building activities by analyzing the following aspects of
students' notes.
2.6.1. Pedagogical orientation (inter-rater agreement= .95)
           We   categorized  each   entry     as either    task-oriented     or knowledge-building       oriented [Bereiter    &
Scardamalia 1993].      A   task-oriented      goal    means   that   students  are completing    assigned    tasks  or directly
reporting results of experiments (e.g., reporting melting points of different objects as determined in the course
of   their experimental    investigation).    A  knowledge-building           goal is  indicated  when    students interpret   or
analyze ideas, using new information to rework or advance an idea (e.g., a student reasons "Heat is formed by
atoms moving, so there for kinetic energy and heat are directly related").                 [Ng & Bereiter 1991] found that
learners with knowledge-building goals demonstrate superior learning.
2.6.2.  Subject-matter     level (inter-rater  agreement=         .90)
           This  aspect involves   the  level    of    scientific information   students   aimed  to    understand.   Based on
graded curriculum guidelines that specify concepts students are expected to comprehend at different grade
levels, we categorized the level of statements in their entries into:              (1) lower than expected grade level, (2)
expected grade level, or (3) higher than expected grade level.
2.6.3.  Context of knowledge advancement (inter-rater agreement = .86)
           Recent educational studies suggest that students develop their understanding most effectively through
distributed knowledge processes in the classroom, as opposed to working alone or having all students engaged
in the same activity,   with   no  effort to  share    findings   or to help  one  another [e.g., Brown    &  Campione      1994;
Scardamalia,     Bereiter,  &    Lamon    1994].       We    evaluated    what   context  students   tried   to  work   in, then
categorized   each   entry  according     to:  (1)     subjective    knowledge    advancement     and   objective   knowledge
advancement.      The   distinction between      subjective   and    objective  knowledge    is  from   Popper's  notion   of  the
difference   between    knowledge   in    World      2 and   World   3  [Bereiter, 1994;   Scardamalia,    Bereiter, &   Lamon
1994].  According to [Popper 1972], knowledge in World 2 represents knowledge as represented in each human
mind.   If people are primarily working on improving their own understanding of matters, they are advancing
their World 2 knowledge.          Researchers     and   scientists   are  more  likely to  treat  their ideas as  objects   to be
shared  among    people  in their  community,       with  the goal   of   improving knowledge     itself, as well as  their   own
understanding.     Scientific communities tend to serve as models for treating ideas as World 3 objects.                      We
categorized   students'    written discourse     in    each  entry,  determining    whether  they   presented    their  ideas  as
concepts or principles to be reviewed and debated by others in the classroom or whether they presented them
as personal opinion.
2. 7 Measures for the Analysis
           Besides  frequencies   and  proportions      of   note entries  with  different thinking-types,    we  analyzed     the
students' scores of the Canadian Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS) conducted at the beginning of the academic
year.   Our goal was to explore difference between groups of learners that might be related to the basic skills
tapped by these tests.

3.   Results
3.1  Differences in Quality of Initial Theories
           Students' initial explanations of how heat affects matters varied considerably when viewed from the
perspective   of  the conceptual    category     test.  Sixteen    of  the 30   students had  explanations    at the molecular
level, but   no  one  showed     evidence  of    understanding       heat as  process.   Through     application  of   the  same
category    test to their  later   explanations,       eight students     were  identified as    HCC    learners  who   attained
explanations of heat as process in at least two sub-domains.               Six of them had their initial explanations at the
molecular level.    However, there was not a significant difference in proportions in 2 (Conceptual Change)                   X2
(Initial Theories) table, x2(1, N = 30) = 2.06, p = .15.
3.2   Differences in Basic Skills
           Three students (one HCC and two LCCs) were absent when the CTBS was conducted.                           A one-way
MANOVA        on  CTBS     scores   (combined     vocabulary,        reading,  and  spelling score)     showed   no  significant
differences, Wilks' Lambda (3, 33) = .85, p = .29.            Therefore, we concluded that there were no differences in
basic  skills related   to the   usage of  CSILE       between    High-Conceptual-Change        and Low-Conceptual-Change
learners in this study.
3.3  Differences in Knowledge-Building Activities
3.3.1.  Entry frequencies
           We analyzed frequencies of note entries with different thinking-types.             A 2 (Conceptual Change) X 4
(Thinking Types) ANOVA showed two significant main effects, F(l, 28) = 4.95 for Conceptual Change, and
F(3, 84) = 23.8 for Thinking Types, both ps < .05, and an almost significant interaction effect, F(3, 84) = 1.45,

258
p < .07.  Two main effects showed:       (1) that HCC learners were more likely to produce note entries than LCC
learners, and (2) that both groups of learners were more likely to produce MT (My Theory) entries than the
three other types of entries.  Post-hoc comparisons[!]    for the interaction effect revealed that HCC learners were
more   likely to  produce  MT  (My   Theory)   entries than  LCC  learners                [Table 1].  Because of the significant
differences   in  entry frequencies, we  conducted   analyses of students'               knowledge-building   activities    based on
proportions of different categories in each scale.

were more directed to knowledge-building goals in "My Theory" and "In Need To Understand" entries than in
"New Information" and "Comments" entries.       The analysis of proportions of entries with task goals showed two
significant main effects, F(l, 26) = 16.36 for Conceptual Change, and F(3, 78) = 3.30 for Thinking Types, both

3.3.4.  Context of knowledge advancement
         The   analysis of    proportions  of entries   identified as  objective    knowledge    advancement   showed    a
significant effect of Conceptual Change, F(l, 26) = 9.63, p < .05 [Figure 5].              The results revealed that HCC
learners showed significantly higher proportions of entries identified as objective knowledge advancement than
LCC learners.   The analysis of proportions of entries identified as subjective knowledge advancement showed
two significant main effects, F(l, 26) = 12.18 for Conceptual Change and F(2, 52) = 4.38 for Thinking Types,
both ps < .05 [Figure 6].     Post-hoc comparisons revealed:       (1) that LCC learners conveyed significantly more
subjective knowledge advancement across three different thinking types than HCC learners, and (2) that both
groups of learners reported significantly more subjective knowledge advancement in "My Theory" entries than
in other entry types.
4.   Discussion
         As might be predicted from research on mental models, more HCC learners started with a molecular
level of explanation than did LCC learners (although differences were not found to be significant).              Because
HCC learners had more appropriate mental models to understand scientifically correct conception of heat, they
were   more  likely to  attain  critical conceptual   change.     The comparison      of frequencies  showed   that HCC
learners generated more entries with "My Theory" thinking type than did the other two groups.                 This result
suggests that learners' engagement with the system was related to their success in conceptual change.               When
the  students  were given     and  made   use of  new   media   to externalize   their   knowledge,   particularly  in the
problem-based   way    (i.e., "My  Theory"    entries), their quality  of  learning   improved.   One   of  reasons HCC
learners were more likely to generate entries may be that they had more appropriate mental models, thus
allowing them to more readily write about their ideas, and subsequently search and integrate new information.
Thus, initial level of knowledge might affect their knowledge-building activities.
         The  comparisons     of  proportions  in the   three aspects   of  knowledge-building    activities  suggest  the
following:   HCC learners consistently set knowledge-building as opposed to task goals for themselves.              Three
activities were found to be critical to success in conceptual change:         HCC learners attempted to improve their
theories through  integration   of scientific ideas   they found   in the  course   of their research , using books    that
brought them into contact with ideas beyond those found in the database.            Further, they were more inclined to
challenge   new   problems    (INTUs)    with knowledge-building       goals.    Finally,   they were   also  directed  to
knowledge-building     goals  in  improving   others' knowledge.      Thus,   progressive   problem-solving   [Bereiter &
Scardamalia 1993] often appeared in HCC learners.
         Another noticeable finding in the pedagogical analysis of students' knowledge-building activities was
that both groups of learners were significantly more directed to knowledge-building goals in "My Theory" and
"I Need To Understand" entries than in "New Information" and "Comments" entries.                In the "New Information"
entries, they were more likely to copy information from reference sources, and comments were more likely to
focus on task goals than on kriowledge-building goals.
         The  subject-matter    expertise  analysis,  as   we  expected,   showed     that  HCC  learners  reported their
theories and information at higher levels of expertise than did LCC learners.            An interesting finding here was
that both  groups   of learners,  even   though  engaged   in  different  levels of   subject-matter  expertise, reported
significantly higher levels of information in their theory entries. It is not clear from the analysis in this study:
(1) if students had difficulty integrating "New Information" into their theories or (2) if they used the "New
Information" entries to record information not directly related to their theories.           We are currently analyzing
"New Information" entries to explore these different possibilities.

5. Educational Implications
         Within a knowledge-building framework naive conceptions can be an asset, but only if naive ideas are
brought out in the open, as the objects of discussion.         For this to succeed, teachers must create classroom
cultures  in  which   students   feel free to  discuss   naive    conceptions.    The    CSILE   environment     helps  by
encouraging students to write about their current understandings, and to use these as stepping stones for more
mature understandings.
         Making   current  understandings   the  objects   of discussion   is a first  step in knowledge-building.     The
present study provided us with an account of knowledge-building activities that facilitate conceptual change
beyond this point.  High-conceptual-change students set knowledge-building goals for themselves -- goals that
engage   them  in efforts  to  understand   ideas  beyond     the tasks  as   presented  by  teachers   or by the  school
curriculum.   They do not simply interpret the results of tests, they actively work to determine how those results
fit with their  current  explanations.     They   additionally    juxtapose   their ideas   with more   mature   ideas  as
represented in the scientific literature they read, and in this way extend their ideas beyond the ideas discussed
by the immediate community.

                                                                                                                    261
          Thus, intentional reflective activities should be emphasized for the purpose of increasing efficiency of
learning.    [Chi et al. 1994a] discuss three characteristics of information-processing in self-explanations:              (1)
 constructive,  (2)  facilitating  integration   of  self knowledge     with new  information,    and (3)     having  learners
engage in continuous revision of ideas.         In the student-CSILE interaction, these three characteristics are also
emphasized and extended to asynchronous communication and collaborative learning.                  As Chi et al. point out,
 intentional   reflective   activities such   as   self-explanations    manifest maximum      effects     when  learners   are
 continuously (i.e., minute-by-minute) engaged in such constructive activities.         When learners do not have ways
 to integrate knowledge fraagments, educationally preferable results cannot be expected.             The computer-support
 for asynchronous       communication     provided   by   CSILE  allows   students   to engage    in distributed    cognitive
 processes   over   lengthy  periods   of time  and  across  diverse    communities  [Oshima,     Bereiter,   & Scardamalia
 1995].   The   results  in  this  study  suggest    that CSILE     has educational  effects  for   students   to  engag e in
continuous and progressive problem solving in their curriculum.
           Six  of  the   eight   students   in the  high-conceptual    change   category  started   their    inquiry with  a
 molecular explanation of how heat affects matter.         The molecular account represented a more mature account
 than demonstrated by the remaining students.          It is important to note, however, that two HCC students did not
have this advantage, yet shifted within the same time span to the more sophisticated process account evidence
 by  all HCC    students.      Data   suggest   that the   HCC  students     without molecular     levels   of  explanations
accomplished this through execution of the same knowledge-building strategies as the HCC students who
started the activity with more mature mental models.          While the design of the present study does not allow us
to determine if knowledge-building activities are more facilitative than other classroom activities might be,
the  progress  students     made  in  seven  weeks   was   substantial.   In the aggregate,   the  fifth  and   sixth graders
involved in this study set goals for understanding beyond that typical of their grade level and made substantial
 progress toward achieving those goals.
