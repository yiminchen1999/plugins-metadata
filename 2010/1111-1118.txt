         Abstract: In this case study, we compare activities experienced by one 5-year old child in her
         home   and her preschool in terms of how they         afford scientific exploration  and inquiry.      We
         focus specifically on two types of interactional configuration: the first is an adult-guided mode
         of interaction    in which   a  parent    closely  monitors    the child's attention   and    action and
         accordingly orchestrates the emergence of opportunities for scientific observation, exploration
         and knowledge      construction;   the  other  is   a type of   peer play  that  occurs    frequently  at
         preschool,  in which    children   collaboratively    explore  the  physical  properties   of  the world
         around   them.    Through    close     microanalysis    we  compare    these    activities  as  learning
         arrangements   (Stevens,     Satwicz   &  McCarthy,     2008),  considering   how   they   allow   for or
         constrain children's entry into scientific activities, as well as the particular opportunities for
         learning they may afford.

Introduction
In this paper, we compare aspects of the home and preschool contexts in terms of how they afford particular
types of scientific  exploration     and inquiry   in early   childhood.    Rather  than  surveying    the  entire range of
activities in which children may engage in each of these environments, we focus on two types of interactional
configuration which map onto these contexts--by this we mean not just that we have found them occurring in
one of these settings, but rather that there are particular aspects of the environments that make them more likely
to occur in  one  than  the   other. The  first is an adult-guided   mode    of interaction  in which    the  adult  closely
monitors the  child's  attention  and    action  and  accordingly   orchestrates   the emergence     of  opportunities   for
scientific observation, exploration and knowledge construction.          Like others (e.g., Goodwin, 2007; Crowley &
Jacobs, 2002), we have observed this occurring in family interactions.        The other configuration is a type of peer
interaction that occurs frequently within "free-play" periods at        preschool.  Often in the service of other goals,
which may be fluid and loosely defined, children collaboratively explore the physical properties of the world
around them--making      observations,    developing    hypotheses,     and even   conducting   informal    experiments  in
short-lived social groupings of varying sizes.      In both contexts, the type of science learning we focus on in this
paper might be termed emergent or serendipitous (e.g., Stevens, 2000; Bell, et al., 2009) in that it occurs in the
process of everyday living and playing with others, rather than within events that are explicitly designed for
science learning.
         In the  pages  that  follow  we   analyze    several  interactions engaged    in by  one   5-year-old  girl in  our
study. These include home interactions in which the child and her parents discuss the plants growing in their
garden and the child's techniques for watering them, as well as preschool-based peer interactions such as one in
which the child and her peers use a tape-measure to calculate the length of various objects in their classroom
and then discover how to use it as a projectile. Through close microanalysis we compare these activities as
learning arrangements (Stevens, Satwicz & McCarthy, 2008), considering how they allow for or constrain
children's entry into scientific activities, as well as the particular opportunities for learning they may afford.
Background
This  study responds    to previous   calls for    research  investigating   learning  across school    and   out-of-school
experiences (Stevens et al, 2005). While much educational research has focused on children's school experience
at the expense of what happens in the home, research on informal science learning in early childhood has
focused primarily on the family. Such research has shown that children have opportunities to learn scientific
concepts in everyday life, and that adults in their lives have practices for supporting them in this process (e.g.,
Tizard & Hughes,   1984; Callanan & Oakes, 1992).        Other researchers have pointed to the value of learning from
peers in early childhood (Rogoff, 1990; Williams, 2001). Our observations suggest that informal play activities
create a rich interactional environment for such peer learning. Interestingly, a primary site for such informal
peer interactions seems to be the quasi-formal context of the preschool.
         While educational research on school-age children may tend to focus on the classroom more than the
home,  research   on learning   and   development     in   early  childhood   has  tended  to focus    on   the home,   and
particularly the dyadic interactions between parents and children that occur there. This tendency may be partly
due to dominant cultural notions about child-rearing in the American middle class, but has been compounded
through the research methods usually employed to study interaction and development in early childhood (Ochs

& Schieffelin, 1984). Our ethnographic approach, on the other hand, allows us to examine both home and
preschool settings in their own right to identify and examine the ways in which learning is occurring, which can
then be compared with the other contexts of children's lives.

Study Description
This paper reports on one piece of a larger study examining young children's learning (2-5 years old) as it
occurs in the multiple environments of their everyday lives, environments which may differ markedly in the
opportunities   for   participation  and     resources for     learning      they    offer. By  observing   and    recording  young
children's interactions in multiple contexts (such as preschool, home, and playgroups) and among different
configurations of co-interactants (including peers, older and younger children, teachers and caregivers), we seek
to capture the complexity and variety of the social environments in and through which young children learn.
         The    first phase     of this  study   involved       weekly        video-recording    in    a childcare    classroom  for
approximately five months.       In addition, two of the children in the classroom were also observed and recorded
in their home environments.        All in all, approximately 98 hours of video were collected, digitized and logged.
In a second phase of this study, we are video-recording in four rooms at two preschools for a total of nine
months.  In addition, out-of-school activities of eight children are being recorded.
         In this paper we report on the first phase of the study, in which we observed and recorded activities in
"Rocket Room," a kindergarten-readiness classroom (4-5 years old) in a nonprofit NAEYC-accredited childcare
center. The center was located in a middle class neighborhood of a mid-sized Western city. There were 20
children in the Rocket  Room,      supervised  by a lead teacher and          an assistant teacher.    Our observations took   place
in the mornings, during which time the children participated in free-play, breakfast, art activities, and circle
time. We describe learning interactions experienced by Darcy, one of the focal children in the study, both in the
preschool and her home environment. Darcy was 5 years old at the time of the study and had an 18-month old
sister. Both Darcy and her sister attended the childcare center full time.                  Darcy's parents both worked in high-
tech occupations.
         We employ the method of video-based microanalysis of interaction (Stevens & Hall, 1998; see also
Jordan   &  Henderson,     1995;    Streeck    &  Mehus,        2005).      Our      moment-by-moment      analysis    allows us  to
demonstrate   possibilities    for learning   and requirements            for   interaction  in the    activities in which children
participate. This form of qualitative inquiry allows us to cautiously generalize our findings not to populations
but rather to practices and activities based on principles derived from analyzing structures of social action.

Analysis
Parent-Guided Learning Interactions at Home
When video-recording children in home environments, we frequently captured interactions that were intensely
mediated by parents.    In the section that follows, we describe some such interactions that arguably could have
relevance   for the   development    of scientific skills      and       interest,   and analyze the   particular  opportunities for
learning they afford.
Key Characteristics of the Learning Arrangement
What do we mean by "parent-guided learning interactions"?                    These are events that may be planned in advance,
but even if not they are organized for children's learning as they proceed. Within these activities, children's talk
and actions are closely monitored by adults and frequently commented upon, usually praised. Children's actions
and other aspects of the environment are frequently used as a starting point for elaboration and exploration,
within which    there  are clear   (and  often   explicit)     attempts      to guide    children's    perception  toward particular
aspects of the scene and to provide labels for what children are experiencing (Stevens & Hall, 1998). The
segment below exemplifies several of these features.             This occurs in the back yard of Darcy's home.             Darcy is
splashing in an inflatable swimming pool while her mother and father watch.                     Her mother gets up to take a look
at their garden, and calls Darcy's attention to what she sees.

37   Researcher:     Yeah.

          This segment exemplifies several of the features that characterize adult-child learning interactions in
the homes that we studied. First, these events are managed for children's learning. In some cases, they are pre-
planned, involving the preparation of materials and the use of predesignated roles and actions. Even when they
are not,  the   activities are  organized      by adults    in  the      moment,     with slots for  children's    participation being
provided by the parents. While the particular event above was not planned at the level of a classroom lesson, it
was purposefully brought into being for educational purposes by the parents.                       Darcy's mother told us that they
decided to plant a garden (their first) specifically for Darcy's benefit (as a means to "inspire little Darcy about
growing   things,"   as well   as    potentially  get    her more          interested in eating vegetables).      Within  the moment,
Darcy's   mother    enlists   her participation       in a  familiar       interactional  routine.  For    examples,   in lines  27-31,
Darcy's mother engages her in a school-like initiation-response sequence in which the mother is asking Darcy
"known-answer" questions (cf. Mehan, 1979; Cazden, 1988).
          Within these events, children's actions and talk are closely monitored, explicitly commented on, often
praised, and elaborated upon.        For instance, in line 12 Darcy's mother verbally calls attention to Darcy's action
and labels   it  as "kinda    clever,"    further describing          it in line  13  as  being "like  rocket-shipping".      Physical
phenomena in the environment are also noted and commented upon, even used as opportunities for "occasioned
knowledge exploration" (Goodwin, 2007). We see this in lines 1-3 above, when Darcy's mother first calls her
attention   to the  garden's   need     for  water,   as   well       as in lines  22-34,  when    she     discovers new  growth    and
subsequently guides Darcy in specifying what they are seeing.                     Parents orient to these as potentially educational
moments (though not usually as explicitly as does Darcy's father in line 36 above).
Opportunities for Learning in Parent-Guided Interactions
There are several types of learning opportunities that children encounter in these types of interaction.                      Many of
them  are   provided    by  parents    through    talk.    For instance,      a   prominent  source    of   potential learning   in the
interaction above comes from the mothers' directing of her daughter's attention and guiding or disciplining of
her perception (e.g.,   Stevens & Hall, 1998).           We see this in     lines 1-2, in which Darcy's mother       not only calls her
attention to a specific aspect of the environment, but guides her in how to see it--i.e., to recognize the dirt as
soil that "looks dry."
          We can also see this in the way Darcy's mother calls attention to Darcy's actions.                       For example, in this
exchange Darcy's mother verbally takes notice of an action being performed by the child and frames this action
as being  both purposeful and        ingenious.  In Line    12 an      explicit positive assessment is     made, linked to the child's
action with the deictic pronoun "that's." This assessment is followed by elaboration of why the child's action
seems like a good idea, in the form of a description of what the child is achieving through her action (line 13).
At that moment Darcy is standing on the edge of the garden bed and rocking the watering can back and forth,
which causes the water to slosh out, reaching further into the bed than it would if she were simply pouring it out.
Darcy's mother's "rocket-ship" analogy conveys the notion that through her action, Darcy is causing something

                                                            1113       ·   © ISLS

to be propelled through the air, "cleverly" solving the problem of how to water the far side of the garden.      This
represents a compelling example of the ways in which adults can frame aspects of the world for children, in this
case quite possibly shaping a child's retrospective understanding of her own action.
          Darcy's mother also engages Darcy's participation in these labeling activities.      For instance, in line 27
Darcy's mother elicits a label from Darcy by asking "What are those?", and then requests specification in line
29 with "what kinda sprouts?".    As Darcy participates in these activities, she potentially learns ways of seeing,
categorizing and labeling the world around her--as well as ways of thinking about and valuing her own actions.
          Finally, it should be noted that Darcy takes advantage of this interactional arrangement to initiate and
further her own learning experiences. Twice she issues declarative statements that draw responses from her
mother.   For instance, in line 7, Darcy asserts that she can smell the sweet peas. Her mother responds with the
question "what do they smell like?" then proposes a candidate answer: "Do they smell sweet?"             In line 33, in
response to her mother's enthusiastic pointing out of the new sprouts, Darcy comments that she (Darcy) has
"done some very good watering." The timing of Darcy's assertion suggests that she is making a connection
between the sprouting of the sunflower seeds and her previous watering actions--an idea that may have been
planted (so to speak) in previous interactions with adults. By making this claim in the context of an interaction
with her mother, Darcy makes it available for confirmation, which her mother provides unambiguously in the
next line.
Discussion: Adult-Child Interaction in the Home as Learning Arrangement
The participation framework of adult-child talk in the home makes for excellent learning opportunities for
children:  parents guide   children's attention, deliver  comments     and  questions that  are  tightly coupled with
children's  activities, and design  and  orchestrate  interactions   with  children's  learning  in mind.  Children's
initiations of learning opportunities are taken up readily and enthusiastically. The interactional demands on
children are low: adults do much work to invite children's participation and ensure that these activities work as
learning arrangements. These do not represent the totality of children's interactions at home; there are times
when the children do not have their parents' full attention. Even when they do, parents are not always able to
take advantage of every learning opportunity. It should also be noted that other types of interaction that occur in
this home (and other homes) may offer different types of learning opportunities (such as guided participation in
adult activity, intent observation of adult or peer activity, peer learning in sibling play, to name only a few). We
focus on this type both because we observed it frequently, and because particular features of the interaction
format make it rich with learning opportunities, as described above.
          We propose that structural and cultural aspects of the home setting make these types of interaction
more likely to occur there than in preschool, most simply the numbers of adults and children. In preschool, the
ratio of children to adults means that teachers must frequently shift attention in order to monitor and care for
everyone. While adults in the home may also have other demands on their attention, they are much more likely
to be able to carry out extended interactions in which they maintain focus on the talk and action of an individual
child.  This does not mean that similar interactions cannot occur in preschool settings, and in fact they do. It
does suggest, however, that the unique features of the preschool environment may give rise to other interaction
patterns, which can in turn be analyzed for the ways in which they allow science learning to occur.
Learning through Peer Interaction in the Preschool Classroom
In this section, by  way    of comparison,   we  analyze    the learning  opportunities inherent  in an   interactional
arrangement that we found in our preschool observations and did not find to occur in home--these are small
group activities, organized and guided by children. Though we do not preclude the possibility that this type of
activity might occur in other contexts, there are certain features of this environment that make it possible.     For
instance, during free-play periods at school, teachers rarely spend long periods of time with a single child or
group of children. This means that while they do set up activities for children and step in to mediate children's
interactions, teachers infrequently engage in the intense moment-to-moment guidance typical of the homes we
observed. Rather than having interaction initiated and maintained for them, children engage one another.
Key Characteristics of the Learning Arrangement
The type of activity analyzed in this section is characterized by (1) including 3 or more children (more children
may come in and out of the activity), (2) being initiated, guided and maintained by the children, rather than by
adults, (3) enduring over a relatively long stretch of time (for example, the measuring activity analyzed in this
paper endured for nearly 45 minutes in total), (4) being organized towards some purpose (although individual
goals may not be   shared by all participants and may shift during the activity).  For  the purposes of this paper, we
analyze one extended activity in which all four characteristics are present, as representative of this type of
interaction format.     Though  the activity we  describe   is  not explicitly undertaken   as a "science"  or "math"
activity, there are opportunities for scientific and mathematical exploration and discovery available within it.

Measuring Tape
The activity we analyze in this section occurs over an extended period of time during which a core group of
three children, joined occasionally by other children in the room, play with a tape measure that one of the
children has brought from home.    It is free-play time in  the preschool     classroom.  One of the children, Anna,  gets
up from a table and shows a drawing to one of the teachers (Nancy).           She then brings it over to her cubbie, puts
it in, and pulls out a tape measure. "I brought this from home:::!" she says enthusiastically to an entering parent.
Anna then brings the tape measure over to Nancy who compliments her on the idea to bring a tape measure
from home and asks her what she wants to measure.          Anna begins to measure a bookshelf. Though Nancy soon
becomes occupied with other children, Anna is able to regain her attention long enough to get some help with
the measuring task she has begun.         Specifically, Nancy provides instruction in reading numbers from the tape
("A three  and   a  seven is thirty-seven.")   and with    the  unit of measurement      ("An  inch  is about  that long,"
gesturing with thumb and forefinger). She also provides a different type of guidance: in the form of a question,
she suggests to Anna ways of linking her current measuring activity with adult professional practices ("Are you
a carpenter? A mathematician? A scientist?"). After this point, the children's measuring activity proceeds with
no significant input from any of the adults in the room.
          Perhaps taking her cue from Nancy's question, Anna then initiates a game with some other children, in
which Anna plays the role of carpenter. That game is short-lived, and when it ends Anna and one of the children
(Mira) begin stretching out the measuring tape and letting it go so it retracts into the case.       They are then joined
by one of the girls who will make up the core group: Susan. Susan suggests that they measure people, and
though Anna initially resists this idea, when we find them again (after a one minute gap in which they are out of
camera range) Susan is measuring Anna's height, while Mira watches.               Susan struggles with the challenge of
holding the tape at the floor with one hand and extending the to Anna's head with the other, and then being able
to see the numbers at the top.
          It is at this point that Darcy (one of our focal children and the third girl forming the core group) joins
them. She approaches the two girls, takes the end of the measuring tape, stretches it to the top of Anna's head,
and holds it there.   This allows the girls to move to the next step of the measuring task, which is to read the
number. Anna and Susan then measure Darcy, and the three then move on to measuring a large cardboard tree.
The three girls continue to work together as a team, measuring objects all over the preschool classroom.
          For most   of this period, they    measure  pre-existing   objects,    such as tables, the refrigerator,  chairs,
bookshelves, the elevated stage, room dividers, and a large block.         During this time, they negotiate a set of roles
and a turn-taking system.    The set of roles evolves and shifts over the course of the activity, however, some core
"jobs" emerge, such as holding (and hooking) the tab end of the tape measure; extending the tape measure case;
looking at, reading, and shouting out the measurements (numbers); and being the one to yell "Let go!"; and
releasing the tape measure case (so that it springs back to the hooked tab end as the tape retracts into the case).
          In the last minutes of the activity, the girls begin to put blocks together to construct a low wall to
measure.   Though it may not be appropriate to attribute an overall purpose to the activity ­ as purposes surely
shift locally and vary between individuals ­ a concern expressed explicitly and manifested in the girls' actions is
to add a block between each measuring without reaching the point where the tape measure will no longer extend
to the end of the block line.  When the block line gets all the way to a low stage on one side of the room, they
discover that when they let the tape case go it will slide along the top of the block line and then jump up onto
the stage. This effect is greeted with celebratory whoops and jumps and          repeated  several times.
          There is then an interruption of the dominant activity while the girls join some of their classmates in a
different activity with one of the teachers.     When the girls leave the line of blocks, other children immediately
approach it and begin to appropriate the blocks for their own purposes. The girls enlist the help of a teacher
(Nancy) in re-establishing the exclusive use of the block line for measuring activities.            One of the children,
Nathaniel, sticks around and gains access to the group by assigning himself a role ("I'm the guy who watches")
in the activity. It is at this point that our focal child, Darcy, exits the   group to engage in another activity.

Learning Opportunities
Over the course of the period the three girls play with the measuring tape, there are multiple opportunities for
them to learn from (and teach) each other.     We focus here on the experience of our focal child, Darcy, and find
types of learning afforded by the activity can be analytically separated into two rough categories.            The first is
more directly related to the activity of measuring as ordinarily carried out and relates to a set of concepts that
include number identification, dimension (height vs. length), and quantitative comparison (testing whether one
thing is longer  or shorter than another thing).  The other category is not directly tied   to the activity of measuring,
but rather to the physical affordances and constraints of the tape measure as an object. This set includes learning
about the limitations of the material ­ both in terms of its length (the tape can only be stretched a certain
distance)  and   in terms of its strength   (the tape will    collapse  if it is stretched too far  without any    external
support).  Particularly interesting for Darcy and the other girls is a particular affordance of the tape measure
tool: that the tape automatically retracts into the case when released, and that this mechanism will also cause the

                                                      1115  ·   © ISLS

case end to spring toward the tape end when that end is held (or hooked on something). While the learning in
the first category can be related by a knowledgeable observer to mathematics (including geometry), the second
can be related primarily to physics and engineering.
           Over the  course  of     the  activity   we  do      not    necessarily   see a  clear progression towards  mastery  of
particular concepts or skills.         However, we do see the children engaging in negotiation and discussion about
how to do things, trying out terminology with one another, making discoveries, issuing predictions about the
behavior of physical objects (informal hypotheses), and watching to see if their predictions are borne out.
           Learning about measuring: One of the basic sub-tasks involved in measuring is identifying and reading
the numerals printed on the tape.         Anna receives direct instruction in this from the teacher (as described above).
After Darcy joins the group, the girls continue to negotiate how do to this.                    In the excerpt below, the girls are
measuring their sixth object together, and still working out how to read numbers from the tape. Also under
discussion and available for learning are issues of dimension; i.e., that there are different terms to describe
measurements made in different directions (lines 13 and 15), and that this is a distinction worth noting.

29   Susan:    Yeah we'll mea:sure the fri::dge!

           Learning about the constraints and affordances of the object: Over the course of their play activity, the
girls encounter and explore various properties of the tape measure itself. For instance, they (particularly Anna)
display awareness that the tape is limited in length, and concern themselves with limiting the length of their
block wall accordingly. Earlier on, they discover that the strength, or the ability of the tape measure to support
its own weight when extended, is also limited ­ e.g., when measuring a tall cardboard tree, the measuring tape
bends over on itself and Anna yells, "It's too high!"). However, it is a curious affordance of the tool that
captures their interest the most.         That   is the  self-propelling       action    of the tape measure  ­ that  the tape end
automatically retracts into the case, but also the case end can spring back to the tabbed end if the tabbed end is
held in place (see lines 17-18 and 25-27 above).
           That this is a learning experience for Darcy is evidenced at a later moment.                 The girls are measuring a
bookcase by placing the tape measure case on the floor and extending the tape towards the top of the bookcase.
When Anna lets go of the case, which is resting on the floor, Darcy abruptly pulls her hand back and jumps
away from the tabbed end. Evidently, she expects the case to spring up towards the tabbed end (though it does
not because it is too heavy).       Darcy's reaction represents learning in progress.              Her earlier experiences with the
tape measure have led her to form the expectation that the case will always spring towards the tabbed end when
released.   It is fairly certain that she would not have expected a metal case to rise into the air if she had             not had
this experience   with   the tape       measure.    That       the  tape   measure   does   not do what she   expects provides  an
opportunity for Darcy to revise her conceptualization of the properties of this object, potentially gaining a more
complex (though unarticulated) understanding of the interaction between gravity and the pull of the spring
retracting the tape measure into the case.

                                                               1116    ·   © ISLS

            Much later, after the girls have created a wall of blocks for measuring, the girls discover that when the
tape measure is released so that it runs along the block wall, it will act as a projectile and pop up onto the stage
(beyond the spot at which the end was hooked). The first time this happens, the girls react with excitement and
try it again.  The second     try is less successful and meets with less enthusiasm. The third try is                presented below.

20              ((Susan moves chair))
21    Anna:     ((calling out)) Okay. Put ano- another block the::re.

            Four times in all the girls let go of tape measure and it pops onto the stage. The girls display excitement
about this when it happens (in the form of whoops, jumps, and screams). They do not make verbal reference to
it. This activity is in some ways like an experiment.              For instance, as she lets go of the case on the last try, Anna
says, "let's see:::," which suggests that she is orienting to this as trying something out. It is also experiment-like
in that it consists of multiple repetitions of a procedure with slight modifications each time.                          These multiple
repetitions, in which the girls take different roles, allow them to see the phenomenon from different perspectives
and observe which aspects remain stable and which aspects change.                      However, there is no evidence that the
modifications undertaken are designed to produce an effect, especially not of making the tape measure jump
when released.    To the extent that there is a particular purpose indicated, it is to                 add blocks of the right number
and length such that the tape measure will still extend to the end of the block wall (lines 1, 4, 19-21). Otherwise,
the majority of the talk surrounding this activity is about the turn-taking process itself (e.g., "It's my turn.") and
the appropriate performance of roles (e.g., "No. You have to say `let go'!").

Discussion: Peer-regulated Group Activity as Learning Arrangement
We can recognize several advantages of this form of interaction as a learning arrangement for young children.
First, there   appears    to  be strong  social       motivation       for  participating in       these activities. Even  when   their
participation is not solicited nor reliably rewarded by other children--as it tends to be by parents in the home
environment--children actively seek out and work hard to gain entrance into these activities. We might say that
the  activities  exhibit   something    like    a    gravitational     pull on  children.        Furthermore, these   activities afford
different   types of  learning   opportunities.        Children    negotiate    with each        other in guiding    and regulating the
activity themselves--as such they have increased opportunity to both exercise agency and to develop skills at
collaborating with others. Children can position themselves as both learners and teachers in such interaction.
The lack of stable and explicit goal orientation gives children a great deal of freedom to explore the aspects of a
phenomenon that most interest them (Rogoff, 1990). These peer-organized learning arrangements also seem to
offer enhanced opportunities for embodied participation and experiential learning, as children move about the
rooms with little constraint, drawing into their activity a variety of different types of artifacts and structures.
            There also are disadvantages when compared with adult-mediated interaction. These have to do with
the interactional challenges of the activity and the lack of adult support in developing an activity in the direction
of disciplinary knowledge. In child-regulated peer group activity the interactional demands fall squarely on the
shoulders of the children themselves. Our analysis of this activity shows that gaining entrance is itself a difficult
maneuver--while one our focal children succeeds, the other attempts to participate but is unsuccessful (even
reprimanded for her attempt by the core trio of girls). Similarly, it is the children who must maintain the activity
and direct it in fruitful and enjoyable directions. Young children may not always be able to do this effectively,
which may be why such activities rarely last as long as the one we analyze in this paper.
            Children also do not experience the same level of interactional support for learning in peer activities as
they do in parent-guided activities. Unlike parents, peers may not monitor for opportunities for teaching and
learning. To the extent that children's activities are monitored, peers are more likely to see shortcomings and

                                                            1117     ·   © ISLS

provide correction than recognize innovation or respond with elaboration. These qualities of peer play do offer
opportunities to develop skills at argumentation and negotiation--part of the collaborative practice of science.
        Another  possibility is that rich opportunities   for learning    may occur but   not get  developed     in  the
direction of disciplinary knowledge. For instance, in the block-measuring activities described above there is no
movement   toward  investigation of  why  the  tape measure    flies. Over  the course  of  the repeated      tries girls
encounter `information' about   the  physical workings    of the   tool; however, they  do  not seem       to engage  in
purposeful or principled experimentation in order to find out more. Without the involvement of knowledgeable
adults or peers there is little opportunity to link this activity to disciplinary principles or practices.
Conclusion
The distinction between formal and informal learning takes on a peculiar status when applied to the lives of very
young children. Though formal education reaches into the mostly informal lives of young children in many
ways, "school" does not neatly map onto "formal" and "home" does not neatly map onto "informal". In fact,
due to the particular social configurations of preschools (versus middle class homes), they seem to offer more
opportunity for the highly informal learning arrangement of uninterrupted, child-organized group play.
        In light of the affordances   and limitations   of  informal  peer-group  interaction  for science      learning
discussed above, it remains to be determined exactly what role participation in this type of activity might play in
a trajectory of `becoming a scientist' or even in building the disciplinary knowledge needed to succeed in
science learning later in school.   Our analysis    supports  pedagogical   practices  that take  advantage      of  the
opportunities for peer learning afforded by the preschool classroom setting by allowing children the freedom to
self-organize into groups and pursue activities of their choice. On the other hand, our analysis also suggests that
strategic adult support, provided at key moments in children's peer play, could provide disciplinary connections
and promote deeper learning of a kind that may not happen when children play together without intervention.
