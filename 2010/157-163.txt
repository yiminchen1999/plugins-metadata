Symposium Description
In this symposium we present recent research on spatial analysis and modeling as these forms of spatial
thinking are practiced in the professions, and in interactions between professionals and public stakeholders.
Our objective is to provide descriptive and comparative analysis of learning in this new socio-technical
domain. Authors of a recent survey of research on learning and use of spatial thinking (NRC, 2006) argue
that a wide variety of advances in science and technology made over the past century would have been
unlikely or even impossible without innovations in ways of representing, analyzing, and thinking about
spatial structure. Despite steady progress in basic cognitive research on how spatial thinking develops and
is learned (Newcombe & Huttenlocher, 2000), there are many open questions about how people learn to
think spatially across different domains (Liben, 2003), and equally, how forms of spatial analysis might
contribute to what is taught in K-12 schools (Edelson, Gordin & Pea, 1999; Enyedy & Mukhopadhyay,
2007). Moreover, while there is some speculation about how new technologies might change spatial
thinking (e.g., Uttal, 2000), there has been little research in this area.
       Comparative case studies of doing and learning spatial analysis and modeling in professional work
settings can provide new insights into how people learn spatial thinking, outside the psychological
laboratory and in settings where spatial technologies and work practices are rapidly changing. In three case
study papers, we ask on how professionals change scale and modality, strategically, while at work in
different practices: physical anthropology, urban planning, and emergency medical communications. In
each case, we ask how changes in scale and modality both extend the body over time and space, and bring
disparate aspects of the world into the body as proximal, modality-specific experiences (Barsalou, 2008;
Gallese & Lakoff, 2007). In each case, we consider problems of coordination (how are different scales and
modalities layered together in practice), of learning (how are newcomers inducted into practice), and of
innovation (how are new technical practices developed and incorporated into existing work practice).
       Comparative case studies reported in this symposium use a common set of methods that focus on
learning as changes in interaction, biography, and group history (Scribner, 1985). In each case, we engage
in three study phases. In the first phase, we identify a project work group and collect ethnographic data,
including semi-structured biographical interviews with central participants. In the second phase, we capture
detailed video recordings of naturally occurring work sessions, and we index these by topics and events for
further study. Selected episodes are transcribed for detailed interaction analysis. In the third phase, we
conduct video-elicited interviews with central participants, asking for their (separate) understandings of
episodes we have selected as critical in our analysis of their work and learning. Video recordings and
video-elicited interviews provide material for our analysis of learning as changes in interaction, while
biographical interviews and participant observation provide material for our analysis of learning as
movement along professional trajectories.
       Our analysis of professional practice follows from our recognition that abstractions such as `scale'
are made meaningful as situated constructs:
       `scale' is rendered most meaningful in its development as an empirical generalization--a concept
       made real by building up an understanding of complex and dynamic relationships and processes in
       context.
       (Howitt, 2003, p. 151)
Moreover, our comparative analysis across cases allows our approach to develop and test theoretical
constructs of scale-in-practice. Of particular focus in this symposium are the relationships of scale to the
modalities of the body. In his examination of undergraduate physics students, Nespor (1994) considers how
students, as physicists in training, "move out of everyday bodily space-time and into the textual space-time
of the discipline" (p. 78). A progression from scales and modalities of the body to scales and modalities of
representation is also generally supported in Actor Network accounts of scientific work (e.g., Latour's
(1988) account of the circulation of textual "immutable mobiles").
       However, across the present cases of professional practice we pursue a contrasting argument that
asserts the significance of scales and modalities of the body across three forms of genesis of professional
practice. In the microgenesis of routine professional practice, experienced or more `full' (Lave & Wenger,

                                               157  ·  © ISLS

1991) members of practice engage in scale coordination and assembly that involve specific disciplinary
relations of embodied scales/modalities with representational scales/modalities. In other terms, our spatio-
temporal analysis makes evident how `full' members of professional practices are "variably scaled"
(Nespor, 2004) within particular practices of the body and coordinated practices of representation. In the
ontogenesis of new members to practice, newcomers become "rescaled" through practice, by bringing
particularly scaled histories to present practice and by learning new practices of scale coordination and
assembly. Innovations to practice--the sociogenesis of new ways of working--also involve new relations
among scales and modalities of the body and of representations. Resources and models from other
disciplines or practices--differently scaled and with different modal relations--are often the engines of
such transformation. Thus, our account across these diverse cases is not an argument concerning the
replacement or loss of the body in representational practice; rather, we argue that the particular relations
between embodied scales and modalities and representational scales and modalities, and the variable and
extensibility of the "professional body" in these relations, provides an important and understudied account
of professional practice.

In this paper we report from a study of a group of physical anthropologists, focusing on joint activity by the
group's faculty leader (Tom) and one of his advanced graduate students (Wanda) as they worked to
"ground truth" a model of colonial succession by walking through a settlement they were excavating in the
highlands of Peru. In this and other work activities of this scientific group, researchers deliberately moved
between different spatial scales and representational modalities, in support of analysis, modeling, and
research management. Newcomers to the group tended to work on individual dwellings (structures) within
the colonial settlement, restricting their contributions to excavation and digital stratigraphy of particular
features. Over time, their work expanded in scale to include work across structures, and with full group
membership, to model changes in related structures over time. As part of a modeling innovation, underway
during our case study, new ways of showing cultural behavior at the settlement scale provided group
members with new, embodied resources for making explanatory inferences about colonial succession.
        Tom's research investigated changes in the built environment of an Incan settlement in 16th
Century Peru as an instrument of Franciscan colonization. For Tom, a major disciplinary objective was to
model relations between phenomena at structure-scale and settlement-scale for a group of people who lived
centuries ago during a transition between Incan and Franciscan rule. His group studied the settlement for
four years, excavating structures in the summer and organizing and analyzing data during the academic
year. In typical work, students focused on one or two particular structures, digging, collecting, and
documenting while in the field, and creating digital stratigraphic representations back at the university. At a
national conference where the group presented, students reporting on their structure excavations, while
Tom used their findings for his analysis at the level of the whole settlement.
        In the most recent field season, the group returned to Peru for a variety of tasks, one of which was
to "ground truth" paths between structures in the settlement. Their earlier maps of the settlement, derived
from aerial photographs and field surveys, were not precise enough to support a modeling innovation under
development by Tom as the lead investigator. Using methods borrowed from network analysis, Tom
modeled movement through the settlement into a central plaza, keeping track of what residents of each
structure could observe as their neighbors passed along least-effort paths to the plaza. This measure of
"observational power" was calculated for each structure (household) in the settlement, and could be
compared before and after architectural changes undertaken by the Franciscans. Not only were new
buildings constructed and old buildings renovated under Spanish colonization, but a new plaza was also
built. Tom conjectured that changes in the built environment had drastic effects on the daily lives of
residents, changing their social status and relations of power within the settlement. However, to establish

this new kind of modeling within the discipline, Tom had to insure that his maps correctly represented the
location and orientation of each structure's doorway and paths between structures and the central plaza.
         Tom and Wanda visited each structure and walked these paths in an effort to "ground truth" the
settlement model. For one of the structures they visited, building that Tom and Wanda noticed that the
original door, shown in their existing settlement model, had been blocked by a terrace for another building,
and converted to a window. Tom reasoned that the terraced building must have been built later, blocking
the original door, so a new doorway would have been built after architectural changes accompanying
Franciscan rule. Wanda, standing at the remodeled door/window, immediately picked up on Tom's train of
thought:
    Wanda:      So, I mean this would be a good one to look at changes from,=
    Tom:        [right
    Wanda:      [like earlier use, versus later [use
    Tom:                                      [yeah, yeah. Yeah=we could model this        [as a
                doorway,
    Wanda:      [Model this one, and the [other one.
    Tom:                                 [and that one. Yeah. Yeah there's a doorway here.
    Wanda:      Uh huh. A::and, [that o::one,
    Tom:                          [this is, one side and then this is the other side here.
         Wanda related modeling the doorway and path for this particular building to the larger goal of the
analysis, comparing the everyday experience of residents of the settlement before and after Franciscan
colonial rule. As he listened to Wanda, Tom got increasingly excited, and evaluated (positively) her move
into modeling at settlement scale ("yeah, yeah. Yeah"). They began to finish each other's sentences in
overlapping talk, describing how to model earlier versus later use. The two then attempted to walk the path
to the colonial plaza. After several starts and stops and consultations with a settlement map Tom was
carrying on his laptop, Wanda exclaimed, out of breath, "When they rerouted it, in the colonial part? They
like, you know, it was a pain in the ass for those people!"
         As to the microgenesis of routine professional practice, this episode highlights the problem of
coordinating representations of architectural structure and cultural behavior at different scales. While
guided by a planimetric view of the settlement on his tough book computer, Tom and Wanda still struggled
to find structures, paths, and architectural features at a (much needed) scale of walking between structures.
On finding unexpected architectural features as impediments to their own mobility (a blocked door, paths
interrupted by a terrace), Tom and Wanda rapidly expanded their analytical scale to that of the whole
settlement (relationships between buildings) over a time period of colonial succession. The existing, flawed
representation (in Tom's laptop) was coordinated with on the ground experience to repair the model and to
imagine a new line of analysis.
         As to the ontogenesis of members of the practice, Wanda's reasoning here operated at a scale
larger than the individual structures she had excavated during previous field seasons. As the summer
progressed, Wanda was well on her way to becoming a full participant in the discipline, exhibiting facility
with shifting scales to reason about relations between structure and settlement scales. Also during the
summer season, she found a new settlement in the highlands, which had not yet been excavated, and began
to create settlement-scale maps that would support a dissertation project during subsequent summer
fieldwork.
         As to the sociogenesis of new ways of working, in this episode we see Tom and Wanda struggling
to provide accurate architectonic data for a new, network modeling technique. Whereas earlier field work
and analysis was devoted to finding architectural changes to individual structures, the "observational
power" network analysis demanded that Tom strengthen his modeling of architectural features of individual
structures (doorways) as well as the paths connecting these structures to the central plaza as part of the
settlement's daily life under two administrative orders (Incan, Franciscan). Tom and Wanda used their
bodies at walking, human scale, They walked among structures at the site, locating themselves in relation to
other structures and within the map representation in the laptop, repeatedly shifting between structure and
settlement scales to imagine changes in daily life for past-time residents. As both of their bodies stumbled
through uneven and steep terrain and their breathing became labored, Wanda made a significant
observation about a result Franciscan renovation, that it resulted in "a pain in the ass" for people who lived
in parts of the settlement that lost more direct access to the plaza.

  Changing the Structure of Planning Participation by Moving
                                          Across Scales

This paper discusses how urban planners seek out and borrow innovative ways of coordinating scales from
other planning departments across the nation to more successfully induct public participants into the
planning process. Planners routinely imagine possible      changes for communities and urban areas, but in an
age of participatory planning, need public backing to leverage support from other governmental agencies
involved in implementing    change.  Incorporating local   residents and business owners into the planning
process necessitates a new kind of scale coordination so that participants can eventually "see" their
community as a planner. While maps at the planimetric scale are commonly used in public meetings and
provide a visual of a large area that is not within reach of the body, some planners promote "charettes," or
workshops, where residents and other stakeholders experience their community at a walking-scale,
accompanied by a planner.    Becoming intrinsic to the space under consideration is talked about by planners
as having considerable advantages over extrinsically dominating the area as one does when viewing a map.
This innovative technique of regaining the body at a walking-scale, and coordinating it with a
representational scale in community workshops, is an effort to simultaneously instruct and construct a
participating public in the "professional vision" (Goodwin, 1994) of urban planners.
        The data for this paper is taken from a professional workgroup meeting occurring in a
governmental planning   department located in  a medium-sized, mid-South city    (Gotham).    The purpose of
the meeting is to discuss innovative ways in which other cities' planning departments have facilitated
public participation in "community update" or "visioning" workshops.      Currently in Gotham,    these
workshops have residents, business owners, and other stakeholders seated around a table-sized map that
represents the community    under review. Facilitated by   a planner, each group of participants is urged to
imagine possible changes for the community, and to point out aspects that should remain the same.
Participants are encouraged to draw or write on the map with a permanent marker to make desires for their
community visible for the duration of the meeting.    Unfortunately, public participants spend a considerable
amount of time in these visioning workshops trying to understand the model before them, asking about
colors, symbols, and the locations of places that bear personal import.
        While relying on maps and scaled representations of an area is commonplace in the practice of
planners, these models tend to breakdown for newcomers and create more hurdles than supports for design.
In response, five Gotham planners in a workgroup meeting were discussing ways to guide residents and
business owners into the model, in the hope that conceptualizing space and imagining possibilities for that
space might be easier.  One innovation from  a West     Coast planning department   was arranging a visioning
workshop (or "charette") so as to feel more like running a shopping errand-- entering a store, running into
familiar faces, and having  a chat. In this scenario, the planning workshop would take place in a local
storefront, rather than in a church basement, and involve planners, business owners, and residents more
informally discussing ideas for community change. A map of the community was close-by for referencing.
Once a few ideas came to the fore, a planner would escort the participants into the street space for a stroll,
also called a "site tour." The Gotham  planner who    first mentioned this idea, Tanya, states, "I always
thought it would be interesting to take people out to the environment we're trying   to change."  It is during
this site tour that planners could highlight for public participants the community characteristics of which
they take notice, and vice versa. Another Gotham planner described the walking-scale charette as a way to
"really be out there."
        As to the microgenesis of routine professional practice, this episode demonstrates how
incorporating a walk along a community's business corridor into the usual design review can coordinate
embodied scale (the pace of walking, what can be seen) with much larger representational scales.     Taking a
walk down a familiar street with a planner might allow community stakeholders to insert their own
experiences into the planner-created, representational   view of that space. While coordination of  embodied
(intrinsic) views with planimetric (extrinsic) views comes naturally to planners, public participants in the
planning process often struggle with this coordination. From the perspective of professional planners,
providing public participants with a chance to experience proposed developments at a walking scale may

                                                  160  ·  © ISLS

help to convey planners' proposals. And because urban planning increasingly requires public input and
support, providing these forms of coordination is increasingly important. In response, the planning
department in our case was searching for techniques of scale coordination to invite new forms of public
participation in urban planning.
          In terms of the ontogenesis for members of the practice, Tanya's site tour idea (borrowed from
another planning department) was quickly taken up by the other four planners. In interview she reported
making "good" proposals for neighborhood developments, only to face staunch opposition from
community residents who gave little evidence of understanding the proposal. Tanya's search for how other
departments managed this problem identified a strategy that promised, at a personal level, to give Tanya a
new way of working. She described her desire to transport members of a neighborhood association to
another part of town where they could walk through and around a novel kind of development, as opposed to
experiencing only pictures and maps.  "Sometimes [residents] really have to see it to get the idea," she
reported.
          Regarding sociogenesis, or changes in the collective practice of planning, planners in Gotham
already realized that the daily, embodied experience of residents living in a particular place, on a particular
street, next to a particular house, was not well represented in the maps and models that they designed. As a
proposed innovation in their practice, borrowed during a systematic search of other cities' visioning
techniques, the storefront charrette promised to offer public participants a new way to experience the
contrast between existing and proposed urban space. By partnering with local businesses to host street level
activities in which planners and members of the public move between neighborhood scale maps and
walking tours, these planners began to organize for a different way of constructing/instructing public input
and political support for departmental initiatives. This new form of charrette extended to public participants
many of the same changes in scale that planners typically rely on in their own work--shifts between an
extrinsic perspective in plan views and an intrinsic perspective while walking through neighborhoods to
imagine changes in the built environment.
