        However, for students, the task is wrought with challenges. Even as representations are meant

species captured  scientific thought. Thereafter,  it became    an  icon of  evolution, and    firmly associated  with
biological understanding  (Figure    1). In  modern   biology,  tree diagrams   such  as   cladograms   have  become
invaluable tools for scientific reasoning. They have played roles in such diverse areas as the discovery of new
biological compounds, the restoration of damaged ecosystems, and the understanding of the functional role of
genes. Such representations are gateways to what biologists call tree thinking, which, contrary to much of
evolutionary reasoning before the 20th century, recognizes the divergence of species, and the interconnected
relationships between them (O'Hara, 1997).

Figure 1. Early illustrations of species relationships by Swainson, 1836-1837 (left); Darwin, 1837 (center); and
                                            Ernst Haeckel, 1891 (right)

        Cladograms come in many forms, but generally consist of interconnected lines, or branches, which
represent the lineages of groups of organisms referred to as taxa. Taxa are named at their branch tips, and nodes,
where two such branches intersect, represent the most recent ancestral traits shared by those taxa (see examples
in Figures 2,  3, and 5). By   identifying   the relative  recency  of these ancestries,   one can  reason about  the
relatedness among the taxa depicted. Experienced biologists use cladograms to test evolutionary hypotheses, to
learn about   the characteristics of  extinct and  newly     discovered  species, and   so to  better  understand the
relationships among   organisms   on  earth.  The  ability to read   cladograms   is thus  crucial for understanding
fundamental concepts of evolutionary biology (Baum, Smith, & Donovan, 2005; Catley , 2006) and is as well an

important component of scientific literacy. Educators are moreover urged to teach these tools of professional
practice (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2001; National Research Council, 1996).
         Yet, despite their simple forms, there is growing evidence that students find tree diagrams difficult and
are prone to  misinterpret them.     Consequently,  one  strand   of research  has  begun  to document    the  types of
mistakes that students make when make when reading cladograms. Common errors include reading increasing
qualities in species from the bottom toward the top of the diagram, reading progress across the branch tips, and
viewing the cladogram as a story of linear transformation rather than as one of divergence toward species
diversity (e.g., Gregory, 2008; Halverson, Pires, & Abell, 2008; Meir, Perry, Herron, & Kingsolver, 2007;
Novick & Catley, 2007). Other research has explored the factors that influence cladogram interpretation. For
example, Novick & Catley (2007) point to the Gestalt principle of Good Continuation as a perceptual hindrance
to  interpreting a  particular form   of cladogram. Catley    and   Novick   (2008) moreover    find that this form  of
cladogram most prone to misinterpretation is also the one most prevalent in biology textbooks..
         It is clear from existing research that meaning from a cladogram is constructed by the viewer, as it is in
the case of other scientific representations. It is also clear that we cannot design more effective interventions to
support  that construction     until we  better understand    the interaction  of   the multiple factors  involved   in
interpretation. This symposium brings together researchers active in the budding area of tree-thinking. Together,
the papers tackle the many dimensions of interpretation 8 be they representational, cognitive, educational, or
developmental 8 and address the mechanism of diagrammatic reasoning through different methodological and
theoretical lenses.
         In the first paper, Phillips, Novick, and Catley examine the role of prior content knowledge in tree

specific knowledge of taxa depicted in a tree diagram can interfere with students correctly reasoning based on
the structure of the diagram. This carefully designed study contributes to untangling the influences of conceptual
knowledge and perception in diagrammatic interpretation. In this manner, the authors provide us with valuable
foundational components to consider in the design of an effective tree-thinking learning progression based in
representations.
         Meanwhile, Matuk and Uttal filter out specific content from the cladogram in order to more closely
examine the perceptual and representational issues underlying the challenges with tree-thinking. In their study,

represent social relationships. However, they also observe that the common errors made reading cladograms
persisted no matter whether the student was in the evolution or the non-evolution condition. Their work at once
demonstrates the powerful influence of visual structure independent of content, as well as the influence of
content beliefs on representational acts. It furthermore suggests more intuitive representational forms that may
help support novice understanding of standard cladograms.
         Next, Ainsworth and Saffer present a surprising finding. Given appropriate but only limited training
(10 to 15 minutes), they find that children as young as seven years old can be successfully taught to read these
complicated representations. On the one hand, their work reinforces the messages of the first two papers, that

other domains; and on the other, it suggests promise for developmentally appropriate educational interventions.
The authors encourage us to imagine possibilities beyond conventional educational standards, and challenge us
to rethink when, and what we consider to be developmentally appropriate material for students to learn.
         Finally,   Halverson   presents  findings  on   the  impact  of   novel  instructional  interventions  among

although these often only become clear through better understanding the problem.
         An important component of scientific literacy is to understand the tools of scientific practice. Each of
the papers in this symposium addresses issues of scientific literacy within the discipline of biology. Through the
specific case of evolutionary trees, the authors consider important questions of representational competency:
What are the conceptual and perceptual influences on diagrammatic interpretation? What is the role of content
knowledge  vs.   perception?   How    does tree  thinking   develop  from    childhood  through  high school,  through
college? What interventions and scaffolds can educators provide to support tree-thinking? Together, the authors
apply multiple methodological and theoretical perspectives to paint a more complete picture of the reasoning
process and of diagrammatic interpretation and understanding. Each seeks to better understand when and how
students imbue diagrammatic marks with evolutionary meaning; and each takes their findings a step further to
suggest useful learning progressions, designs for more effective interventions, and scaffolds to help students

promises lively interaction among presenters and members of the audience. It is an opportunity to discuss issues
of interest to researchers concerned with how representations mediate our understanding of complex topics, as
well as to those specifically interested in biological learning.

In 1996, the National Research Council put forth a set of guidelines for K-12 science education that state that
students be introduced to the theory of evolution in primary and secondary schools. Tree thinking is an essential
tool for understanding evolutionary hierarchies, based on the distribution of derived characters among a set of
taxa; yet, there is little research devoted to the acquisition of tree thinking skills during development. The
present study examines the cognitive processes that underlie high school $%0*!&%$3 abilities to engage in tree
thinking. We compare $%0*!&%$3 responses to those recently obtained from a college sample of students with
weaker and stronger backgrounds in biology (Novick & Catley, 2009). These results will provide critical
information regarding the developmental trajectory of tree thinking skills during adolescence and early
adulthood.

                                       Figure 2. An insect cladogram

Methods
60 students (31 males, 29 females) who were enrolled in a 10th grade high school biology class at a public high
school in a rural area of western North Carolina (M=15.65, range of 15-17 years) completed a 4-page booklet,
which  included a cladogram   and  three questions    on   each   page.  Students were   instructed to utilize  each
cladogram  to answer   questions regarding the evolutionary       relations among  several taxa, including     insects
(Figure 2), dinosaurs (Figure 3), placental mammals, and marsupial mammals. I%0*!&%$3 tree-thinking skills
were assessed in five domains including identifying a character shared by a most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) and a set of taxa based on a given derived character. Students were also asked to identify clades (i.e.,
monophyletic groups) and evaluate the relative evolutionary distance (degree of relatedness) between taxa. A
fifth skill required students to make inferences about what taxa are likely to share a derived character (the focus
of the analysis presented in this symposium).   Students    were    told that  birds are warm-blooded   (dinosaurs
cladogram) or that termites digest cellulose (insects cladogram) and were asked which taxon is most likely to
share this character. The answers (T-Rex and hissing cockroach) can be seen in Figure 3 and 2, respectively.

Results
College students with a stronger background in biology had the highest number of correct responses overall.
However, all students were more likely to make correct inferences when asked about insects as opposed to
dinosaurs (Table 1).

I%0*!&%$3 justifications provide further information regarding their tree-thinking abilities. Across samples,
students appealed to the best evidence 8 most recent common ancestry or evolutionary relatedness 8 only to
support correct inferences. In comparison, students who made incorrect inferences frequently provided
categorical justifications (e.g., hawks share warm-bloodedness with birds because they are birds; see Table 2).
High school students and college students with weaker backgrounds in biology were significantly more likely to
provide this justification when asked about dinosaurs than insects.

These results indicate that prior knowledge of the specific taxa can interfere with successful tree thinking.
I%0*!&%$3 justifications underscore the conflict they had with reasoning with the information that birds are
dinosaurs. Our results suggest that for younger students, as well as those with less biological knowledge, the
combination of shaky biological knowledge and evidence presented in an unfamiliar diagram leads to poor
understanding of macroevolution. The present baseline results will be used to help guide the development of
empirically-based curricula and instructional practices at the high school and undergraduate levels that will lead
eventually to a more widespread appreciation for and understanding of tree thinking.

Inventing a representation of relatedness

Prior research has shown that reasoning with cladograms is a skill that must be taught. Novice students, who do
not understand the peculiarities of the representational system, can rely only upon prior content knowledge and
perceptual resources (e.g., embodied and culturally-learned spatial metaphors (Tversky, Kugelmass, & Winter,
1991) and Gestalt perception (Novick & Catley, 2007) to make sense of them. The problem is that $%0*!&%$3
prior knowledge is sometimes incorrect or incomplete. They rely upon misconceived folk theories of evolution
as a linear transformation through successive stages; and their intuitive perceptions often counter the obscure

symbolic rules by which the cladogram operates. It is such that even with instruction, many students tend to
make errors when interpreting cladograms (Meir et al., 2007), which keeps them from mastering an important
component evolutionary reasoning.
         In spite of the difficulties this diagram presents, it is nonetheless a standard representational tool within
the field of biology. As such, designers are faced with a different task: How to design an effective learning
sequence that addresses the issues students are known to encounter. Where previous work has both identified the
common errors that students make when reasoning with cladograms (Gregory, 2008; Meir et al., 2007), and as
well has examined   the reasoning   processes underlying    those  errors (Halverson  et al., 2008)  this research
addresses more fundamental questions of the nature of representation and of intuitive symbolization in the
domain of evolution. Specifically, we ask (1) What kinds of representations will students intuitively invent to
represent the central concept of cladograms, B)!1+%!*&!$$JC (2) How does the act of inventing a representation
influence the interpretations students later make of the standard cladogram? and (3) How do $%0*!&%$3 inventions
and interpretations differ when the content of the representation does or does not concern evolution?

Methods
To investigate our questions, we conducted individual interviews with 33 undergraduate students. Of these, 22
students were first asked to invent a diagram (on a tablet pc) to depict the relationships among either a group of
species with shared traits (the Evo   condition), or  among   a   group   of children with   shared toys  (the    Toy
condition), and to discuss why they invented what they did. Except for the content of the problem, the data sets
given to students in the Evo and Toy conditions were equivalent. In the control condition, 11 students were
asked to sketch and discuss any image they recalled of evolution. Afterwards, they were shown a solution to the
problem in the form of a standard cladogram. In a series of open-ended and fixed choice questions, all 33
students were then asked to use this diagram to reason about the relative relatedness among the items depicted,
and to interpret its various symbolic attributes. Interviews were video recorded and transcribed for later analysis

Results
Students drew  upon a   rich array  of representational    resources to depict  "relatedness," including  familiar
representational forms (e.g., Venn diagrams, networks, graphs, tables) and devices for organizing information
(e.g., colour cues, systematic variation of graphic qualities). With one exception, only the Evo condition elicited
temporal-based inventions,   which  depicted  linear  progressions   from an  ancestral to a  more  contemporary
species (n = 7 vs. n = 1). Meanwhile, only the Toy condition appeared to elicit propositional-like statements (n =
2 vs. n = 0). D-!$!( .2$!)9+%#.&$( $0''!$%( 4+)%#/01+)( ,+&&!)$( #&( :-#/-( $%0*!&%$3( 2!1#!5$( +2.0%( %-!( /.&%!&%( :#11(

         However, our   qualitative analysis  of $%0*!&%$3  reasoning   processes with   the  standard cladogram,
showed that students that first invented a representation appeared to focus more attention on the relationships
depicted. They tended to describe the symbolic functions of lines and nodes as indicating conceptual relations,
rather than as timelines or as paths of change as did the students in the control condition. The latter rather tended
to interpret the cladogram in terms of a misconceived folk theory of evolution. That is, despite the /1+*.')+,3$
branching structure, students in the control condition described the progressive transformation of a species
through a series of states from left to right of the graphic space. Our findings extend prior work on inventing
representations (e.g., Schwartz, 2006) by contributing a particularly challenging example from the domain of
biology. They suggest that an opportunity to consider the problem of representing relatedness helps students
better understand the standard diagram as a solution, no matter the kind of representation these students first
invented (e.g., Cox & Brna, 1995). The fact that common errors made reasoning with the cladogram were still
evident among all students, suggests the powerful influence of visual structure and of perceptual processes on
interpretation. Our findings suggest intermediate representations and activities that might serve to bridge novice
and expert understanding (Roschelle, 1996).

Can children read trees?

The research reported in other papers in this symposium reveal difficulties in adult and teenage interpretation of
cladograms. This paper explores if children in middle childhood could interpret cladograms given minimal
training and if so what factors might influence their success. In particular, we explored if their reasoning was
influenced by the species represented or the way that cladogram was presented (its rotation).

                           Figure 5. Pigeon cladogram in RRRR rotation

Methods
13 boys and 15 girls aged 7:1 to 11:11 years were trained for 15 minutes on K5+@!3 cladograms before answering
8 questions on each of 4 new cladograms. Children were introduced to key terms before proceeding to finding
common ancestors, determining relatedness, how synapomorphies (features) are inherited and the arbitrary
nature of branching. Training was designed to support four types of reasoning: finding the most common recent
ancestor of two species; identifying a $4!/#!$3 features based upon its ancestry; describing which animals have
particular features; and determining which species are most closely related to a particular example. They then
answered eight questions on each of four new trees (one each of the different contents and rotation
counterbalanced by Graeco Latin square). After every second answer they were prompted to explain their
reasoning. A [4 by 4 by 4 by 4] repeated measures study examined: species depicted in the cladogram; branch
rotation, the depth of tree searched and type of question. Just those answers including only correct responses
were considered correct (e.g. BL-#/- animals are most closely related to the green spiny 1#M+)*JCN K+11#'+%.) and

P-#1*)!&3$ performance was surprisingly good with an average of 56% of answers completely correct. This is
significantly above chance (Ancestor: 25%, Feature/Relation: 6.67%, Animal: 3.22%).

Results
Species represented influenced performance (F(3,81)=9.63, p<0.001). Children reasoned with flea (45%) more
poorly than pigeon (63%) and human (64%) cladograms. Other researchers (e.g. Evans, 2006) have found
poorer evolutionary reasoning by children about invertebrates that, in our case, cannot be explained simply by
unfamiliarity (as piloting ensured these were known insects). However, Philips, Novick & Catley (this
symposium) found insect cladograms were associated with better performance than dinosaur cladograms. There
was no evidence of the human cladogram leading to different reasoning. Rotation had no impact (F(3,81)=1.87).
It may be that children have yet to develop these biases or potentially they did not affect overall accuracy but
did affect /-#1*)!&3$ erroneous strategies. P-#1*)!&3$ performance worsened as the depth of tree that needed to
be searched increased F(3,81)=28.58, p<0.001,  2 = .51): Level one questions (82%) were answered more
accurately than any other level (level 2 (53%) level 3 (51%) and level 4 (45%). It seems wise to recommend that
cladograms for children should be relatively shallow.
       Children found some types of question easier than others (F(3,81)=10.48, p<0.001,      2 = .28).
Questions about relations (39%) were answered worse than those concerning ancestors (69%) and animals
(63%). Performance on the ancestor questions is particularly encouraging as it is a key skill that other tree-

oldest 68%.
        This study suggests that after a short amount of training children can begin to reason with cladograms.
This has important implications for biological education as tree-thinking could be used with younger children
than has previously been considered appropriate (our results suggest from around nine year upwards). Naturally,
much of the complexity of tree-thinking will remain hard for this age group (as it is for adults) but given
demonstration of this basic competency researchers can now determine how best to teach children to tree-think
and to further explore which cladogram designs help novice tree-thinkers.

Evolutionary biologists see biology through the perspective of phylogeny, or evolutionary history. However, it
is clear that most students do not interpret trees in the same manner as evolutionary biologists (Baum et al.,
2005; Gregory, 2008; Halverson, Abell, Friedrichsen, & Pires, 2009; Halverson et al., 2008). The alternative
types of reasoning students use can cause them to generate a variety of responses when interpreting and using
phylogenetic trees (Halverson, 2008). Yet, few studies have focused on why students misinterpret trees or how
students can overcome these misconceptions to develop internalized tree thinking skill. The purpose of this
study was to examine how undergraduates developed and used phylogenetic trees during a plant systematics
course as well as identify/design scaffolds to facilitate improvements in core skill development.

Research Design
This study took place in the lecture section of an upper-level, plant systematics course at a Midwestern research
extensive university during the Spring 2007, 2008, and 2009 semesters. This course was organized primarily
around phylogenetic tree thinking. Students were engaged in interpreting and building phylogenies in addition to
learning about plant systematics. I used open-ended student responses from two-tiered pre/posttests, a two-part
interview series, weekly reflective journal entries, field notes from course observations, and course assessments
to learn how 87 upper-level undergraduate science majors enrolled in a plant systematics course interpreted
phylogenetic trees and developed tree thinking skills. I utilized all transcripts, field notes, expanded observation
notes, and  documents in data      analysis. I wrote profiles   describing each $%0*!&%3$ reasoning  when      using
phylogenetic trees. Throughout the construction of each student profile, I returned to the data sources to test my
interpretations of student responses and find additional supporting evidence. I inductively coded the profiles to
identify reasoning students used when reading trees and their reactions to instructional interventions. I compared
the coded student profiles to identify themes. Once the themes were identified, I triangulated findings using
secondary data sources to ensure the research findings represented accurate interpretations of the data. I wrote
rich descriptions of $%0*!&%$3 tree thinking skills and documented themes that emerged from the data about
effective instructional scaffolds.

Findings
I identified 13 major challenges students encounter when developing tree thinking skills: (1) Overcoming prior
ideas about organisms and using a tree to draw conclusions; (2) Visualizing how branches can rotate; (3)
Reading from the tips rather than nodes; (4) Mapping a species lineage from tip to root of a tree; (5) Comparing
patterns of relationships among trees; (6) Lumping organisms on single characteristics rather than looking at
them holistically; (7) Ignoring critical data and/or using uninformative evidence to construct a tree; (8)
Difficulties transferring empirical data into a tree illustrating evolutionary relationships; (9) Creating consensus
nodes to address discrepancies; (10) Altering the format or orientation of the tree alters the relationships
depicted; (11) Generating accurate, branching, hierarchical representations; (12) Using trees to reconstructing
ancestral states; (13) Comparing representations to identify the most supported tree.
        Two instructional interventions were used in the course (e.g., a hypothetical plant exercise and a pipe
cleaner phylogeny activity) Students perceived the pipe cleaner phylogeny activity as the most effective
instructional intervention. With the pipe cleaner tree manipulative, students could physically bend and rotate the
pipe cleaners into new shapes, directions, and different topologies without altering the relationships. Students
began manipulating the pipe cleaner trees by swiveling the branches, and came to see that nodes to determine
relationships rather than the tips. For example, after the activity he suggested that BThat when studying trees,
one should focus on -/4"&50 and knew Btrees can be displayed in different formats while still showing the same

provided a novel context for phylogenetic trees that was more effective than traditional printed phylogenetic

In the presentation, I will elaborate on how this instructional intervention helped students overcome four main
challenges: namely numbers 2, 3, 4 and 7 above
         Some instructional resources (e.g., University of California Museum of Paleontology, 2009) have
attempted to address some of the listed tree thinking challenges by explaining how scientists interpret and use
data as evidence to build phylogenetic trees. However, these resources do not provide opportunities for students
to practice tree thinking nor do they provide scaffolds to facilitate tree building skills. Thus, while tree thinking
challenges are sometimes acknowledged, they are not always explicitly addressed in ways that help students
overcome the challenges and, in turn, improve tree thinking skills. Few studies focus on instructional strategies
to help students overcome challenges (Gendron, 2000; Meir et al., 2005). There are numerous published lessons
that propose activities using phylogenetic trees or are aimed at helping students develop tree thinking (over 50
published in the American Biology Teacher alone). However, none of these activities is grounded in research on
how students overcome identified challenges or on how students learn core tree thinking skills. Additionally,
published instructional activities (e.g., Gendron, 2000; Meir et al., 2005) assume students are aware that trees
contain information on evolutionary histories and can interpret and build these representations. I have found that
this is not the case. My study used research-based activities to help students overcome the major challenges
associated with tree thinking, something novel to tree thinking instruction.  I found that the research-based
instructional interventions helped students overcome challenges with tree thinking at the same time they
facilitated $%0*!&%$3 development of core tree thinking skills. By investigating how undergraduates learn tree
thinking during three semesters of a plant systematics course, this study adds to our understanding of critical
elements necessary for continuing to improve instruction with phylogenetic trees and maximize the potential of
evolution education.
