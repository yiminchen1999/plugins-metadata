                                about Videogame Authorship
         A bstract: This exploratory case study describes how middle school youth authored videogames at an
         urban summer camp using Kodu, a visual programming language and game creation tool. The study
         details how the youth took on authorship and gave and withdrew agency to their intended game players
         through  a process  of  continuous  revision. Connections     to traditional literacy are made   and future
         research on the transfer of literacy practices between informal and formal learning environments are
         suggested.

Introduction1Youth as Producers
Youth production of videogames and other media has been largely ignored by researchers (Peppler & Kafai,
2007a), and despite calls by educational scholars for further research in this area (e.g., Alvermann, 2008), very
little is known about how multimodal production overlaps with traditional literacy practices. Our exploratory
case study begins to fill the gap in the literature by looking at how middle school youth used Kodu (2008), a
free tile-based, animation and videogame-making tool, during an inner city summer program. It also attempts to
link the worlds  of traditional academic   literacy with   the unique  world  of   videogame   authorship through   a
constructionist environment.
         There is over 25 years of research on constructionist tools (Papert, 1969; DiSessa & Abelson, 1986;
Sykes, 2007; Resnick, Kafai & Maeda, 2003) and youth videogame making (Kafai, 1993; Habgood, Ainsworth,
& Benford, 2005; Perciles, 2007; Kelleher & Pausch, 2006; Howland, Good & Robertson, 2006; Robertson &
Howells, 2008; Burn, 2008). The videogame studies have illustrated how production has a motivational effect,
boosts self-esteem,  engages participants    in storytelling,  and  provides a gateway    into  early programming.
Additionally, the research on constructionist tools has focused on learning and teaching practices, e.g., youth
collaborative and creative processes (Peppler & Kafai, 2007a, 2007c), technology literacy and fluency (Cooper,
Dann   &  Pausch,   2003; Resnick,  Kafai    &  Maeda     2003),   media  literacy (Peppler &   Kafai, 2007b),  and
instructional approaches (Moskal, Lurie & Cooper, 2000; Rusk, Resnick, Berg & Pezalla-Granland, 2008).
Resnick  and Silverman    (2005) have also   suggested    that interactions with   programming   languages  through
!"#$%&'!%("#($%) %""*$) +,&"-(./$) 0'$/&$1) 2(%3) /4,/&(/#!/) (#) '$(#5) 6#.) 76#(,'*6%(#5) 8"&76*) $9$%/7$:) 23(!3) 769)

such sentiments (see Gee, 2003; Ito, Horst, boyd, Her-Stephenson, Lang, Pascoe & Robinson, 2008). The shape
of this transfer between subject area domains, however, has remained unexplored and unformulated.
         Tackling the issue of transfer between domains, this exploratory case study devised simple research
questions for an open and fruitful investigation of Kodu, a tile-based programming environment based on
When/Do   statements.  These    questions were:   How     did  the youth  engage   with Kodu?    And   how did  this
engagement intersect with traditional generative literacy practices?

Methods
An inner city community center in the Pacific Northwest was chosen for the study based on its geographic
accessibility, computer lab availability, compatibility of the computers with Kodu specifications, and
willingness of staff to support the program. Camp Kodu       met three days a week over three weeks   for 2.5 hours
each session for a total of 22.5 hours of Kodu exposure. The youth, who attended Camp Kodu, might best be

Kodu to build a project as they learned technology by interacting with adults and receiving feedback from peers.
They were self-selected and learned about the program through signs around the community and word of mouth
at the community center and at other institutions serving low income, urban and minority youth. In all, eleven
youth between 6th and 8th grade signed up for the class. Six of the eleven had regular attendance and were able
to complete a final project for the program. These youth emerged as the focus of the study (Patton, 2002). Of the
six core attendees, three were African American (Ky, Zeb, and Thomas), one was white (Eli), one was second
generation Chinese (Dale) and one was second generation Ethiopian (Ahmed). (All names are pseudonyms.) We
acted as participant observer as researchers and instructional support for the youth. Since the unit of analysis for

interactions between the instructor/ researcher and the youth, we felt that we could interact with students freely
as we followed their actions, but making sure not to direct their end products.

Data Gathering and Coding
Observations were recorded and tagged for four areas: acts of collaboration, problem-solving, programming
focus and storyline generation. Often tagging categories overlapped, e.g., collaboration and problem solving
might both be tagged for an observational unit. Informal interviews during observation were also common.

These exchanges were recorded, parsed by thought unit, and coded by the same system as above. Ten to twenty
minute think aloud protocols were also used as students were encouraged to talk while they composed with
Kodu. The traditional think aloud format proved difficult for the youth given their task. Consequently, cognitive
interviewing (Willis, 1999) was used to probe students in situ about why they made choices during
programming. These sessions were parsed and coded by the same system as described previously. To round out
our qualitative analysis, we analyzed t3/)9"'%3$A)567/s for code sophistication, clarity and simplicity. After the
first round of coding was completed and reviewed, the theme of audience emerged prominently in the data, and
subsequently, we added a theory driven coding structure based on HammerAs (2008) concepts of authority and
agency, as it became clear these were of growing importance to the youth. We recognized that student uptake
and use of the concepts would vary, perhaps because of the type of game they wanted to design or because of
their comfort with Kodu or programming.

Results and Analysis
The concepts of authorship proved fruitful for contextualizing our findings and illuminating the degree to which
the youth crafted games with an eye toward audience. Traditional writing research has shown that revision and

Scardamalia, 1987; Fitzgerald, 1987; Flower, Hayes, Carey, Shriver & Stratman, 1986; McCuthen, 1994, 1997).
In this respect, authorship in videogame making is similar to traditional modes of writing; however, videogame
authoring is murkier in its structure and more layered, as other New Literacies research has illustrated (see
Hammer, 2008; Knobel & Lankshear, 2008; Miller, 2005). Consequently, our frame for analysis was most

the rules, systems, and settings. They are considered the world builder who creates the sets and costumes. The
second author, according to Hammer, constructs specific fictional situations (the scripts) within a pre-
established imaginary world. The third author is the player who brings the story to life.

1st to 2nd Author
According to the above framework, the youth in Kodu occupied a space between the first and second author,
suggesting that in constructionist environments authorship is more aptly described as degrees on a spectrum,
which are influenced by the toolset established by the first author (in this case, the Kodu developers). Although
Kodu has preset characters that are controlled through a series of preset tiles, the settings produce a myriad of
environments, game genres, and character attributes. Such affordances fall more on the side of first authorship
than second, but the degree to which these affordances are utilized is influenced by the user, as well as the genre
the user is evoking. While the dynamics between what the first authors (Kodu makers) allow and what the
second author (the youth) utilize is not the focus here, it should be noted that the youth were able to still be
creative given the confines of the program by adjusting the settings of the world (gravitational pull,
environmental colors/brightness, firing speed, etc.) and the settings of the characters (movement speed, level of
springiness, etc.).
       Additionally, the youth were also creative in their use of tiles (thus pressing on their abilities to evoke
the first author through a problem scenario, not just via the tools that allowed setting changes). To demonstrate
this, I challenged the youth to create a storm within a Kodu environment.  There are no storm tiles within Kodu,
but a number of tiles in combination can make a storm-like effect. This was an exercise in bricolage. For
instance, one could clone a number of clouds that were colored gray or black and then add a yellow or orange
glow to some, along with downward aimed wisps to illustrate the act of lightening. After this request, two
students asked where to find the storm or rain tile while several others simply looked for the tile. I informed
them that such tiles did not exist, and they had to figure out how to use the tool to create the effect. One student

further and programmed the cloud to rain rocks when precipitation tiles were not found. These instances might
be considered as the youth finding the bounds of their secondary authorship in connection to the first which
constrained them to a degree.
       As Hammer (2008) defined it, authorship is partially an issue of agency. Each author has agency, but
the degree to which it is available is determined by the author above it. Unlike traditional texts which remain
fixed in form but malleable in interpretation, secondary authors have the complicated task of formulating a fluid
game-story. However, according to Hammer (2008), in order to compose they need to have various types of
agency in certain amounts. Types of agency include: textual (freedom text code), narrative (ability to create

       While in role-playing games, all these areas need to be activated in order for the secondary author to do
her job, this may not be the case in Kodu, where it is likely that these areas of agency again run along a
spectrum (as in authorship). For instance, cultural agency may not play as large a role in individual game-
making as it does in the socially bound arena of role-playing. These points aside, however, it is important to

work of Mateas (2001) and reverberates in the work of Gee (2007), who positioned it as a key component of
educating and one reason why videogames hold so much promise for learning.

2nd to 3rd Author
So this begs the question of how the youth acted as secondary authors in relation to their tertiary authors (their
audience). What affordances of agency did they allow their game players and what were their contours of
agency design?
       In the bounded domain of game genre, some of the most potent examples of second-to-third author
agency came to the foreground. The youth continually called upon a game genre on which to hang their hatsL
mostly racing and action. Although a variety of seed story games were available to the youth, they gravitated to

Left 3 Dead, a play off the zombie game genre in general, Left 4 Dead (2008) specifically. Interestingly, the
original game served as a stencil of sorts by which to formulate a story, and Eli crafted a hybridized, remixed
game (Knobel & Lankshear, 2008) using the DNA of Kodu with the game story of Left 4 Dead. Consequently,
the genre and storyline not only deeply affected what he created, but also how the game was perceived and
played by others. The general dynamics of this game were clear-cut for the player, and references to the original
were deep.

transformed to three players, hence the name change. Zoey, Bill, and Francis were all taken from the original

incorporated similar features and narrative plot lines to his game that were noticeable to his peers who were

these connections to the original game (which acted as another first author) bound the agency for the second and

       Dale used a similar strategy, designing a game around the Tower Defense genre, but he ran up against
the player and genre expectation while creating his game, demonstrating how third author agency was violated.

The exchange with the student surprised us a bit given the narrative foundation on which the student was
building his game; Tower Defense definitely had an active user. We closely observed the student as he
continued to develop the game and share it with others. At one point during the session, we had the campers

standardized writing measures and did not define himself as a game player. These two factors suggest perhaps
that during the initial stages of game development, he was connecting with more traditional, closed lines of
authorship to express himself virtually and forgetting to leave a space for the third author to move.
       These examples demonstrate how genre, knowledge of narrative history, and canonical pull impact the
agency of the second and third author. These limits are not necessarily bad things, as stated earlier, since they
serve as a function of coherency. As Nickerson suggested (1999) participants within an environment need
structure in order to support their actions. However, it is when a second author limits the agency of the third in
an unexpected way we see conflict. Participant agency is a balance between being bound and having freedom,
which is not necessarily located in the powers of characters, but through them. This allows the third author to
feel as if they have freedom without a sense of anomie. This idea is also reflected in game authoring literature.

general, they constantly pedaled between the Kodu program interface and the experience they were trying to
create for the user. At first this act was the perpetual testing of the code without much thought about the
playerLperhaps acting as testers versus players. During the second of half of camp, however, and with more
time devoted to sharing work, the youth became more interested in how and to what success their game was
being played. For example, Ky was particularly attuned to audience and at first took pride in the fact that no one
could win his game. With time and player feedback, however, he adjusted code to make the experience player
friendly. He did this so much so that he would adjust the code and settings of his game depending on which

of creativity that was elicited from the storm-prompt. As an example, he used a programming feature
(reloading) in a way that it was not explicitly intended. Additionally, his code offered a myriad of actions for the
user through the game controller (some might think overuse), signaling his reaching out to the third author.
First, he gave the player the ability to communicate status information (reloading) to the other two players in the
game, as well as express emotions through text (DIE!!!). Interestingly, he also automated the calling of another
character within the game (e>5>B)+N(**WWW:) perhaps launching the story into narrative action. This may be
considered an attribute assigned to user experience (the affect of the game) over third author agency (the ability
to move within the game) since the player was not in control of this feature.

importance as a game-play element. Thomas, for instance, spent several class sessions developing a racing game
in which the landscape consisted of jagged mountains with steep valleys, but the landscape the path rested on
was too extreme for his players to navigate without falling off and getting stuck. This was a real drag on agency
for both characters, one of which was controlled by the player and other of which was automated. During one

thoughts. The creation of this element took forethought about potential users and how they may be feeling
during game play. Ky established a dramatic stage on which the game-narrative played out, giving the third
author the agency to rest and decide actions.

youth moved from being particularly unforgiving in the virility of their antagonists to developing allies to assist
the player in the world. Zeb, for instance, went from making a game in which the player was blown away within
the first few seconds of play to distributing the antagonists along a linear path that supplied the player with a
more refined experience and actual agency to survive within the world for an extended period of time. Ky also
introduced a character, the last surviving flying fish, to assist the user during play by attacking the flying fish
that had turned into zombies. And finally, Ahmed created a deep structure of alliances and enemies that
afforded help and constraint on play. He strategically positioned them on the terrain and in the air to make the

       Although these illustrations are partly attributed to building an interesting story for the third author,
they are also related to giving the characters and objects in the field of play agency either by adjusting behaviors

In this case, Ahmed was anticipating his playersA needs within the drama of the game. Satisfying the desire of an
unknown player is a complex task in game making, where the interactions between the characters, the characters
and landscape, and characters and user all need to be taken into account. The shifting of perspectives the youth
underwent in the development of their games was complex. Considering character and participant agency was a

key component in the making of a plot that was driven by character behaviors and landscape constraints and
affordances, and not traditional plot lines. Since this compositional task was so complex, one is left to wonder
how these strategies related (or not) with traditional academic domains, particularly writing. How is authorship
with an Xbox controller and Kodu different from a pencil and paper or keyboard and screen? Despite obvious
differences, there may be conceptual, complementary compositional underpinnings.

Discussion and Educational Implications
Many educational researchers have presented descriptions on youth who are disengaged with learning
traditional language arts curriculum but motivated by informal new literacy practices like videogames
(Goodman, 2003; McGinnis, 2007; Ranker, 2008; Sarroub, Pernicek & Sweeney, 2007). Outside these
depictions of the motivating and identity forming effects of New Literacies, however, there is little data on how
engagement with various media domains intersects with what is defined as academic literacy.
   Often times, traditional and New Literacies are considered +.'/*(#5).($!"'&$/$: (Alvermann, 2008), but in
truth, while digital compositional spaces are unique, they also intersect with the goals of traditional writing
instruction. Consider how the findings of Camp Kodu are connected to traditional literacy. Students crafted
game-worlds in which they scripted character and player behaviors, motivations, weaknesses and strengths.
They also produced settings that positively and negatively influenced character and player actions, and plot arcs
were highly influenced by how the characters, players and settings were coded and designed. Additionally, the
youth engaged and seemingly learned from the expectations associated with a genre and narrative plots,
sometimes transforming both in interesting ways, much in the same vein as literary canons are built over time.
They were also cognizant of audience expectations and afforded their users with agency through various
controls of movement and expression. The students also demonstrated the importance of setting not just for
mood and tone, but also as a space for user constraint and assistance. They developed characters that were
(#%/&!"##/!%/.)6#.)(#8*'/#!/.)/6!3)"%3/&A$);/36-("&$, and they continually inhabited the roles of author, users,
and characters in order to create game-worlds that were appealing to an audience. Finally, the students
constantly revised game text according to perceived audience wants and skill levels.
   Centrality of audience, the roll of revision, and posit("#(#5)"#/A$)6'%3"&$3(,)2/&/)/$$/#%(6* %")%3/)$%'./#%$A)
creations and were motivated by the very academic goal of gaining and sustaining the attention of readers and
viewers over time. During this authorship, the complex ways youth process information was largely implicit in
the activity of game making. This processing overlaps with various literacy domains perhaps signaling a
conceptual move away from learning as an explicit collection of knowledge to be acquired for mastery and a
movement toward a framework based on the connections between knowledge, skills, and practices across
authored spaced. Such a shift operates, according to Knobel and Lankshear (2008), on the vast and broad plane
"8)/#!".(#5B)#"%)+*/%%/&6!9B:)6$)*(%/&6!9)($)"8%/#),*69/.)"'%)(#)$!3""*$B)6#.)(%),resses on idea of transliteracy
(Thomas, Joseph, Laccetti, Mason, Mills & Perril, 2007).
   Interestingly, learning transfer, as outlined by Schwartz, Bransford, & Sears (2005) suggested that multiple
contexts and exposures to tasks underlie these implicit learning concepts. Extending their theories and findings
to New Literacies and to programs like Kodu, it might be argued that compositional practices and skills are
enriched by authoring in multiple modes of communicationLgenerating an adaptive, compositional expertise
that operates to some degree successfully across domains. For instance, by learning how composition operates
across modes of communication, youth may build upon, learn new, and leave behind composing strategies as
they discern what compositionally works from what does not across domains.
   Consequently, future research in videogame making with Kodu might further unpack the relationship
between authoring videogames and student reading and writing in traditional areas, looking at what transfers in
and out of the practices associated these generative/creative activities across various modes and genres. Cross
domain studies are needed in literacy education, and they suggest that videogame making through
constructionist tools have merit outside of just teaching youth early programming concepts. As this small study
itself demonstrated, students enlisted compositional strategies that were unique to game making, but also
broadly related to authoring across compositional areas. Of course, dynamics of agency with Kodu seem
uniquely situated in game making, though perhaps not without import to other compositional practices.
