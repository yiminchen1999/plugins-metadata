        A bstract: There are ongoing divisions in the learning sciences between perspectives that treat
        cognition as occurring within individual minds and those that treat it as irreducibly distributed or
        situated in material and social contexts. We contend that accounts of individual minds as complex
        systems are theoretically continuous with distributed and situated cognition.       On this view, the
        difference is a matter of the scale of the dynamics of interest, and the choice of scale can be
        informed by data.   In this paper, we propose heuristics for empirically determining the scale of the
        relevant cognitive dynamics.   We illustrate these heuristics in two contrasting cases, one in which
        the evidence supports attributing cognition to a group of students and one in which the evidence
        supports attributing cognition to an individual.

perspective takes the individual as the unit of theoretical and empirical focus, under the assumption that cognition is
something that only brains do.  While cognitivists do not ignore the social and material contexts in which cognition
takes place, they analyze cognition by decomposing it into the information processing of individuals (Anderson,
Reder, & Simon, 1997). That stance contrasts with situated and distributed views, which contend that cognitive
processes cannot be neatly attributed to contributions of individuals when they interact with each other and their
environment.  Arguments for    situated cognition often cite the example of a dieter solving the problem of taking three
quarters of half a cup of cottage cheese by pouring out half a cup of cottage cheese, cutting it into fours, and
removing one quarter (Lave, Murtaugh, & De La Rocha, 1984). A paradigmatic example of distributed cognition
describes the information processing within an airplane cockpit   to show that it is the cockpit as a whole:the people

        There have been a number of arguments regarding the relationship between these perspectives.            Cobb

review an argument for theoretical continuity among these perspectives, by which they represent different scales of a
complex system, rather than as fundamentally different approaches.     Rather than consider the choice of perspective a
matter of a priori theoretical commitments, we propose treating that choice as empirical.     We offer heuristics for
matching the choice of unit of analysis to the dynamics evident in the data, arguing that the cognitive unit can be
modeled at the grain size(s) at which there are observable stabilities and coherent dynamics in cognitive activity. We
then illustrate the use of these heuristics with two example analyses demonstrating empirical evidence for group and
individual cognitive units, respectively.

commitments.
         Consistent   with  the  views  of  cognition as  situated and   distributed, there   are behaviors  and  cognitive
dynamics that can emerge out of the interaction of multiple individuals and artifacts.       Great strides have been made
in the last quarter  century   in modeling   how   complex    behaviors  can  emerge   from   interacting  agents following
surprisingly simple   sets of  rules.  Paradigmatic   examples   include  flocking   birds  (Kennedy   &   Eberhart,  1995),
synchronized flashes of fireflies (Mirollo & Strogatz, 1990), and foraging of ant colonies (Dorigo & Stützle, 2004).
Thelen and Smith (1994; Smith, 2005) have argued for complex systems-based models of cognitive development in
individuals, again taking a mind to be made up of many interacting parts in dynamic interaction with each other.
         Meanwhile,     social science  has  advanced   a  variety of   accounts   of  interactive   dynamics,   such  as in
conversations tending to abide by simple rules (Grice, 1989) and in shared interpretive frameworks (Goffman, 1974)
that are maintained   explicitly  and   implicitly by attending   to  and responding     to  verbal, facial  and  behavioral
metamessages (Bateson, 1985; Tannen, 1993).         These too may be understood as complex systems, at this larger

model the dynamics of cognition via the synchronized activity of many cognitive resources, whether those resources
are within an individual mind or distributed across minds and materials.

What to look for: Heuristics for Data-Based Choice of Unit of Cognition
On this view, rather than as a priori commitment, the scale of the relevant dynamics may be determined by the
evidence at hand.    Our core purpose here is to propose four heuristics for making that determination: clustering,
persistence, resistance, and transition.    We extracted these from a range of recent work dealing with a variety of
dynamics    relevant to cognition  including  conceptions,    behaviors,  framing,   and    epistemologies  (Conlin,  Gupta,
Scherr, & Hammer; Frank, Kanim, & Gomez, 2008; Scherr & Hammer, 2009).                      The heuristics are not a coding
scheme, but rather a guide for empirically grounding the choice of the unit of analysis.      In what follows we describe
the heuristics and then apply them to two specific examples to show how they can do work in finding an appropriate
unit of analysis for modeling cognition.

Clustering

simultaneous    activation of  multiple elements   in the  same   domain   or across  domains.       For example,  how    we
recognize someone as greeting us is by the clustering of behavioral and speech patterns such as a hand extended for
hand-shake, a smile on the face, an elevated vocal pitch, and the utterance of socially-accepted greeting words such

clusters of  various  kinds   of  behaviors (e.g., facial expressions,   gestures,   pitch, posture) that  tended to   occur
synchronously within and across students working on physics worksheets in groups of four.

Persistence
If clusters are to be suggestive of cognitive stabilities then they need to be more than just fleeting happenstance; they
should persist over time.   In the case of a hand-shake the behaviors might persist for a few seconds, while in other
cases  clusters could remain    stable over much   larger time  scale.   For  example,   while watching    a thriller movie,
behaviors such as stiff posture, intense gaze on the screen, and low perceptivity of the environment could form a
cluster that persists over several minutes.  In (Scherr & Hammer, 2009) stable clusters of behaviors were found to
last from as little as a few seconds up to several uninterrupted minutes.

Resistance to Change
In general, the stability of the state of a system is inferred in its ability to sustain itself in the face of perturbations.
In certain moments, minor changes in the makeup of the cluster (whether the unit is the individual or the group)
could challenge the coherence of physical and cognitive activity.         Still, the clusters characterizing  the cognitive

coherence may be so stable that they can persist despite the perturbation/disturbance.       Think of a greeting that lacks
an important element, say, when one person extends a hand but the other person does not shake it.            This can be a

activities. Fine-grained  analysis   of the   phenomenon      can   illuminate how   particular clusters react to   naturally
occurring perturbations, providing evidence on the stability and transition dynamics of clusters.        More importantly,
such analysis can provide empirical insight into whether the cluster (of resources, behaviors, etc.) in that moment is
stabilized by an individual or a group.

Transitions
Sudden transitions in behavior help mark the spatial and temporal boundaries of the stabilities.        If there are multiple
stable states in the cognitive dynamics of an individual or a group, then we should be able to see distinct transitions
amongst the stable states.    For this reason it is often easier to notice changes in clusters than to notice the stable
clusters themselves:when        something  suddenly  changes     it highlights  what was   just a local  stability.  When  a
greeting is over, all of the behaviors that are characteristic of greetings end at about the same time, possibly turning
into another cluster corresponding to, say, a conversation.
         For an empirical example, the behavioral clusters of Scherr and Hammer (2009) were found only after
noticing distinct transitions in behavior.    That there were noticeable transitions led the researchers to find and clarify
what the transitions were from and to, which upon further analysis were found to be coherent clusters of behaviors.
The behavioral transitions are easily and reliably identified: before discussion three independent coders agreed on
the timing of 90% behavioral transitions (to within five sec.+,#L?( ( 8%$+#-0-.+#( $%"( .;0"+( 0'"( %"#2<0( .;( 3*-,#7D( -?"?(
minor changes in the clusters of behaviors.      Bids that do not precipitate a transition to a new behavior cluster are
evidence    of the stability of the  cluster.  Bids that lead    to a marked   transition between  stable clusters   are also
evidence of the coherence of those clusters.
  In the examples that follow we will report on the clustering, resistance, and transitions of phenomena at the
individual level and at the group level.   We attend to the studen0#@(='B#-&$<(*"'$)-.%(H9"#02%"D(9$T"D(=.#02%"D("0&?L($#(
well as the substance of their discourse in applying these heuristics.

Data Analysis
Our data    is from an   introductory  algebra-based  introductory    physics   course at a large  public university.    The
students are   mostly  third-year life sciences  majors.   We draw our observations from video taken during tutorial
sessions S 50-minute sessions, facilitated by teaching assistants, in which the students work in groups of four on
ungraded guided-inquiry worksheets focusing on conceptual and epistemological development in physics.
         First, we present an example of group-level dynamics in behavior and epistemological framing, that is a

show how the evidence of clustering, persistence over time, resistance to change, and spontaneous transitions all
support  this  account in  terms  of group-level  stabilities and   dynamics.    We then present a second example that
supports an individual unit of analysis but not group-level cognition, in order to show a contrasting case of the scale
of the unit of analysis.
         More typically, we expect, the relevant scale may shift over the course of an episode, and we expect that
analyzing those dynamics will be a fruitful direction for further analyses.      For the present, we focus on articulating

Clustering of Behavior and Reasoning: Group as Unit
As students go through the tutorial, multiple elements of their behaviors S gaze, body posture, extent of gestures,
and tone of voice S are coordinated or clustered in particular patterns.      Scherr and Hammer (2009) identified four

spent in tutorial (Conlin, Gupta, R. E Scherr, & D. Hammer, 2007)          We will only mention the two clusters that are
relevant here, blue and green.

                  (a)                                            (b)

                                     students exhibiting the "green" cluster.

In the first segment of the episode, the group is exhibiting the blue behavioral cluster (see Figure 1a) -characterized
by downward gaze, hands writing or resting on the table, scant and mostly deictic gesturing, low or flat voices, and
intermittent speech   with no  overlap.  In the second       segment,  the students transition as a   group to the green
behavioral cluster (Figure1b), in which they tend to make eye contact, sit up, gesture, and speak in animated voices
with overlapping speech.   The arrows in Figure 1 show how the gaze of the students is coordinated S and the locus
of their gaze shifts in synchronous patterns making it meaningful to talk about the group as gazing towards the
worksheet during the earlier segment and towards one another during the second segment.
         These behavioral clusters also often indicate locally stable ways in which the students were framing the
activity, either as completing the worksheet or as having a discussion (Scherr & Hammer, 2009).             At first, their
speech is in the service of finding the answer to the worksheet question.      Amanda, Dianne, and Bridget all but say

emotional outburst of Dianna cued them to think about and communicate their personal opinions, leading to a
cascade of utterances towards mechanistic pursuit of the phenomenon.          The coordinated nature of the transition in
behavior (from blue cluster to the green cluster) and framing (from doing the worksheet to having a discussion)
makes it appropriate to think about the group as transitioning rather than four individuals separately making these
transitions. This supports the theoretical coupling of framing and behavior, since    behaviors act as the  metamessages

illustrates the stability of the cluster and its extension beyond single individuals.

Persistence of Behavior and Reasoning: Group as Unit
Additional evidence for the group being the appropriate unit of analysis here comes from examining what keeps the
behavior  or framing   stable during   these   segments.   We   find  that  the  behaviors     serving   as  meta-messages
communicating the fine-grained stances students are taking in their utterances.         When a student makes animated
gestures or talks loudly, it sends the message of a discussion or argument in contrast to hunching over your personal
worksheet.   Seeing one member clarifying an idea might prompt a second student to add to it, which supports and
encourages the effort of the first creating feedback loops that help in the persistence of the  activity.   The moment-to-
moment    behaviors and  utterances  establish a shared  understanding   of  the    nature  of the  activity S that is self-
sustaining.  Before the  transition, individual  behaviors such   as hunching   over   the  worksheet,    exchanging   short
vocabulary  or quick  questions in   low voices, reinforces   the 12$%34*' shared     sense of  the activity  of filling the
worksheet; and later, after the transition, their pursuit of a mechanistic explanation of what happens in the collision
is built out of bits of contribution from the different members.   In either segment, the persistence of behaviors and
reasoning is a group endeavor, even though individuals are enacting these behaviors and utterances.

The Individual as a Unit of Analysis
The second exampleii comes from a tutorial on shadows and light.        In this tutorial, students try to build a model of
light by exploring the patterns and motions of light created by a light bulb and an aperture.           The question being

                 Veronica:       Mmm, not really.
                 Jan:            You sure?

                 Veronica:       It is physics-oriented, that's just the way it is.
                 Jan:            Okay.

Clustering of Behavior and Reasoning: Individuals as Unit
Throughout the conversation presented as well as before and after it, Veronica is sitting up, looking at the other
group members, speaking in a loud, animated tone, and gesturing (Fig 2).       Jan, who is sitting across the table from
Veronica,   for large parts  of the tutorial, is hunched  over,  and  drawing  on the tutorial worksheet.   During      the
moments of the conversation above, she does look up at Veronica and speak in a clear and loud voice, but these
were fleeting   moments.     The  larger pattern  was  of   students conducting   themselves differently. This     lack of
synchronicity and coordination among the behaviors suggests a clustering at the individual level in this case, not at
the group level.

                          Figure 2. Veronica is gesturing as Jan is writing on her worksheet.

          Again, the contrasting behaviors indicate that Jan and Veronica are framing the activity differently, also
evidenced by their very different epistemological stances.    Veronica is appealing to her intuitive sense of mechanism

Persistence and Resistance of Behaviors and Reasoning: Individuals as Unit
Both Veronica and Jan activate a stable set of epistemological resources throughout this clip.       In fact, this stability

is relatively stable and robust throughout the semester.

agree to disagree, persisting in their epistemological framing despite the explicit bids made to change them.

Transition in Behaviors and Reasoning: Individuals as Unit
Just as there is no coherent clustering at the group level, there are no clear transitions at the group level between
clusters. This seems to be the exception rather than the norm, since most of the time groups spend in tutorial is in
one of four behavioral clusters separated by sharp transitions (Scherr & Hammer, 2009).        This counts as evidence
against the group being the unit of cognitive analysis during this clip.       This lack of group    transitions, taken in
conjunction with the other heuristics above, constitutes a strong empirical case for taking the individual as the unit
of analysis here.

Conclusions
Our argument is two-tiered.     On one tier, we analyze the behavior and discourse within two episodes of student
group work in introductory physics tutorials.     We found evidence for stabilities and dynamics of cognition at the
group level and the individual level, using four empirical heuristics for identifying the scale of the cognitive unit.
In the first example we demonstrated that the clustering, persistence, resistance, and transition reflect dynamics at
the level of the group as a whole.  It is the collective group frame that enables them to reason about the mechanisms
involved  in a  collision in a  more sophisticated  way.     In the second  example  we  demonstrated   how clustering,

stances and their conceptual understanding of how light travels.          Veronica and Jan held different views not only of

       One tier up, we are arguing that these analyses demonstrate how the choice of cognitive unit can be made
empirically by attending to the dynamics and stabilities evident in the data.       This is in contrast to the positions on
both sides of the ongoing debate about the unit of analysis, with cognitivist and situativists basing their decision
largely on theoretical considerations. We introduced four empirical heuristics for identifying the scale of cognitive
dynamics.   Our analyses of the two     episodes highlight   the utility     and generativity of our empirical heuristics,
although we do no claim that these span the set of evidentiary supports for determining the cognitive unit.       All of
this is underwritten by the resources and framing model of mind, since resources can be distributed within an
individual mind  or across  several    individuals and    artifacts.       Hopefully our approach    will enable greater
communication and collaboration between cognitivists and those who model cognition as situated and/or distributed.
