Introduction
This  study    examines   how   two   different types    of experimentation      goals led  students   toward   different
investigation strategies and insights about a complex science problem. We designed Airbags: Too F ast, Too
F ur ious?,  a week-long   inquiry   module   for  high  school   physics    classes that guides students    through   an
investigation about car collisions. In Airbags, students conduct experiments using a visualization to investigate

choices and explanations to provide detailed information about their inquiry activities and inferences. This study
examines two main research questions: (1) What is the overall impact of Airbags ."'01*&!"103'$9(/(1,'1o interpret
and construct motion graphs? and (2) How does prompting students to compare, rather than isolate, variables in
their experiments guide students toward different experimentation strategies and insights?

Rationale
Early research   on  scientific  reasoning   addressed   %#(/&+!"30  ability  to isolate  variables in   knowledge-lean
experimentation contexts. For instance, Inhelder and Piaget (1958) designed a task [later adapted by Kuhn and
Phelps (1982)] that asked subjects to determine what combination of colorless fluids would yield a specific
reaction outcome. Siegler and Liebert (1975) examined the ways subjects determined how an electric train runs
on the basis of four binary switches (though in actuality, a researcher operated the train using a secret switch to
ensure that subjects would test all 16 combinations). These studies examined experimentation as domain-general
logical inference, as subjects had no information on which to base testable hypotheses. In these situations,
subjects could make valid inferences only by isolating variables to logically eliminate possibilities.
          Over time, research has increasingly examined knowledge-rich contexts and revealed the important
role of context-specific knowledge in experimentation. For example, studies show that children are more likely
to test plausible rather than implausible hypotheses (Klahr, Fay, and Dunbar, 1993), focus on variables they
believe to be causal (Kanari & Millar, 2004), and use experiments to achieve specific outcomes rather than test

invalid experimental designs or inferences, students may also use ideas productively, such as by narrowing the

real-life goals  of reproducing     positive results  (good     cakes)   and eliminating  negative  ones   (bad  cakes).
Koslowski (1996) also argued that using prior knowledge to generate and interpret evidence is a good strategy,
particularly when understanding mechanisms informs the interpretation of outcomes.
          In   Airbags, students rely   on many   types  of  context-0=!%(6(%' (&!$0' 1.' &+$4' %."%/*0(."0:' ?1*&!"103'
everyday understanding of motion, their physics domain knowledge about motion graphs, and evidence from the
World-Wide Web all contribute to the way students design and interpret their experiments. Our previous work
on Airbags (McElhaney & Linn, 2008) compared students who were constrained to conduct a specific number
of trials to   unconstrained students.  During  planning,   constrained    students  attended more    to the logistics of
isolating variables, resulting in more controlled trials than unconstrained students. Unconstrained students, who
attended more to the relationships among collision factors, variables, and outcomes, demonstrated a superior
understanding   of  the  situation. This result suggests    that incorporating   a context-specific understanding  into

to achieve positive outcomes than negative ones (Tschirgi, 1980) or when learners use different approaches for
optimization than for rule-generation (Schauble, Klopfer, & Raghavan, 1991). This study draws from research
in science instruction showing that comparisons can highlight key features of variables (Clement, 1983; Linn,
2005; Schwartz & Bransford, 1998) and investigates whether goals that encourage students to compare variables
promote different insights about Airbags than goals that encourage students to isolate variables.
        This study also explores how students come to understand thresholds (values of a particular variable
above or below which the outcome is independent of the other variables). The presence of thresholds requires
students to consider factors other than covariation to achieve a complete understanding of Airbags. Though
students may readily observe the effects of thresholds by isolating variables, we hypothesized that comparing
variables would highlight the distinct characteristics of each variable, helping sophisticated learners achieve a
more nuanced understanding of Airbags based on thresholds as well as covariation. We also expected that the
more familiar and tractable task of isolating variables would be more beneficial for less sophisticated learners.

Methods

Module and visualization design
We designed Airbags (Figure 1a), using the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (Linn, Davis, & Bell,

        Students may use two types of inferences to explain their findings: covariation and threshold values.
First, over a particular range of values, each of the three variables covaries with the time that elapses before the
driver and airbag collide. Tall drivers, low speed collisions, and a large crumple zone therefore make a driver
more likely to encounter a fully inflated airbag than short drivers, high speed collisions, and a small crumple
zone. Second, two threshold values (for position and time) determine situations where the likelihood of injury is

airbag, and (2) for sufficiently tall drivers, if the duration of the crumple zone exceeds the deployment time for
the airbag, drivers will always encounter a fully inflated airbag. Responses to embedded assessments indicate
whether students attribute their findings to covariation and/or thresholds.

Study design
Groups in the isolate and compare conditions received investigation questions that encouraged them to isolate or
compare variables, respectively. Except for the investigation questions, the modules used for each condition

were identical. We used a pretest/posttest experimental design with embedded assessments and two comparison
conditions. We  randomly   assigned student  groups    to   one of the   conditions using   a stratified approach  to
distribute their ability equally across the two conditions. To keep instruction similar across conditions, teachers
and researchers focused class discussions on graph interpretations rather than on investigation questions and
refrained from guiding individual students on designing experiments.

Participants
Physics  students (N=166)  at five socially diverse   high  schools   in the United  States   studied Airbags.  Most
students worked in dyads on the module (unpaired students worked alone). Students were usually grouped with
other students of nearly equal ability. Most teachers had taught the topic using previous versions of Airbags.

Data sources and scoring

Pretests and posttests
Ten constructed response pretest and posttest items assessed students3'$9(/(1,'1.'interpret and construct graphs of
one-dimensional motion in a context outside of Airbags. We administered pretests individually to students the
day before the beginning of Airbags and posttests within a few days of completion. We scored pretest and
posttest responses from zero to four using knowledge integration rubrics (Linn, Lee, Tinker, Husic, & Chiu,
2006) that measured how well students connected characteristics of motion to the features of motion graphs.

comparison between successive trials using the variable appropriate to the chosen investigation question. We
used only trials that specified one of the three investigation questions (i.e. not Just exploring) for this score. This
proportion score indicates the extent to which students mindfully used CVS to investigate the three questions.
         Interpreting and constructing Airbags graphs. Twelve items asked students to interpret motion graphs
from  the visualization or generate  graphs  that    represented   a  collision situation.  Each group    received   a
COLLISION GRAPHS score that captured how well they connected characteristics of the graphs to the events
in a collision. We scored these explanations from zero to five using knowledge integration rubrics.
         Understanding of covariation and thresholds. Three items prompted students to explain their answers
to the three investigation questions listed in Table 1. We used these responses to determine whether each group
attained a covariation-based and/or thresholds-based understanding of the Airbags situation. To examine how
frequently students attributed their findings to covariation, we counted the number of responses by each group
that described covariation between   the factor or    variable  in question   and   elapsed time  before   the driver
encounters the airbag. To examine how frequently students attributed their findings to thresholds, we counted
the number of responses by each group that used at least one of the thresholds in support of their finding.

Videorecords
We videorecorded 12 dyads as they engaged in the experimentation activity, so that we could closely examine
the discussions that occurred during experimentation within specific dyads. We chose two of these dyads for a
case comparison to illustrate how the investigation questions they received influenced their experimentation
strategies and insights. A more detailed description of these two dyads and the reasons we chose them for
analysis follows the presentation of the results of the comparison study.

Results

Impact of Airbags !"#$%&'("%$)#&"'(*$%+"',"-#!.#/!%,!"#-*+01$
Students made moderate, significant pretest-posttest gains [M = 29.99, SD = 6.66 (pre); M = 32.76, SD = 5.96
(post), t(128) = 5.17, p < .001 (two-tailed), d = 0.44]. Gains were positive for all five schools, and significant for
four of the schools. Low prior knowledge learners made the greatest gains. The gains indicate that Airbags was
successful   in helping   diverse   learners  interpret and     construct motion  graphs.  The  gains  are    impressive
considering   that all students   had completed    a  kinematics    unit  shortly before   studying  Airbags,  and they
represent value added to a traditionally taught kinematics unit.
          The difference in posttest scores between the two conditions was not significant. We did not expect
differences because the experimentation activity generally comprised just 10-20% of the total time spent on
Airbags. Students in both conditions therefore had many opportunities to improve their graphing knowledge
other than by experimentation. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the conditions on the
COLLISION       GRAPHS      scores, suggesting   that the   isolate and   compare  prompts   were  equally  effective in
helping students connect the characteristics of the Airbags graphs to the collision events.

CVS scores showed that the high tertile groups conducted a significantly higher proportion of controlled trials
than the low and middle tertile groups [M = .79, SD = .30 (high), M = .45, SD = .35 (low/middle), t(79) = 4.39,
p < .001   (two-tailed)]. This  difference   suggests   that high   prior knowledge   students as  a whole    were more
focused on controlling variables in their investigations.
          Overall, about 30% of the students generated covariation-based explanations of the collision events.
The percentage was somewhat higher for the high (38%) and middle (36%) tertile groups than for the low (19%)
tertile groups,  but this difference  was    not  significant,  indicating that a covariation-based  understanding    of
Airbags was accessible to students at all prior knowledge levels. However, just 2% of low and middle tertile
students generated thresholds-based explanations, compared to 31% of the high tertile students. A Wilcoxon
rank-sum test showed that the difference in the average number of thresholds-based explanations was significant
[M = .59, SD = .98 (high), M = .038, SD = .28 (low/middle), U = 3.78, p < .001]. This result suggests that only
sophisticated learners were able to achieve a thresholds-based understanding of Airbags.

CVS scores showed significant differences between the conditions only for the high tertile students [M = .94,
SD = .06 (isolate), M = .70, SD = .35 (compare), t(27) = 2.22, p = .035 (two-tailed)]. A close examination of
these   data revealed  that while   virtually all the   isolate groups    devoted nearly all their  trials to controlled
comparisons between successive trials, one-third of the compare groups used at least half their trials for other
strategies. (The case comparison that follows will illustrate some of these strategies.) This result suggests that
though most students used similar approaches to investigate the isolate and compare questions, the compare
questions led some high prior knowledge students to use alternative strategies to CVS in their investigations.
          There were no differences in the number of covariation-based explanations between the two conditions,
indicating both conditions were equally effective in leading students toward a covariation-based understanding
of Airbags. However, we observed significant differences in the number of thresholds-based explanations for
the high tertile students. Just 8% of the high tertile isolate groups generated thresholds-based explanations,
compared to 44% of the compare groups. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that the difference in the average
number of thresholds-based explanations for high tertile students was significant [M = .091, SD = .30 (isolate),
M = .89, SD = 1.13 (compare), U = 2.09, p = .037]. This finding suggests that the compare questions promoted
a thresholds-based understanding of Airbags, though this difference occurred only with sophisticated learners.

Case comparison
We use a case comparison to illustrate some ways the isolate and compare tasks might have led sophisticated
students toward different experiences with the Airbags visualization. We chose two similar high-tertile dyads for
a case comparison. The students in these dyads were enrolled in the same honors physics curriculum with the
same    teacher and  had  similar   pretest and  posttest scores.   Furthermore,  all four students  were   concurrently
enrolled in calculus and thus had strong mathematics skills. Because the student population and array of schools

Airbags. These cases rather aim to illustrate how the compare questions might have prompted sophisticated
students to consider aspects of the Airbags situation that the more traditional isolate question might not have.

Case 1: Brett and Eric (isolate condition)

Overview
Brett and Eric (pseudonyms) studied the isolate version of Airbags. They conducted 10 total trials. For their first
four trials, they chose Just exploring as their goal, during which time they explored outcomes for default and
extreme values of all three variables. They devoted the last six trials to conducting a pair of controlled trials for
each of the three investigation questions. Their experimentation session lasted about 10 minutes. This analysis
focuses on the three controlled trial pairs.

Trials 5 & 6!"#$%&'"()*+(",)"-%"'./%0")-1*)2'345
In trials 5 and 6, Eric and Brett investigated whether tall or short drivers are more at risk. In trial 5, they
examined the outcome for a short person. The following excerpt illustrates their variable choices for trial 6 and
their interpretation of the two trials:

were prohibited from using other        strategies (though   at no point   does Airbags   suggest how  students    should

By this time, Eric was no longer attending to the nature of the variables and appears to have sequestered their

experimentation strategy from their understanding of the Airbags context. At this point, the variables might as
well have been X, Y, and Z rather than position, velocity, and time.

Case 2: Joann and Linda (compare condition)

Overview
Joann and Linda (pseudonyms) studied the compare version of Airbags. They began their experimentation by
carrying out an initial plan to isolate each variable. They quickly abandoned that approach and employed other
strategies such as testing extreme values and incrementally varying individual variables. Their experimentation
session lasted about 30 minutes. This analysis will focus on three excerpts that illustrate the evolution of their
investigation strategies and the insights they achieved by using these diverse approaches.

Trials 1 - 4: Abandoning CVS
Joann and Linda used their first three trials to isolate the position variable and test its full range. As they decided
on the values for the fourth trial, Linda began to reconsider their approach.

crumpling empowered them to abandon their initial strategy:
    (82)      J:  Then it all falls back to what we said originally, the crash, the speed of the crash

that the isolate questions, by their very nature, were unlikely to promote. The discussion about effects appears at
least in part to have led Linda and Joann to abandon their initial approach. Unlike Brett and Eric, they had

question. At this point, they took a different approach toward making sense of the Airbags situation.

Trials 5 - 7: Exploring extreme values
In trials 5, 6, and 7, Joann and Linda explored extreme values of the velocity and time variables. In trial 5 they

sequence culminated in an important observation Joann made as they examined trials 6 and 7:

Again, only the compare questions would prompt Joann make this insight about how much the proximity to the

the outcome may depend on the value of position. Though this initial understanding of the interaction between
position and  time   was    at this  point incomplete,   it became   increasingly   sophisticated through     continued
experimentation and discussion, eventually leading to a highly nuanced understanding of the threshold values.

Trials 8 - 11: Incremental variation
Beginning  with   trial 8,  Joann   and Linda  changed   approaches  once   more  to examine  the  effects    of minute
changes to the variables. From trial 8 to trial 9, they decreased the time by the smallest possible increment. After
not finding anything conclusive, they incrementally adjusted the velocity in trial 10. Comparing trials 9 and 10
revealed to them nearly identical graphs and led to the following exchange:

Observing the similarity between the trial 9 and trial 10 graphs made them realize for the first time that their
initial hypothesis (that speed would have the largest effect) was incorrect. Joann was almost able to explain
why, but could not quite articulate the    precise reason   for the    insensitivity of the outcome to    the velocity.
However, using trial 11 to retest the situation once more with the highest allowable velocity value crystallized
their understanding of the time threshold:

Discussion
Airbags benefited learners across the distribution of prior knowledge, albeit in different ways. Learners with
initially poor understanding of motion graphs made large gains in their abilities to interpret and construct motion
graphs, and they were able to generalize their knowledge from Airbags to other motion contexts. However, these

investigate the questions systematically and reach meaningful insights. On the other hand, learners with initially
strong understanding of motion graphs had less room for improvement in that area, but conducted experiments
that led to more valid inferences. In particular, the compare questions helped the most sophisticated learners
examine key distinctions between the variables, such as the magnitudes of the effects of each variable on the
outcome.
       The  stark differences between      the two cases    illustrate how the isolate   and  compare  questions   led
students to reason about the Airbags situation. For Brett and Eric, the isolate questions appeared to provoke a

school science), and as a result they limited themselves to a predetermined pattern of using CVS rather than
spontaneously employing diverse strategies to investigate new questions. They prioritized validly implementing
CVS over gaining insight. They sequestered their understanding of the Airbags situation from their investigation
strategy and, more generally, from their conceptions of the Airbags task and the real life practice of science.

especially informative. Their analysis did not go beyond a superficial characterization of the variables.
       In contrast, the compare questions prompted Joann and Linda to incorporate a wider range of strategies
to elucidate variation patterns. They conducted trials intending to understand the relationships between variables
and outcomes and the mechanisms that governed these relationships. Though their initial efforts to use CVS did
not yield useful ideas, in the end they spontaneously used CVS to achieve a nuanced understanding of Airbags
by building on ideas they refined using other strategies. ["' 1#(0' 4$,@' a.$""30' $"&' Y("&$30' *0!' .6' WX?' &*+("2'
their final four trials evolved naturalistically as a way to investigate questions that arose from their previous
trials. The compare questions encouraged Joann and Linda to deeply consider the nature of the variables and to
make important and meaningful distinctions between them.

conditions only for high prior knowledge students. Joann and Linda needed highly sophisticated knowledge of
experimentation strategies and graph interpretation in order to reach their advanced level of understanding. Less
sophisticated students likely lacked sufficient knowledge either to distinguish the compare questions from the
isolate questions or to adequately investigate either type of question. Future research will examine how to refine
the guidance to help more typical students conduct informative experiments.

Conclusions and Implications
This study investigated the effect of encouraging students to compare rather than isolate variables. In Airbags,
students who were guided to isolate variables often missed important insights by limiting their analysis to one
variable at a time. Prompting students to compare variables led to a more nuanced understanding of the Airbags
situation  particularly   for  high   prior  knowledge       students,   achieved    at  least  partly  by  using   diverse
experimentation strategies.
          Our findings point to the value of providing opportunities for multiple approaches to experimentation
rather than guiding students only to isolate variables. The findings suggest that instructional designers should
balance   guidance  designed   to promote    CVS    with   opportunities    to explore   the nature  and   meaning   of the
variables.   Designers  of instruction should     select problems    where    subtle distinctions such   as thresholds  are
necessary for complete understanding. Many everyday problems such as decisions about drug dosage require an
understanding    of thresholds.  Our   study   demonstrates      the value  of connecting    experimentation    to  real-life
contexts such as airbags, where students can appreciate connections between science instruction and everyday
life.
          This study also illustrates the value of providing students with graphical representations to help them
make valid inferences from their experiments. Our detailed analysis of the ways students reasoned with the
Airbags visualization revealed that the graphs were essential for comparing multiple trials, revisiting previous
ideas, and interpreting collision events. How graphing tools should be designed to support scientific reasoning
merits further study.
