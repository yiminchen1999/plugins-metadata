         A bst r act :  Seamless   learning  environments      help  students  in  extending    their learning
        experiences     across  social, personal   and  environmental    dimensions,  and   are supported    by
        different tools, information and communication technology. In order to capture the evidence
        of the ways students utilize mobile devices in their formal and informal learning pursuits, a
        quiet  data     capture program    was   designed    and pilot-tested. It  is used   to capture     both
        quantitative and qualitative data about device use, to track user generated data and artefacts
        persistent     across time and    to generate   and  render   aggregated   reports  identifying  usage
        patterns. It is supposed to serve as a mechanism of identifying affordances of mobile devices
        within  the     landscape  of   seamless   learning. Some     preliminary  findings  raising   multiple
        questions and inevitably sharpening our research lenses are presented towards the end of the
        paper.

Introduction
Mobile devices are nowadays used by younger generations on a daily basis to access web content, to capture
different artefacts (e.g. photos, voice recordings, notes etc) documenting daily activities, and to communicate
with peers via synchronous (e.g. Skype for mobile devices) and asynchronous tools (e.g. SMS). However, their
popularity is hardly ever extended into classrooms since school policies see mobile devices as a disruptive
factor. Moreover, lesson plans and assessment strategies employed in many educational institutions usually do
not allow these innovative technologies to be used as pervasive learning tools.
        On the other hand, mobile devices are, according to some researchers, an enabling force to transform
education (Roschelle & Pea, 2002; Sharples, Taylor, & Vavoula, 2005; Waycott, 2004; Zurita & Nussbaum,
2004). At this point, there exist numerous case studies illustrating innovative ways of incorporating mobile
devices into various classroom activities (Anastopoulou, et al., 2008; Ardito, Buono, Costabile, Lanzilotti, &
Pederson, 2007; Chen, Kao, Yu, & Sheu, 2004; Colella, 2000; Dufresne, Gerace, Leonard, Mestre, & Wenk,
1996; Facer, et al., 2004; Klopfer, Squire, & Jenkins, 2009; Proctor & Burton, 2003; Rogers & al., 2002;
Roschelle, 2003; Sharples, Lonsdale, Meek, Rudman, & Vavoula, 2007; Vahey & Crawford, 2002). Moreover,
some researchers have produced encouraging results for policy makers willing to participate in this exciting
process of educational change (Klopfer, et al., 2009; Sharples, et al., 2005)
        Although there is still lack of theories of mobile learning from pedagogical perspectives (Sharples, et
al., 2005; Vavoula & Sharples, 2008), it is evident that mobile devices are becoming pervasively integrated into
student activities outside    schools.  While  there is  no  doubt  that students  utilize them  in   their daily  leisure

help of these ubiquitously present tools. Even more intriguing questions start to emerge as we delve into this
heavily under-explored area on pedagogical issues: is there a way of establishing a link between classroom and
informal daily activities with the mediation of mobile devices? What kind of skills can be better taught with
mobile devices? Can they be used for inquiry learning redirecting knowledge from informal into formally
structured learning    environments    or vice versa?   All  these  together  with other   emergent    issues  are being
examined under the Seamless Learning project conducted in Singapore (see Looi, 2010 for more details). Both
formal and informal learning spaces are being explored together with the synergistic effects of linking the two in
order to achieve the continuity of learning experiences across different learning scenarios. The project tries to
achieve so called 6seamlessness7 with the combinations of different parameters across multiple dimensions of
learning environments.
        The aim of this paper is not to answer all the above stated questions, but to focus on designing a tool
that can be both used to capture and analyse invaluable information generated from everyday activities with
mobile  devices that    primary  school   children are  involved  in. In order  to collect  the evidence    of the ways
students utilize mobile devices in their formal and informal learning pursuits, a quiet data capture program was
designed and pilot-tested. The program is used to capture both quantitative and qualitative data about device
ussage and to track user generated data and artefacts persistent across time and locations. The gathered data is
aggregated in a form of reports helping researchers to pinpoint the areas of informal activities relevant to formal
learning. Experiences gathered this way can be used in designing lesson plans which incorporate mobile devices

         The paper is organized as follows: we first present the theoretical background of the Seamless Learning
project in relation to mobile learning. Then, we present the design and development of the quiet capture tool,
followed  by some     collected  data  and    preliminary      reports   used   to  better understand     seamless  learning
experiences; and we conclude with future research plans and implications.

From Mobile Learning to Seamless Learning
         The technological strand of researchers in the area of mobile learning has focused on mobile devices,
such as identification of device characteristics important to learning, the development of systems for mobile
learning, appropriation of mobile devices for effective learning. An example of device-focused definitions of
mobile   learning can be   described   as   learning activities     using mobile    phones,   handheld    computers,  digital
portable devices for music reproduction, digital cameras, voice recorders and digital pens (Excellence, 2006;
Freitas & Levene, 2003; Wikipedia, 2009; Wood, Keen, Basu, & Robertshaw, 2003) The other strand of mobile
learning research  still focuses on  devices,   but   explores      the role of related  technological    aspects, including
wireless networks,  intelligent  user  interfaces    and  generally     the  advancements     in the development     of both
hardware and software computer equipment which makes mobile learning possible (Boticki, Mornar, & Bozic,
2006; Holzinger, Kickmeier-:-'#();)<.3&*#()=>>?@)A5B!..&C);)!.D()=>>E@)F!,4()=>>EG. On the other hand, the
pedagogical strand positions technological solutions coupled with the areas of learning and teaching they can
best support HA5B!..&C) ;) !.D() =>>EG.     According     to   this strand,  technology    should be  designed  to   support
learning, rather than being appropriated to reach certain pedagogical goals. Hence, mobile devices are seen as
mediating tools for activities supporting constructivist and situative approaches to learning.
         Some researchers analyze the mobility of the learners as the primary characteristic of mobile learning
(Kress & Pachler, 2007). Since learners learn on various locations, knowledge acquired at one location can be
applied to others (Freitas & Levene, 2003; Sharples, 2000). Mobility of knowledge can be seen in terms of time
scales as well. Previously acquired knowledge is supplemented with new ideas and strategies over time. For
instance, Sharples and colleagues (2005) suggest that Some researchers suggest hat by placing the 6mobility of
learning as the object of analysis we may understand better how knowledge and skills can be transferred across
contexts such as home and school, how learning can be managed across life transitions, and how new
technologies can be designed to support a society in which people on the move increasingly try to cram learning
into the interstices of daily life (p.2)7D
         The Seamless Learning project in Singapore presented in this paper examines synergistic effects of
linking formal and informal learning environments in order to achieve the continuity of learning experiences
across different learning scenarios. It examines both individual and social approaches to learning and tries to
determine the role of one-to-one TEL (technology enhanced learning) in Primary (elementary) School children5'
learning experiences (Looi, et al., 2010)..
         From pedagogical perspective, seamless learning examines an inevitable shift from teacher-centred to
learner-centred learning environments and tackles the issues of traditional schooling practices suffering from the
excessive  amount   of   decontextualized     information,     indirect   and   abstract   knowledge,     and  second   hand
experiences (Barab, 2002). Many of t21!C5')".!''*22+ learning still have a strong focus on individual cognition,
pure mental activity without tool use and overly context-general learning (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989).
Through the notion of seamless learning, we aim to examine learning that takes place through the individual
learning in private spaces, collaborative learning in public spaces, together with the cognitive artefacts created
across time and physical or virtual spaces mediated by technology within a context. These artefacts facilitate
knowledge  construction    and  social discourse,    and  mediate       interaction among   a community     of learners. To
achieve so, we have employed distributed cognition as a theoretical lens and have integrated ethnographic
approaches into our research design, especially in examining informal learning experiences (Hollan, Hutchins,
& Kirsch, 2001; Looi, et al., 2010).
         Our research is twofold: on the one hand, it examines formal learning environments and proactively

For example, our participants, 39 primary school students, organize and externalize their knowledge with the
help of  GoKnow    mobile   learning   suite  (Figure 1),    practice   collaborative  skills using  the  Seamless   Mobile
Forum (Figure 2), and other applications available on their HTC Windows Mobile 6.0 based smartphones.

Capturing the Evidence of Seamless Learning on Mobile Devices

Choosing a Data Collection Approach
In addition to examining seamlessness within formal learning environments, our goal is to examine student-
initiated learning that is impromptu and emergent (Sefton-Green, 2004). To achieve that, we have decided to
employ    a  concurrent mixed   method  as a  data collection     and  interpretation  approach  (Creswell,  2009).
Quantitative data collection helps us in getting the idea of general trends while qualitative methods allow us to
extract specifically significant patterns or cases for more in-depth analysis. Qualitative and quantitative data
collection   mechanisms  are exercised concurrently,  thus   bringing   us  towards a  clearer picture  of  informal
learning spaces, together with the role of mobile devices in facilitating such learning experiences.
          In our Seamless  Learning project,  qualitative   data collection methods    include sustained  classroom
observations, interviews with the students and their families, and observational studies (Sefton-Green, 2004).
Sustained classroom observations enable us both to gain the holistic picture of the classroom atmosphere and to

family members primarily focusing on the informal learning experiences outside classrooms. Observational
studies are used in designed spaces (currently in a science museum) to capture both video and sound clips of
entire family visits to examine family interaction and discourse in a designed informal learning space.
          Quantitative instruments utilized in the project include surveys, experiments and log files. Surveys
primarily serve as a mechanism for longitudinal evaluation used to compare formal assessment results and
students5 attitudes towards the mobile device use at project milestones. Survey instruments therefore both guide
us in our future research pursuits and provide us with a means of evaluating long-term effects of our inevitably
interventionist  approach. Experiments are used to    test  out  novel tools, such  as mobile  computer    supported
fractions software, primarily in order to gather usability and learning experience feedback. Unobtrusive methods
such as log files provide an authentic, time-efficient means of recording student learning behaviours and can
capture a wide range of data that reflect student practices, activities, context, situations and events (Buckley,
Gobert, & Horwitz, 2006; Cole, 1995).

Mixed Method Approach to Quiet Captures
One of  the  common     methods of collecting data from     mobile  devices   is through log   files that support an
objective data collection method of acquiring quantitative data on device usage. Due to the convergence trend
(i.e., mobile and communication devices merging into a single device), mobile devices are becoming powerfully
connected computers allowing the development of specialized applications to be installed and used on them.
Log files are sometimes referred to as the quiet captures emphasizing the unobtrusiveness of the way they are

spent.
          In addition to their obviously limited coverage and purely quantitative orientation, current log file
applications require researchers to periodically gather logs from 9!*#$"$9!,#'5) devices, thus to a certain level
interfering their experiences. Furthermore, user generated artefacts are not tracked persistently across time (i.e.
students delete self-created videos), and do not capture the context of student-device interaction during the
identified patterns of usage. Therefore we propose a mixed mode quiet capture approach with the following
features: (a) the ability to capture both quantitative and qualitative data about device usage, (b) the ability to
transfer and track user generated data and artefacts persistently (i.e., created movies, sound clips and pictures)
to researchers in real-time 24/7 and (c) the ability to generate and render aggregated reports identifying usage
patterns.

         Qualitative approaches to collecting device usage data consist of capturing device screenshots when
some specific applications are used and/or when users start interacting with the device. Those screenshots are
timely ordered and sent to the central repository through the 3G wireless mobile connection. Captured screens
are then available to researchers in form of a web site and can be browsed and filtered according to the attached
contextual  information.  Quantitative  approaches  to collecting  data rely on   the classical log file method   of
collecting the duration of application usage extended with a possibility of transferring content to the central
repository in real-time.
         Our subjects are equipped with mobile broadband plans with unlimited data transfer package. In this
context, 3G connection serves as a means of providing affordable real-time 24/7 data transferring channels to
central data  repositories. This  eliminates two    drawbacks  of  the  classical quiet  captures   approaches:  (a)
researchers do not have to manually gather the collected data from mobile devices in order to analyze it, and (b)
data is available for the analysis whenever the need exists. Moreover, student generated artefacts are stored
across time: pictures, files and videos are stored and become inerasable proof of user activities available for
future analysis.
         Researchers are provided with the web interface through which qualitative and quantitative data can be
analyzed (Figure 3 on the next page). Quantitative data can be examined through the various reports while
qualitative data is given to researchers for further detailed analysis. Both can serve as a connecting point not
only in cross-modality verification of the results, but also in the interpretation of data acquired by employing
various collection methods.

Quiet Capture Tool Architecture
The tool   gathers various  types  of  information, such  as application usage,   student generated   artefacts  and
screenshots to transmit them to the server side web service over the 3G wireless network. The transferred data is
kept persistently into the server-side database for later retrieval. The stored data is available to researchers in the
forms   of predesigned   reports 24/7. Students can  therefore be  monitored   real-time, and   usage statistics are
generated on demand (Figure 4.)

    emergent inquiry based learning (a student           Figure 4. Quit capture tool system architecture
    searching for information on Heron birds)

         Needless to say, such a design requires mobile devices to be equipped with mobile broadband wireless
Internet access plans with adequate bandwidth. In our project, students, in addition to the devices themselves,
are given the 24/7 Internet access with unlimited data transfer plans. Instances of the quiet capture tool were
installed onto the student devices, and they run as long as the devices are on. As soon as students decide to turn

Reports on the Formal and Informal Device Use
The value of the described quiet capture approach lies in the analysis performed on the collected data generating
aggregated reports about device use. At this point, we are able to share rough reports generated from the data of
our 39 primary school students tracked both in and out school over one month. Although the amount of data is
not significant to draw any final conclusions, we feel that the reports match and supplement the findings from
other employed data collection instruments and surely inform us of behaviours exhibited by the students.
         To depict the average time students spent on using the devices, we employ the functional framework in

          Figure 6. shows that our students were mostly involved into the 6Referential7 activities (46% of the
average time a student spent on purposely using the device) which include web browsing, checking dictionaries,
accessing  course    materials, etc.  In    addition to that,   students were     often engaged                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              into   the Data    Collection,
Interactive Activities and Games. Since R!##&,)&#)!.5')(2006) functional framework does not clearly state which
category should mobile computer games assigned to, in our analysis we are considering them as a separate
category (Figure 6).
          To get a clearer picture on the data presented in the Figure 6, a more detailed report is made available
to researchers (Table 1). In addition to the average time students spent on a specific activity type, the report
shows minimum, maximum values and the standard derivation extracted from a month data of student activities.
This report makes the differences in student interest more evident, particularly when some categories, such as
games or interactive applications are concerned.
          In order to gain an in-depth picture on the specific application use, researchers can drill-down the

Figure 7. Average monthly time (in minutes) a student spent on using specific application (given only for the 15
                                               top applications)

One of the   main aims  of   our project is to examine    the relationship of the formal  and  informal  learning
environments. In order to achieve so, we have analyzed specific application usage according to the time of the
day: Table 2 has specific application names and times of the day as its two-dimensional base, while the third
dimension contains average student monthly usage. The chart serves as a visual aid in determining the patches
of significant user activities enabling researchers to drill down and identify specific sub-categories of interest.

Table 2. A table showing average monthly time (in seconds) a student spent on a specific application according
                                             to the time of the day

Researchers might opt to examine a specific application for a more refined analysis. For example, the contour
chart signals high overall usage of the Internet Explorer application throughout the entire day, especially being
the extreme in the end of the day.

Conclusion and Future Plans
The paper presented one of the tools in the mixed mode approach for capturing mobile device use data from
both formal and informal learning environments. We presented the quiet capture tool to gather application usage
information, student-created  artefacts and screenshots.   Researchers  can use  the reports generated  from        the
"2..&"#&1)1!#!)#2)&M!+$,&)'#-1&,#'5)-'&)28)+23$.&)1&%$"&')across different location and time scales.
       Preliminary findings presented in this paper show that students tend to spend a significant amount of
time on using the device in their personal spaces. They mostly browse the Internet for information and videos,
and create interactive digital artefacts. For some students, the informal use of mobile devices produces a shift in
cognitive processing skills, while  for the others the   device  has become   a social mediating tool  facilitating
interaction with the classmates.

                                                  505     ISLS

         It should be noted that all data reported in this paper is collected with the participants5 consensus for
confidentiality and privacy issues. Researchers need to consider that such quiet capture tools may collect private
data unwanted by the participants so that it is important to ensure user anonymity and ethical use of collected
data.
         Future research plans include working with researchers on developing new views on the collected data,
developing triangulation methods for merging data gathered from other data collection methods and further
expanding the amount of data to be collected. As an example, there are plans to introduce geo-tagging of all
collected information in order to enable the creation of location-based reports. In addition to analysing informal
learning experiences      according   to a   new  spatial dimension,      we will  employ    data mining and    aggregation
techniques to determine in what extent our students use the devices in and out school, specifically focusing on
several spatio-temporal categories: in-school, holiday, during weekends and during the week.
         Although      at this point  we     observe that students   use  mobile   devices  to learn  beyond   the  walls of
classroom and formal institutions, and the usage clearly impacts their formal learning experiences, we are still in
the process of designing mechanisms to clearly prove so. We believe the Quiet Captures tool presented in this
paper can be used to give us better understanding of the context in which the links emerge and vanish. We have
only begun to understand the complex interplay of formal and informal learning spaces constantly having in
mind that it is our job to nurture the link between formal and informal learning environments and to utilize this
unique opportunity to promote holistic learning experiences.
