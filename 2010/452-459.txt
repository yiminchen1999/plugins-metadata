         Abstract: Should the construct `motivation to transfer' used inhuman resource development
         and  management    research  be  also   used in   learning research? The  current   study   revisited
         motivation  to transfer  on  a  sample    of 128 participants    of  occupational  health   training.
         Confirmatory factor analysis and partial least square-sbased path modeling were used to test
         the hypothesized dimensions and relationships among variables inlcuding social and affective
         cues  on  training transfer. Based    on  a  combination      of the theory   of planned  behavior,
         expectancy theory, and self-determination theory, we validated three dimensions of transfer
         motivation: autonomous      motivation    to   transfer, controlled   motivation   to  transfer,  and
         intentions to transfer. Results indicate that autonomous motivation was affected by attitudes
         toward training  content  and   utility reactions; controlled  motivation   was  affected   by utility
         reactions, supervisory support,and social norms. Intentions to transfer mediated the effecst of
         autonomous     motivation   on   transfer    three   months    after  training. Implications   of  a
         multidisciplinary perspective combining learning sciences and human resource development
         are discussed.

The Noe Model Revisited
In 2006, in  a  discussion  on how   motivation    influences   transfer, Pugh   and   Bergin (p. 155)  recommended
adopting the construct motivation to transfer from thehuman resource development (HRD) literature to the
learning sciences; their recommendation was published in a highly influential journal inthe field, Educational
Psychologist. Twenty years earlier, Raymond Noe coined the term `motivation to transfert'hat Pugh and Bergin
were referring to as "the trainees' desire to use the knowledge and skills mastered in the trainingprogram on the
job" (Noe, 1986, p. 743). His work was published in a highly influential journal in the feild of management and
HRD, Academy of Management Review. It is argued here that it would be fatal if learning scientists followed
Pugh and Bergin's advice to adopt the construct from HRD research to learning research. This is for five
reasons. First, motivation to transfer currently is a on-edimensional construct that is too coarseto adequately
reflect motivational states and traits in the transfer process. Second, motivation to transfer currnetly is not, and
was not, adequately grounded in motivation theories. Third, there is poor empiricalevidence in the HRD and
management literature on how motivation to transfer affectstransfer of learning. Fourth, motivation to transfer
currently is a static construct, only measured immediately following an intervention. Finally, Noe (1986) said
little in his original conceptualization about the social origin oftransfer motivation; this reflected the zeitgeist of
the 1980s epoch. Learning researchers nowcan be thoughtful in adopting a more balanced view.
         It is argued further that motivation to transfer does indeed play a central role in the transfer process;
there is enough theoretical (and common sense) backdrop to expect that learners who are motivated toapply
training content from training to work, or from the classroom to ou-tof-classroom use, are more likely to be
successful than learners who are not motivated. Yet, in its current form, motivation to transfer semes to be a
construct powerless to account for intentional transfer processes. Transfer, from a human resource perspective,
is defined as the successful application of newly trained knowledge, skills, and attitudes to the workplace (Noe,
1986; Burke & Hutchins, 2007). Hence, we argue that before following Pugh's and Bergin's recommendation,
Noe's  model   of  motivation  to  transfer must   be   revisited   in several significant  respects: dimensionality,
theoretical grounding, empirical evidence, measurement time,and social nature of motivation.
         On revisiting dimensionality, motivation to transfer has been measured as a one-dimensional construct
in empirical training research over the past twenty-five years or so (Noe & Schmitt, 1986; Velada, Caetano,
Bates, & Holton, 2009). In our recent review on motivation to transfer (Gegenfurtner, Veermans, Festner, &
Gruber,  2009), we  found   that all 31  studies  on  transfer motivation     reported in international pee-rreviewed
journals from 1986 to now used a one-dimensional scale to assess the construct, ranging from one item to eleven
items. This is a paradox since motivation researchers have explored numerous dimenisons of motivational
processes in human actions. To name just a few, we know of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; consiocus goal
intentions and unconscious implementation intentions; expectancies, instrumentalities, and valencesv; arious
types of motivational   regulation   and mindsets;   and   we  differentiate  motivation,  volition, and   emotion.  All
contribute to  our understanding   of  the many    facets   and   colorsthat  motivation  has. Motivation  to   transfer

potentially goes in concert with all of the dimensions justmentioned. It can be argued that motivation to transfer
has remained a one-dimensional construct to date because it lacks a clear grounding in motivation theories.
          On revisiting theoretical grounding,Noe (1986; Noe & Schmitt, 1986) made no explicit statement as to
which   theoretical  framework the  idea   of  motivation   to   transfer is based;  although there are   references to
Bandura, Latham, and Vroom in their original papers, the associated motivation theories refer not to transfer
motivation but to other aspects of the papers. Hence, motivation to transfer lackedfrom the start, and still lacks,
a solid foundation in motivation theories. In an attempt to provide a first step toward resolving this situation,we
conducted two studies in which the theory of planned behavior (Gegenfurtner & Gruber, 2009)and expectancy
and self-determination theory(Gegenfurtner, Festner, Gallenberger, Lehtinen, & Gruber, 2009) were tested as a
basis  for transfer  motivation scales. In short,  these   studies  indicate  that motivation to transfer has  several
dimensions: autonomous motivation to transfer, controlled motivation to transfer, and intentiosn to transfer.
These are the first steps, and more efforts are needed to validate the construct's theoretical groundingfor human
resource development beyond.
          On revisiting empirical evidence, it is a likely explanation that the one-dimensionality and the lack of
theoretical grounding account for the current state of poor evidence on the intention-behavior relationship in
training transfer. Correlation coefficients ranging from0.04 (Tziner, Haccoun, & Kadish, 1991) to 0.63 (Machin
& Fogarty, 1997) suggest that the relation between motivation to transfer and transfer of training needs further
elaboration. Again, we believe that a starting point for this elaboration is a reconceptualization of Noe's model
of transfer motivation. This may help to form new research practices with respect to the multidimensional nature
of transfer motivation, its groundwork in valid motivation theories, and its measurement time.
          On revisiting  measurement     time, our review     of transfer  motivation  (Gegenfurtner   et al., 2009b)
indicated that, in 30 of 31 cases, the construct was assessed at the immediate end of training. Only Leitl and
Zempel-Dohmen (2006) measured transfer motivation at the immediate end and at a later point in time, three
months after the intervention. We believe that motivation to transfer in particular, like motivation for action in
general, dynamicallychanges over time. Hence, assessment of transfer motivation at a time when the learnerhas
had time to explore opportunities to use training in ou-tof-classroom applications may provide a very different
picture than the assessment of transfer motivation at a time when the learner is just about to levae the classroom.
Yet, empirical examinations at a different time than athe immediate end of training are almost non-existent.
          On revisiting the social nature of motivation, there is large consensus that motivation is intrinsically
social in nature (Hickey, Moore, & Pellegrino, 2001; Järvelä, Volet, & Järvenoja, 2100; Vauras, Salonen, &
Kinnunen, 2008). We argue that this holds equally for transfer motivation. Especially when trainees spent some
time at the workplace and could test the training content about its usefulness, social cues might affect formation
and persistence of motivational states to transfer training. Arguably,the generation of more stable motivational
traits is also influenced by factors such as social norms, feelings of relatedness, orcontrol beliefs that are based
on environmental (working) conditions emanated in social interaction. Noe(1986) constructed his model of
transfer   motivation at a  time  in  which    the  social    nature of   motivation  was  not   on the   agenda   yet.
Reconceptualizing the Noe model can account for this development in motivation research.

Present Study
The present study had a dual goal. First, it aimed to test the multidimensionality of motivation to transfer.
Multidimensionality was achieved by using a combined motivationtheory approach. Specifically,there was a
combination of a validated framework from educational psychology,self-determination theory (Baard, Deci, &
Ryan, 2004), and a validated framework from management research, expectancy theory (Vroom, 2005), to
conceptualize  autonomous     and controlled   motivation     to transfer. Expectancy  theory  as a  cognitive-choice
approach   and   self-determination theory    as a need-motive-value      approach   can  complement   each   other  in
predicting  and  explaining human    performance    in  the   workplace   (Kanfer,  1990). Thus,  instrumentality  and
valence items reflecting externally prompted reasons to transfer were used to assess controlled movtiation.
Conversely, instrumentality and valence items reflecting internally regulated behaviour were used toassess
autonomous motivation. Autonomous motivation to transferis defined here as an internalized desire to transfer
learning that is initiated and governed by the self (i.e,. regulated by identification or byintegration with one's
values), and controlled motivation as a desire to transfer learning that is not initiated and governed by the self
(i.e., regulated by  external rewards or   sanctions). In   addition  to  autonomous   and  controlled  motivation   as
measures of motivational traits, intentions to transfer are also included as measures of motivational states. This
is because contrary to motivational traits, intentions represent a more activated, situaiot n-specific motivational
state. We used Ajzen's (1991) theory of planned behaviour, a wel-lvalidated framework from social psychology,
to conceptualize intentions to transfer.
          The second goal was to test a hypothesized path model, shown in Figure 1. The model explored a
motivational sequence. Effects of autonomous and controlled motivation on training transferare mediated by
the more situation-specific state of transfer intentions; at the sametime, situational but distal social (relatedness,
support,   control, and norms)  and  affective   (attitudes and   utility reactions) cues  on transfer  intentions  are

mediated by more stable motivational traits, i.e., autonomous and controlled motivation to transfe.r It can be
argued that motivational traitsact like filters. For example, supervisory support mayor may not lead to activated
intentions, depending on the motivational trait. The model has a range of hypothesized relationships; these are
based on theory or past empirical evidence. Specifically,the hypothesis, based on self-determination theory,
predicted that relatedness (RE) at work would foster internalization of external regulations and would thus be
positively related  to autonomous  motivation   to  transfer  B( aard et al., 2004;  Gegenfurtner   et al., 2009a).
Supervisory support (SU) was shown to have mixed empirical results on motivation, depending on whether
support was perceived to be instrumental or not; we thus expected relations to both autonomous and controlled
motivation. Based   on  the theory of  planned   behavior (Ajzen,     1991),  it was  hypothesized  that   perceived
behavioral  control (PBC)  promoted   trainees' feelings  of autonomy    and  would   thus be   more important   for
autonomous motives; at the same time, social norms(NO) were hypothesized to have stronger effects for those
trainees with controlled  motivation.  Past research  showed   that   attitudes  toward  training conten(t AT) were
related to both autonomous and controlled motivation (Gegenfurtner et al.,2009a). Utility reactions (UT) were
hypothesized to affect self-determined feelings of autonomy; however, due to their instrumental nature, it was
speculated that they could also affect controlled motivation.

Method

Participants and Procedure
The participants in the study were 496 employees who attended one of the 23 training programs on occupational
health and safety following German statutory accident insurance regulations. Three months after the training,
trainees received a paper-and-pencil questionnaire sent to their workplace.The questionnaire collected self-
report data that, despite the known problems (e.g., leniency, self-serving bias), seemed adequate to use because
a major interest was trainees' self-perceived attitudinal and motivational states.One hundred thirty-one trainees
(26.4%)  completed  and  returned  the questionnaire. Deletion   of   three multivariate outlying  cases ultimately
yielded a final sample size of 128 trainees.The majority of the participants was between 41 and 50 years old
(43.1%) and has worked with their current employer for up to five years(25.0%); the average organization size
was between   100   and  199 employees   (68.8%). There      was no   statistically significant difference  between
respondents and non-respondents. Participation in the study was voluntary, with informed consent forms signed
by the trainees. Anonymity and confidentiality were guaranteed for all responses.

Instruments
Unless otherwise indicated, a 5-point response scale was used for all items, with 1 =strongly does not agree, 2
= does not agree, 3 = partly agrees, 4 = agrees, and 5 = strongly agrees. All scales were pilot-tested; minor
revisions in expressions and the orderingof items were reflected in the final version of the instrumentT. able 1

Demographic and Organizational Membership Characteristics
Demographic and organizational membership characteristicswere measured to establish nomological validity.
One of each item was used to assess organizational tenure (`How long have you worked with your current
employer?';1= up to 5 years, 2=6-10, 3=11-15, 4=16-20, 5=21 years or more), organization size (`How many
people are employed in your company?'; 1=1-9 employees, 2=10-19, 3=20-49, 4=50-99, 5=100-199, 6=200-
249, 7=250-349, 8=350-549, 9=550-999, 10=1000-1999, 11=2000 employees or more), and age (1=up to 30,
2=31-40, 3=41-50, 4=51-60, 5=more than 60 years old).

Independent Variables: Social and Affective Cues
This study used social and affective cues as independent variables. First, social cues were measured with scales
on relatedness, supervisory support, perceivedbehavioral control, and social norms.To assess relatedness, five
items were used based on the Basic Psychological Needs Scale at Work (Baard et al., 2004; Gegenfurtner et al.,
2009a); the items measured the extent to which trainees felt connected and resepcted in their organizations(e.g.,
`People at work care about me'). To assess supervisory support, five items were used that measured support
associated with goal-setting and feedback (e.g., `I try to achieve pre-set goals by applying what I have learnedin
training on the job'). To assess perceivedbehavioral control, we included five items that measured participants'
perceived capability of and confidence in transferring the training to theirworkplace (e.g., `I feel capable to
apply the training content at work'). To assess social norms, five items were used that reflected the degree to
which participants perceived social normative pressure from referents important to the trainees toeprform or not
to perform a certain behavior (e.g., `My boss sets a high value on applying the training content at work').
         Second, affective cues were measured with scales on utility reactions and attitudes toward training
content. To     assess   utility reactions, items  developed by    Tai  (2006)  were     used that   measured    the affective
experience on whether the training has been useful during the last three months (e.g., `Today, I judge the
usefulness of the training as: 1=very low, 2=low, 3=average, 4=high, 5=very high'). To assess attitudes toward
training content, five items were used to measure cognitive and emotional/affective aspects of attitudes towards
occupational health and safety (Ajzen, 2001; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Gegenfurtner et al., 2009a). Sample items
were as follows: for cognition, `I easily come up with at least fivereasons for complying with safety and health
regulations', and for emotion, `I feel responsible for health and safety in my working area'.

Mediating Variables: Motivation to Transfer
Motivation to transfer was measured with threedistinct scales specifying autonomous motivation to transfer,
controlled motivation to transfer, and intentionto transfer (Gegenfurtner et al., 2009a; Gegenfurtner & Gruber,
2009). For autonomous motivation, two pairs of items were included to measure instrumentality and valenceof
autonomous motives for training transfer. Sample itemswere as follows: for instrumentality, `While applying
training at  work,     I   can learn  a lot', and  for valence,    `This  learning  is   important to   me'.   For controlled
motivation, two pairs of items were included to measure instrumentality and valence of controlled motives for
training transfer.  Sample       items were as  follows:  for instrumentality,  `Successful     application    of  the training
content will probably result in a materialistic reward, such as a financilabonus', and for valence, `This reward is
important to me'. A five-item scale was used to measure intention to transfer (e.g., `I have tried intentionally to
apply the training content to my workplace, regardless how well it actually worked').

Dependent Variable: Transfer of Training
To assess transfer of training, five itemsdescribed in Festner and Gruber (2008) were used to measure self-
perceived change in knowledge, skills, and attitudes towardthe training content, occupational health and safety
(e.g., `Today, I engage more in health and safety than I did before the training').

Data Analyses
A two-stage procedure was adopted for data analysis. First, the factorial validity of the revisited construct of
motivation   to  transfer     was assessed.   This was   done   using  confirmatory      factor analysis   (CFA).  Given     an
appropriate level of communality, CFA was considered meaningful (MacCallum, Widaman, Zhang, & Hong,
1999). Based     on the    EQS    6.1 (Bentler,  2005) software,   three  first-order  CFA    models    designed   to  test the
multidimensionality        of the theoretical  construct were   examined.   The    first model   was    a three-factor model
composed of autonomous motivation to transfer, controlled motivation to transfer, and intention to transfe.rThe
second   model   was     a two-factor   model  in  which  autonomous     and   controlled  motivation were      merged    as if
representing one factor. Finally, the third model was a one-factor model that forced autonomous motivation to
transfer, controlled motivation to transfer, and intention to transferinto one factor (which is the current research
practice). Data were screened to test for multivariate outliers, normalit,y and multi-collinearity (Kline, 2005).
The direct   maximum        likelihood  approach was    used  as   a missing   data  specification    procedure    and robust
methods as normality estimator corrections. Assessment of the model fit was based on four criteria reflecting
statistical and  theoretical     considerations.  The  criteria   were as follows:  (1)   the   Yuan­Bentler    scaled !2   test
statistic, (2) the comparative fit index (CFI), (3) the standardized roo-tmean square residual (SRMR), and (4) the
root-mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), with its 90% confidence interval (CI). This rationale was
based  upon     literature    recommendations   (Bentler,  2005;   Kline,   2005). For   cut-off    criteria, guidelines were
followed    for CFI>0.95,      SRMR<0.09,     and  the RMSEA<0.06       (Hu  &  Bentler,    1999)    to indicate   appropriate
goodness-of-fit. Validation of the three-dimensional construct seemed important to test the extent to which the
measured variables actually represent the theoretical dimensions.
         Once    the   factorial   validity of  motivation   to   transfer was established,     its mediating   position    was
assessed in our hypothesized model. This was done using path analysis following a partial least squares (PLS)

                                                       455  ·   © ISLS

    approach. Contrary to other estimation techniques like multiple regression or structural equation modelingP, LS
    can be applied to a non-normally distributed data set collected with a small sample C( hin & Newstead, 1999).
    Based on the SmartPLS 2.0 (Ringle, Wende, & Will, 2005) software, the relationships among the varialebs were
    assessed  using  the  path   weighting    scheme      algorithm.  Importantly,      PLS   is   an approach    for  predicting
    relationships in a model, not for assessing overall model fit. However,Table 1 reports three reliability indices to
    indicate appropriate psychometrics properties of the measurement model.sFor cutoff-criteria, guidelines were
    followed  for  Cronbach's    alpha>0.70,  the average     variance      extracted (AVE)>0.50,     and the composite     scale
    reliability (CSR)>0.60 (Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, & Tatham, 2006). Mediation was analyzed followingthe
    recommendations by MacKinnon, Fairchild, and Fritz (2007).

    Results
    Screening   of the  data    revealed no  multicollinearity       but multivariate   nonnormality     (Yuan,   Lambert,    and
    Fouladi's  normalized    estimate=45.88).     Three    multivariate      outlying   cases    with  a  substantial   different
    contribution to normalized multivariate kurtosiswere subsequently deleted from all analyses. Table 1 presents
    psychometric properties and correlation coefficients of the measures.The next two sections describe test results
    for multidimensionality of motivation to transfer and for the hypothesized path model.

    Testing for Multidimensionality
    The model to be tested a priori postulates that motivation to transferthree months after training is a three-
    factorial structure composed     of autonomous        motivation     to transfer,  controlled  motivation   to transfe,r and
    intention to transfer. The three-factor model was tested first; then it was compared to the two-factor model and
    the one-factor model. Fit statistics relative to these models are presented inTable 2. In reviewing the CFI,
    SRMR, RMSEA, and "2 test statistic values in Table 2, it is evident that the hypothesized three-factor model
    represented the best fit to the data.

    After CFA, construct validity of the three-factor solution was tested by assessing convergent, discriminant,
    nomological, and face validity. We followed the guidelines from Hairet al. (2006). First, concerning convergent
    validity, the variance-extracted measures (AVE) of AM, CM, and IN exceeded the 50% level, and the reliability
    estimates were larger than .70. Although twofactor loadings were below .50, they did not appear to significantly
    harm the model fit or internal consistency; hence, convergent validity was established. Second,a construct is
    divergently valid if the variance-extracted estimates for each factor are larger than the squared interconstruct

correlations associated with this factor (Hair et al., 2006). Table 1 reports AVE and squared interocrrelations.
All variance-extracted estimates are larger than the corresponding squared intercorrelation estimates; hence,
divergent   validity of AM,    CM, and    IN was  established. Third,    concerning  nomological    validity, Hair and
colleagues (2006) recommend comparingthe constructs to other variables not included in the model, which, in
this study, were     demographic   and  organizational    memberhsip    characteristics. The  three  factors  were  not
significantly affected by trainee age, organizational tenure, or organization size; hence, nomologaicl validity
was established. Finally, face validity of the three dimensions was established based on discusios ns among the
authors AG and DF about the content of the corresponding items. In summary,both the established construct
validity and the acceptable model fit indicated good conditions tofurther test the hypothesized relationshipsof
the three-factor solution in the PLS path model.

Testing the Hypothesized Path Model
Table 3 presents the parameter estimates of the hypothesized path model.Mediation analysis (MacKinnon et al.,
2007) indicates that intention to transfer mediated the effect of autonomous motivation on training transfer;
autonomous motivation had a stronger effect on intentions than controlled motivation. Supervisory support,
social norms, and utility reactions significantly affecetd controlled motivation while attitudes toward training
content and utility reactions affected autonomous motivation. It is interesting to note that supervisory support
seems to be effective for controlled motivation, but not for autonomous motivation. Despitethe hypotheses, the
paths  from  relatedness,   support,   and perceived  behavioral    control  to autonomous      motivation   were  non-
significant, as was the path from controlled motivation to transfer to intention to transfer. Thisnidicates that
autonomous motives lead to more activated intentions than controlled motivetshree months after training.

Discussion and Conclusion
The   theme  of  ICLS2010      invited an  exploration    of disciplinary   perspectives   and  how  multidisciplinary
approaches   can  advance    the  learning sciences. This    study  explored  research    practices in the   HRD   and
management disciplines with respect to motivation and transfer. Revisiting the Noe model, it was argued that
the construct `motivation to transfer' needs to be reconceptualized in several significant respectbsefore learning
researchers  should   follow Pugh's    and Bergin's  (2006)    recommendation    to  adopt   motivation to   transfer in
contexts beyond HRD. This study used a multidisciplinary account in that it lied on the confluence of several
literatures. The first is composed of managerial studies onthe application of training to the workplace, including
motivational processes as their central mediator. The second is composed of theoretical accounts ontask and
achievement motivation prominent in educational and social psychologyT. his confluence creates an interesting
tension. It is obvious   in  reading the present  study   that `transfer' is used in  line with  what  Bransford   and
Schwartz (1999) have called the Direct Application theory of transfer.Certainly, there are other perspectives on
transfer prevalent   in  other disciplines  such  as vocational   education   (Tuomi-Gröhn      & Engeström,     2003),
mathematics education (Lehtinen & Hannula, 2006), or computer-supported collaborative learning (Kapur &
Kinzer,  2009). Many     more  could   be  named. The   emphasis    of  the  immediate   use of what   was   learned  in
workplace applications is likely to be a result of the focuson the short-term benefits of training that can be
found in many management and HRD contexts. In line with this view, motivation was seen as a single factor
that can facilitate quick training application. We have criticized this view in the present study as being too
coarse  to  account  for the full complexity  of  intentional   transfer  processes. It  seemed to  us that   a way   to
overcome this problem was to use the best of both disciplines--HRD and learning sciences--to create a new

account on motivation to transfer. Future research will have to show whether the proposed thre-edimensional
model is more successful in predicting transfer than a on-edimensional model.
         This study revisited Noe's (1986) construct motivation to transfer. In a series of CFA analysesi,t was
shown that motivation to transfer has a three-factor structure consisting of autonomous motivation to transfer,
controlled  motivation  to transfer,  and intentions to   transfer. This factor structure  was  built on a  combined
motivation  theory   approach  unifying self-determination    theory   (educational psychology),    expectancy  theory
(management), and the theory of planned behavior (social psychology.) In a PLS-modeled path analysis, the
study showed that social cues influenced controlled motivation, but not autonomous motivation; affectiveuces
had an impact on both autonomous and controlled motivation. Intentions to transfer mediated the effcet of
autonomous motivation on training transfer. Compared to past transfer motivation research, this study tested
several new directions that have theoretical implications. First, the motivational sequence exploreidndicates that
intentional transfer  processes cannot    be captured   with a single   scale; rather motivational   states and  traits
associated  with social  and  affective  cues can  form   an  interdependent   account  of  learner and  environment
(Hickey et al., 2001; Järvelä et al., 2009). This interdependency regulates motivation and has a differentiated
effect on motivation and intention (Vauras et al., 2008). Second, the measurement time three months after
training can be seen as a significant step toward developing an understanding of how motivation toratnsfer is
affected when    the  learner interacts within her/his  routine work     environment,  not  affected  by   the training
condition. More research in the temporal dimension of transfer motivation is needed, however, to ovrecome
what was termed the dynamic problem of motivation to transfer (Gegenufrtner et al., 2009b). There are three
limitations. First, the data consisted of self-report measures only. This was deemed appropriate for this study
because  the  interest was  in the   trainees' subjective  attitudinal,  motivational, and  intentional  perceptions.
However, we are aware of problems associated with leniency and sel-fserving bias that can likely occur in self-
reported material. Second, study implications are constrained by characteristics of the population of trainees in
occupational health education from which the sample was drawn. Third,generalization of the findings is limited
to the time period three months after training. Since motivation to transfer is assumed to be a dynmaic construct,
all relationships explored must be considered with cautoin when generalizing to a different time frame.
