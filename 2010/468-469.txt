        A bstract: This poster focuses on approaches and strategies tied to pedagogy, facilitation,
        and   assistance   employed by   members  of    the Informal   Science  Education (ISE)     and
        Learning  Sciences    (LS)  communities      working    toward informing    understanding    of
        teaching that accounts for the challenges and unique affordances particular to informal
        learning contexts.

Intersections
This poster is part of a collaborative effort1 among Learning Sciences (LS) and Informal Science Education
(ISE) researchers and    practitioners. The authors    discuss  principles that apply across  diverse   settings
compared   to facilitation within constrained settings    whose  dimensions  are more  easily described,   how
"good" pedagogy outside of schools may be defined, what informal facilitator content knowledge might
look like, and productive researcher/practitioner partnerships that can help advance practice, using four
research studies as examples that characterize the application of these principles.

Research Studies
Study #1: Sharing spaces: E xamining the continuum of self-managed and community-managed
learning and engagement in informal science environments
As state and federal agencies in the U.S. increase their commitment to informal science, technology,
engineering, and math (STEM) learning, the role of outreach in STEM learning has come under increasing
scrutiny. LS approaches, including design experimentation, can highlight important aspects of the interplay
between self-managed learning and community-managed learning in STEM outreach programs. However,
it is important to highlight the effect that stakeholder involvement in STEM outreach has on participants'
experiences, not only concerning STEM content learning, but regarding overall satisfaction with the
outreach experience, including outcomes that may not be considered central to learning sciences
approaches to STEM learning. Questions addressed by this study include: How is the viability of a design
experimentation approach to improving STEM outreach affected by programs with an increasing numbers
and kinds of stakeholders, including local, state, and federal agencies?; Does the nature of self-managed
learning change when more (and more powerful) stakeholders are involved?; and Can we adapt best
practices from both ends of the continuum despite the complexities and difficulties of meeting stakeholder
interests?
Study #2: Nonformal Science Learning within a F ramewor k of 4-H Positive Youth Development
This study focuses on pedagogical opportunities and challenges related to nonformal science learning
within 4-H programs. 4-H programs are delivered through the extension offices of land-grant universities
across the United States and serve over 6 million youth ages 8-18. In 2008, National 4-H announced a
commitment to engage 1 million new youth within science, engineering and technology (SET). A recent
report from year five of a longitudinal study by Lerner and colleagues (2009) found that 4-H youth are
more than twice as likely as other youth to be in the highest trajectories of contribution to their
communities and 41% lower on the risk behavior measure than youth who participated in other out-of-
school activities. The study includes a review of abilities targeted within the 4-H program and how these
are situated within the pedagogical structures of positive youth development. The analysis of abilities

presented considers opportunities and challenges of nonformal science learning within the 4-H model and
highlights affordances for learning in the interactions linking youth, adults and educative materials. Case
examples are shared in domains of robotics, GIS/GPS mapping, alternative energy and veterinary science.
Study #3: Astronomical Concepts and A udience Self-Perceptions of Learning and Understanding
Researchers and informal science education practitioners can work together to identify research questions
and design appropriate tools to measure and assess STEM learning, with learning defined as a process of
knowledge acquisition that is constructive in nature. Understanding informal science learning and tapping
into cognitive processes at play during informal educational programs is challenging because of space and
time constraints, but it is known that even brief interactions have had demonstrated impacts (Dunlop, 2000;
Sunal, 1973). This study focuses on informal science learning during 55-minute planetarium shows and

own learning. Findings include that, in general, audiences tend to be overly optimistic in their self-
reporting, and more specifically, while visitors wanted most to learn how to identify constellations, they
felt that finding constellations was the hardest idea discussed. Implications for practice relative to identified
correlations across demonstrated ability, self-perceptions, and demographic information, are discussed.
Study #4: Parent Pedagogy: Digging into Disciplinary T alk
Scientific practices such as observation are disciplinary specific rather than domain general in nature
(Eberbach & Crowley, 2009), and this paper examines how parent disciplinary talk mediates family
scientific observations of biological phenomena. In a controlled study, 79 parent-child pairs observed and
talked about pollination during a visit to a botanical garden. In order to help parents elaborate upon

occurring conversational strategies. To detect evidence of disciplinary talk, a Disciplinary Model that drew
upon philosophy of science (Machamer, Darden, & Craver, 2000), disciplinary content, and emergent
parent-child disciplinary talk was developed. The findings revealed that parents and children who knew
more about pollination at the start of the study had higher levels of disciplinary talk in the garden, as
expected. However, the use of the conversational strategies also increased the amount of disciplinary talk in
the garden, independent of what families knew about pollination. In effect, the use of the four
conversational strategies enabled parents to support more disciplinary talk whether they knew a lot or knew
a little about pollination. These results provide new insights into how parent talk may support science
learning in informal learning environments.

Importance of This Work
This work on pedagogy, facilitation, and assistance builds upon recent work that summarizes what we
know about learning outside of school in science-related fields. The authors, both researchers and
practitioners, apply what we know about teaching in informal science environments to the building of more
inclusive models of STEM learning in the Learning Sciences and the connecting of methods of research
and methods of informal learning practice.
