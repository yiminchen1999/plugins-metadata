          modeling curriculum engaged with a specific scaffold, !"#$ %&'(#)-Evidence Link* (MEL)

Objectives & Theoretical Framework
This poster presents ongoing results from the PRACCIS (Promoting Reasoning And Conceptual Change in
Science) project, a microgenetic investigation of the effectiveness of classroomargumentation around scientific
modeling for promoting learning and reasoning in middle school life-science classes. PRACCIS has explored
ways in which the challenges of developing sophisticated model-based inquiry might be met in instruction.The
effectiveness of scaffolds in promoting authentic, reflective inquiry suggests that they might be the kind of
instructional tool for engendering model-evidence fluency among science students (Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007).
          Previous research by the project team has identified the central evaluative modeling and argumentation
criteria used by students engaged in the PRACCIS research projecthas and tracked changing patterns of criteria
use over the course of the school year (Pluta et al., 2009). Here we investigate the ways in a specific modeling
scaffold served to facilitate and constrain the reasoning and argumentation practices of students.
          A goal of the analyses presented in this brief 3/3#2$1,$ !'$ .21!1./))4$ /,,#,,$ ,!-(#+!,*$ -,#$ '0$ /$ ,./00')($
used prominently in the PRACCIS curriculum5the model-evidence link (MEL) diagram (see Figure 1). This
scaffold is a graphical representational and reasoning tool designed to facilitate the coordinaiton of multiple
pieces  of evidence     in the evaluation   of one  or more    models. When    using the MEL   diagram,   students use
different kinds of arrows to denote different kinds of relationships between evidence and models:supports;
strongly supports; is irrelevant to; or contradicts a model. The scaffold encourages students to present reasons
for particular model-evidence relations and to consider how model-evidence relationships can vary not only in
direction (support versus contradict) but also in strength (e.g,. strongly support versus support). The scaffold
allows  students to     consider multiple   models  against  multiple   pieces of  evidence, each  of  varying   relative
strength.  Accomplishing      this kind  of reasoning presents   multiple difficulties for   students unaccustomed    to
modeling practices, not least due to the cognitive load involved.

Methods and Data Sources
Data are drawn from a yearlong microgenetic study of 16 classes taught by 7 teachers, including a full school
year of class video and small-group audio recordings. Our analyses focused on the use of the scaffold in written
pretest and posttest assessmentsin the classes of four teachers. Additional dataare drawn from written work and
from class and group discourse sampled (a) several weeks before, (b) during and (c) several weeks after the
introduction of the MEL diagrams.
          The data analyzed in this paper come fromtwo separate inquiry investigationsin which MEL diagrams
were embedded, allowing for counterbalanced assessmentof students reasoning. For reasons of space we shall
briefly describe    one    of these5a   problem   in which     students  used  evidence  to  determine  which of    two
explanations of the cause of gastrointestinal ulcers should be preferred. Students considered two models: (a) a
stress model, on which increased tension leads to overproduction of stomach acid which damages the stomach
lining; and (b) a bacteria model, in which bacterial infection results in damage to the stomach linin.gAfter
deciding which model they initially considered better, students were presented with three pieces of evidence: (1)
the pain produced by the action of stomach acid on wounds in the stomach lining; (2) associations between
stressful jobs and ulcers; and (3) the effectiveness of antibiotics (which kill bacteria) on alleviating ulcers.
Students then completed a MEL diagram that presented the models and evidence in a perspicuous form, and
students  justified their    choice  of links  they considered   to  be  the  most important  for   comparative    model
evaluation.

Results and Significance
;!-(#+!,*$8ustifications were coded in several ways. First, according to their degree of elaboration, specifically
in terms  of the nature  of the    link between   the model    and  evidence they   coordinated. H ighly elaborated
justifications, e.g. => because ulcers are commonly found in dangerous jobs, like firefighter, or coal miners>
jobs [that] can be hard on the body causing stress that lead to excessive body acid which causes ulcers? typically
introduced a new element or perspective which served to fit some feature(s) of the evidence with the model.
Low elaboration answers merely asserted the presence of a substantive link, without taking steps to integrate
them in unifying explanation, or simply restated the characteristics of the model and/or evidence. This coding
scheme provides a useful way of delineating high and low quality of reasoning in student responses, as high
levels of creative elaboration is needed to bring apparently disparate models and evidence together in successful
explanation. Creativity and narrative fluency appeared to play an important role1+$,!-(#+!,*$2#/,'+1+:@
         Additional  coding categories    included  various    classes of   factual and  inferential error, including
responses in which the relevance of evidence for a model was missed (e.g., many students judged the antibiotic
evidence as irrelevant to the bacterial model, as it only dealt with the healing of ulcers and notexplicitly with
their causation). Students appear to need to learn strategies that can help them recognize the relevance of such
evidence.

         The MEL diagrams provided students with an intuitiveand simplifying means of representing complex
sets of model-evidence   relations,  and  they supported     collaborative argumentation  about  issues  such as  the

effectively  balance teacher-scaffolded   instruction   and   feedback  with  student-led   inquiry  and  discussion
exhibited a decrease in the non-justificatory responses (that is, responses that failed to provide substantive
reasons for claims). However, the students of teachers who provided less clear scaffolding or dominating the
inquiry discourse in their classrooms increased slightly in their tendency to give non-justificatory responses. It
appears that in the context of this learning scaffold,the instructional styles of teachers may substantively impact
