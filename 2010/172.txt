          A bstract: Design provides a unifying metaphor for describing research across fields of education.
          We propose a design framework as a visual and cognitive representation to unify the discourse of
          educational  researchers,  instructional designers,    teachers, and  policy  makers   by providing  a
          common vocabulary of practice.       An artifact-based design perspective illustrates how education
          research can  be  conducted  to   investigate    intended   design  outcomes, to  critically study  the
          mismatch between stated and unstated intentions and outcomes, and to evaluate studies that trace
          learning outcomes from designed learning interventions.       We then explicate three applications of
          the design framework to different fields of educational inquiry.

Focus of the Symposium
We argue that design provides a unifying metaphor for describing research across fields of education. As education
continues to grow as a field of inquiry, the different research traditions used by educational researchers continue to
fragment the discourse. This presents a considerable problem for researchers who attempt to communicate across
discourses as well as for researchers who seek to communicate research findings to a broader public.         We propose a
design framework    as  a  visual and cognitive    representation   to  unify the discourse  of  educational  researchers,
instructional designers, teachers, and policy makers by providing a common vocabulary of practice.

Significance
Contemporary education researchers explore a remarkable diversity of questions under the guise of educational
research. However, while education departments have become an academic growth industry, educational researchers
continue   to struggle for the professional identity    of their field. Some   writers attempt  to draw  out the  defining
characteristics of the field in terms of research that is truly educational (Ball & Forzani, 2007) or scientific (Slavin,
2002;  Feuer,  Towne,   &  "#$%&'()*+, -..-/0, 12#&3(, #$%&, (425$2&6, 2#&, 783)9'&:;, )<, &65=$24)*$', 3&(&$3=#, 4*, 2#&,
institutional and political culture of education schools (c.f. Levine, 2005; Clifford & Guthrie, 1988, Powell, 1980).
Ellen Lagemann (2002), for example, locates the origins of the fractured identity of educational research in the early
history of the field. Achieving respect for a new field of study in the world of academia led early educational

Many educational researchers latched onto prevailing standards of academic quality in fields such as sociology,
psychology, economics, linguistics, critical theory, or the humanities in order to legitimize their own work. The
search for respect was compounded, according to Lagemann, by the lower status of people attracted to the field of

with the public. The quest for legitimacy often resulted in an uneasy double standard in which mainstream academic
researchers   continued to  question the necessity   of  separate   departments   dedicated to (substandard)  educational
research,  while advocates   of   disciplinary fidelity within   education   zealously  enforced   perceived standards of
methodological rigor. This internal conflict within the field often resulted in the wholesale dismissal of educational
research from legal disputes, policy making or local school governance issues in favor of experts in disciplines
outside of education, and further marginalized educational researchers from participating in public discourse.       The
quest  for  legitimacy  via disciplinary  affiliation   has   dive32&6, &65=$24)*$', 3&(&$3=#&3(, <3):, 78)*6&34*D, B#$2,

          The number of scholars thoughtfully revisiting the identity question indicates the felt need for educational
researchers to understand their work as members of a field. This symposium offers a new approach intended to
revive discussion about what constitutes the distinctive characteristics of education and how these characteristics
might shape educational research.    We consider the idea of re-organizing the educational research discourse around
the concept of design.   We begin by exploring the definition that education is design for learning, and tracing how

                                                      172      ISLS

this definition fits examples   of   education  from    different  fields    of study.  Our    discussion   moves  beyond   the
contemporary discussion of the legitimacy and value of design research as an educational research method.                To that
end, we develop a model to demonstrate how design can be seen as a powerful analytic model for understanding
education.
          We begin by presenting the idea of an artifact, that is, a policy, program, curriculum, assessment, or other
device implemented    to  influence  the  learning  of   others.  Education     is facilitated as teachers  and  learners work
through and with artifacts to shape learning.   Artifact characteristics can be analyzed in two directions ! either from
the perspective of the features that designers build into artifacts to influence learners or from the affordances that
learners perceive as the key characteristics of the artifacts. An artifact-based design perspective illustrates how
education  research  can  be conducted    to  investigate  intended  design     outcomes,   to  critically study the  mismatch
between stated and unstated intentions and outcomes, or to evaluate studies that trace learning outcomes from
designed learning interventions. We also trace how a design-based model can both capture the strength and spirit of
current approaches to educational research and also integrate previously fragmented approaches into a unified model
for educational research.
          Our approach is intended neither to decry the low status of our field nor to elevate one perspective of the
research landscape at the expense of others.     Instead, we hope the design perspective will show how our research
methods   follow from    distinctive characteristics    of our    interests, and   we  will  illustrate how  a   unified design
perspective allows educational researchers to ask new questions that bring educational inquiry into a more mature
state of disciplinary self-sufficiency.

1. A Modest Proposal: A Design Framework to Unify Educational Discourse

                                     Rich Halverson and Erica Rosenfeld Halverson

We begin our discussion of a unifying framework by defining education as design for learning. By understanding
education in terms of designs to influence learning, educational research then becomes about the development,
implementation,  and  study  of artifacts that  influence    learning.   Seen    from  this perspective,   educational research
necessarily draws on methods and theories developed in psychology, sociology, economics, linguistics or neurology,
but the focus on design sets its interests apart from these disciplines and establishes the need for an independent
discourse.
          We propose a framework that centers on a concept of the artifact (Halverson, 2002; 2004). Artifacts can be
policies, programs,  or  pedagogical    tools that individuals    employ     to  promote,   evaluate, or   understand  learning.
Artifacts are the devices or tools implemented to influence action. The concept of artifact plays a central role in a

structures and languages that co-constitute human action (Wertsch, 1998). In common use, artifacts refer to material
things such as pens, computers, cars, or groceries (c.f. Norman, 1991). These products are created for purposes that
address, extend, or transform the practices of others.
          The central analytic concepts involved with artifacts are features and affordances.         Designers build features
into artifacts, and these features reflect the ways that designers hope to influence the thinking and practices of
$324<$=2, 5(&3(0, G&(4D*&3(, =3&$2&, $324<$=2(, B42#, =&32$4*, 4*2&*6&6, 5(&(, 4*, :4*60, H#&E, 74*(=349&;, 4*2&*6&6, 5(&(, 4*2), 2#&,
features of the artifact. A feature is an aspect of an artifact developed to support a possible use.           Light switches,
radio dials, cup handles, and paperclips all have features designed to support intended uses. More abstract artifacts,
such as policies and textbooks, include features such as incentives for compliance and assessments with answer
keys. Affordances, on the other hand, describe the ways that users perceive artifact features.          Affordances reflect the
perceptions, sense making, and pre-conceptions of users. We argue that the gap between artifacts and features,
between intended and actual uses, and between design and implementation, constitutes the field in which most
education research takes place. Artifacts completely enclose the space in which educators work, live, and even think.
While the importance of artifacts are clearest in the context of research in classroom-based learning environments,
artifacts are also central to non-classroom based research such policy research that measures the impact of teacher
pay-for-performance    models   in   school   districts or   essays criticizing    the theoretical  conceptualization    of the
achievement gap.

the original intentions.  In addition, consequences can and should be used to inform future designs, whether these are
iterations of the present design or new design innovations.
          And finally, the entire design framework is subject to the critical perspective, which sets the design within
a sociocultural and historical framework.     The critical perspective allows us to analyze how the implementations of
designs are products of social and political contexts, how schools use designs to effectively (if unintentionally)
reproduce dominant cultural ideologies, and how the positionality of designers can significantly affect the design
process and, therefore,   the potential success of implementation.      When  we consider    education as design for learning,
educational artifacts are ubiquitous and, consequently, the design framework serves as a visual representation for
multiple aspects of the domain of education.
          Artifacts provide   occasions for tracing how      practices  occur and  evolve.     By studying how artifacts are
developed and used in educational contexts, researchers can not only observe how teaching and learning changes,
but they can also investigate practices prior to alteration. Much of educational research can be characterized as
advocacy research in which a group promotes a particular method/artifact/program as a viable path to changed
practice. A design-based perspective can reveal how artifacts might change practices and also shed light on the
practices  that artifacts intend  to  change.   Artifact design   and   use  can be    analyzed as  a  form of  asynchronous
communication between designers at every level, from policy makers to local school curriculum creators, and the
practitioners who work with artifacts.
          The   potential for  understanding  education   as    design  for  learning  comes   from the  ways   in which   this
imperfect method of communication fails, iterates, compounds, or is exapted by the circumstances of practice. A
design perspective illustrates the four key occasions in which artifact design allows for investigating education: 1)
translation of intention into artifact features; 2) the perception of features as affordances; 3) impact of affordances on
practice; and 4) the relation of the artifact design/implementation cycle in a wider institutional, social, and political
contexts.

Applications of the Design Framework
We will present three applications of the design framework to different fields of educational inquiry.               The first
focuses on how the design framework can be used to encourage collaboration between classroom teachers and
researchers.    The second     contemplates  the  design  framework     as   an  organizational   tool for understanding     the

practices of youth media arts organizations.  The final examines the mismatch between features and affordances as a
path toward understanding the implementation of a large-scale instructional policy.

2. Using the Design Framework as a Metarepresentation to Facilitate Teacher-Researcher
Collaboration

Often, when   one educational  design fails, the response       is to  try another design rather than closely inspect  the

perspective on classroom curricular interventions may inform subsequent iterations of the design, which can benefit
teachers, researchers, and students alike. Our theoretical work draws from the field of participatory design research
to highlight the need for the utilization of the design framework as a metarepresentation to foster collaboration
between teachers and researchers. Furthermore, it highlights six ways in which the design        framework can be applied
throughout the process of planning educational innovations to minimize disconnects that may occur between design,
implementation, and iteration.
        Metarepresentations allow individuals to more readily perceive and comprehend patterns that the unaided

7:&*2$', (8$=&;, <)3, #4D#&3, )36&3, 2#4*I4*D, @O)3:$n, 1994).     Several researchers in the participatory research field
advocate for the use of a tool, such as a metarepresentation, to address perspectives of all members of a design team
(Arias, Eden, Fischer, Gorman, & Scharff, 2000; Blomberg, Suchman, & Trigg, 1996; Kankainen, 2003; Maguire,
2001; Veryzer & Borja de Mozota, 2005).     With this in mind, we suggest that the design framework will function as
both a visual  and a temporal   metarepresentation  to      illuminate  the  design  process. As  Edelson (2002)  notes,
7P*D$D4*D, 4*, 6&(4D*, $(, $, 3&(&$3=#, 83)=&((, :&$*(, 2$I4*D, 2#&, &'&:&*2(, )<, 6&(4D*, 2#$2, 2E84=$''E, 3&:$4*, 4:8'4=42, 4*,

facilitate productive interactions between teachers and researchers by explicating the entire process of educational
research by serving as a metarepresentation.
        We envision the design framework as having six specific applications within educational research: 1) as a
visual tool to elucidate research design and development to all constituents involved in the design process, 2) a co-
planning tool, 3) as a reference point for reflection during design implementation, 4) as a means to summatively
assess the effectiveness of the research design and its implementation, 5) as a tool to re-envision the design for
future iterations, and 6) as a means to record the intentions, implementations, and outcomes of the design process
over multiple iterations. We conceptualize each of these six applications as a way to promote communication and
collaboration between  teachers   and  researchers  during         the design   process manifesting   greater fidelity in
implementation and resulting in enhanced educational outcomes. Additionally, we believe that the design framework
as a metarepresentation can be used to examine policies and craft interventions by deconstructing the design process
after it occurs, in order to understand disconnects or implementation issues.

3. Artifact Families: An Affordance of the Design Framework

                                                   Michelle Bass

The design framework affords us the opportunity to see sameness and difference between similar artifacts.          Many
artifacts share similar, or sometimes identical, components which include features, intentions, and stated outcomes.
Here, I present the idea of artifact families as a way to organize and describe artifacts that share design framework
components.
        The structure for the idea of organizing artifacts into families comes from the field of organization studies.
Organization studies researchers are starting to explore positioning their work as a science for design+,B#4=#,7puts

        bringing our diverse interests together in a search for more desirable states of (organizational) affairs. (p.
        317-318)
The idea of isolation of specialists is true amongst researchers who study youth media arts organizations (YMAOs).
YMAOs vary by participant demographics, geographic location, types of media produced, mentorship practices, and
many other features.  The complex variety of possible feature combinations results in difficulty comparing across
organizations. Despite this fact, researchers continue discussing YMAOs as one type of artifact.    I provide a worked
example of organizing YMAOs into artifact families.      This discussion begins with a critique regarding the field of
:5'24:&64$, '42&3$=E?(, )%&3'E, (4:8'4<4&6, =):8$34()*, )<, $'', %$34&24&(, )<, Z[F1(, 2), 63$B, )%&3$3=#4*D, =)*='5(4)*(,

similarities and differences that make each a unique member of the identity film focused YMAO family.            I also
propose the idea of creating cross family memberships for IFF members by adding to their intentions and features,
looking (8&=4<4=$''E, $2, #)B, 2#&(&, 83)D3$:(, =)5'6, <)=5(, )*, (&3%4*D, $(, $, 84&=&, )<, 2#&43, $6)'&(=&*2, 8$324=48$*2?(,
transition process to college.
        Identity film  focused   youth media  arts organizations     are one of  many  artifact families in the field of
educational research.  The idea of artifact families should not be conceived of as revolutionary or subversive.
Rather, I hope that using the frame of science for design from the field of organization studies can help make
discussions of artifacts in the field of education more understandable and less ambiguous.

4. Branching Up, Out or Off:           How Features Become Affordances

                                                    Anne Karch

I look at the section of the design framework between intentions and consequences, where the designed features of
the artifact become affordances, or not, in the use or operation of that artifact. I suggest that the process by which
artifact users afford themselves of its features is an organic one in which emergent uses can sprout and grow from
the original designed features.  I offer the metaphor of a tree and its branches for this process and show how the
design framework gives us a closer view of the mismatch between features and affordances than in fidelity of
implementation analysis.
        The artifact I examine is a policy for educational reform:       the Wisconsin Student Achievement Guarantee
in Education (SAGE) program, which is in place in over 500 elementary schools across the state. The design for this
program is laid out in Wisconsin state law with the intention of increasing the levels of academic achievement of

researchers have found that SAGE does not look the same in each of the schools, even within the same district or
sometimes across grades in the same school.   A fidelity of implementation analysis would look at the enactment of
"F^P+,(&$3=#4*D,<)3,B$E(,42,#$6,*)2,9&&*,76)*&,34D#2;,$2,2he low performing schools (Firestone, Fitz, & Broadfoot,
1999;  Lee, Penfield, &  Maerten-Rivera,   2009; O'Donnell,     2008;  Spillane, Reiser, &  Reimer,   2002).  A  design
approach requires us to look first at the policy itself to see intentions, and then examine how its features are seen as
affordances and whether those affordances still match the intentions (Norman, 1994; Spillane et al., 2002).
I consider each of the four features of SAGE, plus the fifth feature of funding, looking at its designed intent, the
affordance(s) or perceived affordances it offers, and the way it is appropriated by the users, highlighting mismatches
between intent and affordance where they occur.    Then, using the tree metaphor, I trace the branching growth of the
feature as schools afford themselves of it, sometimes causing more branches to grow up or out, sometimes breaking
off.  Where there is a matc#, 9&2B&&*, $, <&$253&?(, 4*2&*24)*(, $*6, $<<)36$*=&(+, 2#&3&, 4(, D3)B2#0, , R#&*, 2#&3&, 4(, $,
mismatch, the branch breaks off, although the user may adapt it for another purpose.     I also show how the interaction
between affordances, like interlocking tree branches, can lead to more vigorous growth.      For education policy, the

design framework allows for detailed analysis of what happens between intentions and outcomes and offers the
possibility of fine tuning, through the recursive process of redesign, of features to create better matches between
intentions and affordances.

Implications
We argue that the design framework can facilitate the examination of the design and implementation of educational
initiatives by supporting cognition, communication, reflection, and generative questioning across space and time. By
tracing the    design process   from   its inception to  its   implementation    and  through  its evaluation  and  subsequent
iterations, we    will suggest    that   policy   makers,   researchers,    educational  leaders,  and   teachers   can  clearly
communicate their goals and needs to each other while working to increase the fidelity of reform initiatives. In
addition, by integrating users (and their experiences) into the design process early on, real-world practices can
inform an iterative design process, leading to greater faithfulness in enacting the intentions of the artifact.
         We believe that the design framework can be used to communicate and explicate educational initiatives to
all  stakeholders,    including   superintendents,   principals,    community     members,   parents,    and  teachers.  In this
symposium,     we  look  specifically    at three  examples:      educational  interventions that  involve   teacher-researcher
collaboration, a youth media arts organization, and an intervention program for low-income elementary students. In
each, we note that, on a very basic level, designs or reforms are often unsuccessful due to what Bernstein (1990)
refers to as problems with recontextualization. In this model, researchers in any domain in academia work in a
primary context, concerned mainly with the construction of new knowledge and the production of particular types of
discourse. Those who make decisions about what takes place in schools, a secondary context, make judgments about
what discourse and knowledge, produced within the primary context, is important to teach as well as how this
information should be taught. In other words, those who make decisions about what is important for student to
know, such as text book writers, policy makers, arts organization leaders, government officials, and superintendents,
recontextualize what has been produced in the primary context for use in the secondary context.
         When policy makers and designers designate schools and teachers who have not been privy to the design
process as the agents of implementation, disconnects between the intentions of the innovation and actual school and
classroom enactments often occur. To alleviate problems such as this, several researchers have advocated for the
development of overarching representations to facilitate intersubjectivity (Arias, Eden, Fischer, Gorman, & Scharff,
2000; Blomberg, Suchman, & Trigg, 1996; Kankainen, 2003; Maguire, 2001; Veryzer & Borja de Mozota, 2005).
Using   the design    framework    as  a   metarepresentation     for the  field of education, the   papers   presented  in this
symposium focus on investigating the issues of fidelity of educational policy initiatives and the coordination and
organization of ideas to minimize the disconnects that can occur. We suggest that, as a metarepresentation, the
design framework can serve three key purposes.         First, it can be used as a tool to understand the design process; in
this way,   it can be  useful   to those    who   work   to plan,   create, and  implement   reform   initiatives.  The  design
framework can be invaluable for individuals who seek to research teaching and learning, and it can offer an analytic,
research-based perspective on the process as it occurs.        Second, the design framework can also be used as a way to
understand how to examine policies and craft interventions, and it can offer perspective on the process of making
and  implementing     policy. Lastly,  it  offers a way     to deconstruct   the  design process   after it occurs, in  order to
understand the resulting disconnects or implementation issues.
