         Abstract:    Collaborative   inquiry   learning   can   be regarded    as a fruitful   approach   to foster
         students' scientific literacy for participation in societal debates involving scientific issues. In a
         four-week     field  study  in  biology    with   131   ninth-grade    students    from   six classrooms
         distributed over three experimental conditions, we investigated the effects of a continuous and
         a  fading    collaboration  script   for  collaborative    online   search  compared      to  unsupported
         collaboration    on  students'    online   search    competence     and    domain-specific    knowledge.
         Findings indicate a superiority of a continuous collaboration script compared to unsupported
         collaboration   with  respect  to both   students'   online search   competence    and    domain-specific
         knowledge, whereas the fading collaboration script had a significant positive effect compared
         to unsupported collaboration only with respect to students' online search competence. These
         findings extend our knowledge from laboratory research on effects of collaboration scripts on
         domain-general competences and domain-specific knowledge.

Scientific literacy as a goal of science education in schools
A main   purpose   of science  education    is not  so  much   to educate    future  scientists or engineers,    but rather to
prepare all students as responsible citizens for participation in societal debates that involve scientific issues.
Current examples of such issues are the prospects and risks of nuclear power, the genetic engineering of crops
and other plants for purposes of food production, or preimplantation genetic diagnosis.
         For  the  development    of reasoned   positions   about   these  questions,   scientific literacy   is an  important
prerequisite   (Laugksch,    2000),  which     involves  both    fundamental     knowledge      about  important     scientific
principles and the ability to gather and evaluate more specific and recent information that goes beyond what can
ever  be learned   in school.  Current   information    and   communication      technology   has  made    such   information
widely accessible. Accordingly, we regard domain-specific scientific knowledge, i. e. knowledge of basic terms,
knowledge of important facts and understanding of fundamental explanatory principles, as well as online search
competence,    i. e. the ability to  localize  and  evaluate   relevant scientific   information   on  the   internet, as two
crucial components of scientific literacy that all students should develop in order to be able to participate in
tomorrow's science-related societal debates. To develop instruments for measuring and support for fostering
online search competence, we conducted a cognitive task analysis of internet search tasks which ask learners to
use the internet to gather evidence they could use to formulate arguments in societal, science-related debates
(see  Kollar, Wecker     &  Fischer, 2009).   Following    that, we  validated   the resulting   model    of  competence    by
asking an online search expert, a content expert and a search novice to think aloud during such tasks. Most
importantly,   the think  aloud  study  showed     that both   experts, after   having  built   an initial argument    sketch,
established a scheme for what counted as evidence to support their position and let this evidence scheme guide
their internet search    behaviour.  The   novice,  in  contrast,   browsed   through   the internet   in  a  rather mindless
fashion, not much really taking care of relevance, credibility or scientific quality of web site content, finally
arriving at less sound arguments that were supported by less reliable information found on the Web.

Collaborative inquiry learning as an approach to foster scientific literacy
Scientific literacy and its sub-components domain-specific knowledge and online search competence can be
fostered in inquiry learning contexts (e.g., de Jong, 2006), which are implemented with the aid of digital media
and internet technologies that afford collaboration between students (see Slotta & Linn, 2000). In web-based
inquiry  learning,   students use computer     and  internet  technologies    (usually  in  groups)   to  work   on  authentic
scientific  phenomena    or  problems   in a  way  similar  to   scientists. It can  be argued   that  by  engaging    in such
activities, scientific literacy may be developed, since they typically involve elaborating upon domain-specific
scientific knowledge and using digital media to gather evidence, which may foster online search competence.
         As empirical evidence shows, however, for inquiry learning to be productive, it needs to be structured
and scaffolded appropriately (de Jong & van Joolingen, 1998). Therefore, web-based environments include a
variety  of scaffolds  designed   to facilitate students'   inquiry  processes.    For  example,   the   Web-based     Inquiry
Science  Environment     (WISE;   Slotta   &  Linn, 2000)   includes  hint   questions  designed    to trigger   elaborations,
mapping tools to visualize the relations between multiple variables, or background information on the given

science problem. As an analysis of WISE and several other web-based inquiry learning environments shows,
however, most environments lack support that directly aims at scaffolding the collaboration process between the
learning partners. Against the background of empirical research on collaborative learning, which shows that
collaboration rarely reaches high quality when it happens spontaneously (Gillies, 2003), the use of scaffolds
directed at an improvement of collaboration seems to be warranted.

Collaboration scripts to support collaborative inquiry learning
One promising     way   of providing   such support is to   develop  collaboration   scripts  (Kollar, Fischer &  Hesse,
2006;    Dillenbourg   &   Jerman,   2007)  and   integrate them    into  web-based     inquiry learning   environments.
Collaboration scripts are socio-cognitive scaffolds that specify activities, sequence them and distribute them
among different roles taken over by members of a small group of learners (Kollar et al., 2006).
         Despite some research about the effects of collaboration scripts on learning processes (e. g. De Wever,
Van Keer,   Schellens   &  Valcke,   2009), their effects   on learning   outcomes   have  been  investigated  mainly  in
laboratory  experiments.     Several lab  studies about   computer-supported      collaborative  learning  during online
discussions    in a  problem-based     learning   context   demonstrated     beneficial effects  of different  kinds   of
collaboration   scripts on   students' domain-general    competencies     (Weinberger,  Ertl, Fischer  &   Mandl, 2005;
Stegmann, Weinberger & Fischer, 2007). However, only for some types of computer-supported collaboration
scripts, e.g., a  peer-review script,  beneficial effects with    respect to  the domain-specific   knowledge  could  be
found (Weinberger et al., 2005; Diziol, Rummel, Spada & Mclaren, 2007). In the context of web-based inquiry
learning, a collaboration script aimed at helping students to form well-grounded arguments, counterarguments
and integrations was developed and integrated at specific points of as WISE curriculum unit (Kollar, Fischer &
Slotta, 2007). In line with previous research, this script helped students develop higher levels of the domain-
general competence of argumentation, but did not help them reach higher levels of domain-specific knowledge
when compared with less structured collaboration. Moreover, it appeared that during the learning process the
collaboration   script  only raised  argumentation  quality    as long as  it was   present. As soon   as the script was
"switched off", learners relapsed into their previous argumentation style. In other words, internalization of the
argumentation strategy was low, which may be explained by a rather short learning time of 120 minutes. The
question whether computer-supported collaboration scripts produce more robust effects when longer learning
phases are studied is yet unanswered.

The fading of collaboration scripts
The laboratory research mentioned clearly indicates a need for finding ways to support the internalization of
strategies targeted by collaboration scripts. One such approach is the fading of support, which is considered as
part and parcel of scaffolding (Pea, 2004; Wood, Bruner & Ross, 1976). Up to now research on the effects of
the fading is sparse, and the results are mixed. In one of two experiments, evidence for beneficial effects of
fading was found, whereas in the other one performance decreased in the process of fading (Leutner, 2000). In a
second study a marginally significant positive effect of fading was demonstrated with respect to only one of
several aspects of knowledge about the principles of scientific explanations (McNeill, Lizotte, Krajicik & Marx,
2006). No effect of fading on the quality of explanations in the posttest was found in a further study, while
during the learning phase the quality of explanations decreased in the process of fading (Lee & Songer, 2004).
         An empirical study about the effects of the !"#$%&'(!')*+$,-) showed that fading alone had no positive
effect on learning (Wecker & Fischer, 2007). If it was combined with "distributed monitoring" (cf. King, 1998),
i. e. when the learning partner was asked to monitor whether his or her peer complied with the strategy induced
by the script, a significant positive effect on students' strategy knowledge in comparison to a continuous script
was found. However, this study was also conducted as a lab experiment with a rather short learning time.

Research questions
The summary of the current state of research provided above warrants further consideration whether the effects
of small-group     collaboration  scripts  as  well as   their  fading    show   up  also in  real  science classrooms.
Furthermore, it needs to be investigated whether collaboration scripts as well as their fading can foster also
domain-specific knowledge, if more extended learning phases are implemented. The opportunity to shift the
focus from the application of a domain-general strategy targeted by the collaboration script to the elaboration of
domain-specific content to be learned during longer learning phases would warrant such expectations.
         Accordingly, our research questions were the following:
         (1) What are the effects of a small-group collaboration script as well as its fading on students' domain-
specific knowledge?
         We    expected  that in  classroom-based   inquiry    learning  over  a  comparably    extended  period of  time
domain-specific    knowledge   is  fostered if  collaboration  is  supported   by  a collaboration  script  compared  to
collaboration without a collaboration script. According to the line of reasoning just presented, a beneficial effect
of a fading collaboration script on students' domain-specific knowledge could also be expected.

         (2) What are the effects of a small-group collaboration script as well as its fading on students' online
search competence?
         In line with the bulk of previous findings about the effects of small-group collaboration scripts from the
laboratory we   assumed   a   positive effect  of a  collaboration   script compared   to   collaboration  without  a
collaboration script on students' online search competence. We further hypothesized that a fading collaboration
script would have a beneficial effect on students' online search competence compared to both collaboration
without a collaboration script and collaboration supported by a continuous collaboration script.

Method

Participants and design
The participants were 131 students from six ninth-grade classes from three urban high schools. They were on
average 14.7 years old (./ = 0.75); 53 of them were girls, 78 were boys. The decision to participate in the
project rested with the biology teachers of the classes. However, data from the individual students were only
collected if their parents had agreed individually.
         Three experimental conditions differing in the amount of instructional support for collaborative online
search were  compared in    a one-factorial quasi-experimental     design with  the classes as the units  of random
assignment. The first condition involved no collaboration script, the second a continuous collaboration script,
and the third a fading collaboration script (see table 1).

Curriculum unit and instructional setting
The study was conducted in the context of an inquiry-based curriculum unit that spanned seven regular biology
lessons, which were preceded and followed by one test session each (see table 2). During the unit, the students
were supposed to arrive at a decision about whether they supported or rejected "green" Genetic Engineering, i.
e. the genetic modification of plants for the purpose of food production. All lessons in this curriculum unit were
led by the regular biology teachers of the participating classes.

         The unit started with a short introduction to relevant background domain knowledge from Genetics. To
keep the information about    the strategy  of online   search to  be  acquired constant, the  students  in  all three
conditions also received the same introduction to this strategy.

         Lessons two through seven consisted of three consecutive learning cycles about three different topical
aspects of the discussion about "green" Genetic engineering: one on economic, one on ecological, and one on
health aspects. Each cycle consisted of three consecutive steps. First, the students were asked to collaboratively
browse   through an   online library  in  dyads   in  order  to  gather background     information   about Genetics   and
Genetic Engineering relevant to the current topical aspect of the discussion. In the second step, student dyads
conducted collaborative   online   searches   to support,  discard  or  modify   their initial argument   concerning   the
current topical aspect of the discussion according to the strategy they were introduced to before. In these phases
of collaborative online search, which took place in lessons three, five and seven, the independent variable was
manipulated (see below). In the third step, the teacher led a plenary discussion in which students exchanged
their elaborated arguments based on the findings from their collaborative online searches.
         Students collaborated face-to-face sitting next to each other. The technical equipment both to access
the online library and conduct the online searches comprised a wireless network and one laptop computer with a
mouse per student. The students kept these computers throughout the time of each lesson and received the same
computer each time, which served two purposes: On the one hand, students were enabled to create documents
and to revisit or edit them in later sessions; on the other hand, this procedure facilitated data collection in that it
was easy to track which student had worked on which computer.
         The online library was implemented as a module in the Web-Based Inquiry Environment (WISE). It
comprised three pages with assignments for the three topical aspects of the discussion (economic, ecological
and health aspects) and six sections about topics from Genetics and Genetic Engineering designed on the basis
of regular ninth-grade Biology school books.
         During the collaborative online search phases, the browsers of the collaborating students in each dyad
were connected via a software tool named S-COL (Wecker et al., 2009). This allowed for collaborative internet
browsing, i.e., during their online searches, both learning partners from each dyad always saw the same web
pages, no matter who of them clicked on a link or performed a web search.

Independent variables
The amount    of instructional support    for collaborative     online search was  varied   among    a condition without
collaboration script,  a condition    with  a    continuous   collaboration   script,  and  a  condition  with a  fading
collaboration script.

No collaboration script
In this condition, the browsers of the two students in each dyad were connected as described. These students
received no support beyond the teacher's introduction to the strategy of online search at the beginning of the
curriculum unit. This information was equivalent to the information presented in the collaboration scripts in the
other two conditions.

Continuous collaboration script
In addition to connecting the computers of the two partners of a dyad, the S-COL software tool described above
was used in the two experimental conditions to display particular prompts on the basis of the type of website the
students were accessing (Google start page, Google hit list, any other web site).
         In each dyad there were two roles (A and B) that switched after returning to Google (which they were
required to use  for  their searches)  from   any  other  web    page  encountered    during   the search activities. The
collaboration script was implemented as complementary text prompts in the scaffolding areas of S-COL in the
browsers of both  group   members    (see  left  part of  the   screen in figure 1).  The  script  contained prompts   for
helping students formulate an initial argument and sketch the information needed, select search terms, evaluate
the hit list, localize relevant information on a web page, and write the final elaborated argument. For example,
during the selection of search terms, learner A was prompted to suggest a set of terms and discuss them with B,
while B  had  the  task  to  first recall the  information    they had    decided to   look  for,  and comment   on   A's
suggestions for the search terms with respect to their likelihood of yielding suitable as well as inappropriate hits.

Fading collaboration script
In the condition with the fading collaboration script the same prompts as in the condition with the continuous
collaboration script were used to support collaborative online search, but they were gradually removed (faded
out) over the whole extension of the curriculum unit depending on the number of online searches the students
had performed. After a series of four external web sites accessed, the prompts described before became more
unspecific: Initially, the scaffolding area of S-COL contained both the names of the individual steps as well as
explanatory text. In the second fading phase, only the names of the steps were displayed. In the final phase, only
headings for the actual activity were displayed.

Procedure
The procedure of the study was as follows (see table 2): The biology lesson immediately before the start of the
instructional unit was  used for  a 45-minute  pre-test   for online   search competence, domain  knowledge   and
control variables. The following phase was constituted by the seven lessons described above, distributed over a
period of three and a half weeks. This phase included the manipulation of the independent variable in lessons
three, five and seven. In the biology lesson immediately following the instructional unit, a 45-minute post-test
was conducted, which included online search competence, domain knowledge and further control variables.

Dependent variables

Domain-specific knowledge
Domain-specific knowledge was measured in the post-test by a test that consisted of 18 items about Genetics
and Genetic    Engineering.  One   third  of them   covered   knowledge    about  concepts, another third   factual
knowledge and another third understanding of explanatory relations. The items from these three subscales were
evenly distributed  over different  types of answering    format  (six multiple  choice, twelve open). A  six-item
version of the test with precisely the same structure was used to measure domain-specific knowledge in the pre-
test. The answers to the items with an open answering format were analyzed with respect the occurrence of
propositions taken from an extremely elaborate expert solution that contained any correct proposition that could
conceivably be part of a student's solution For each of these propositions it was coded whether the student's
answer contained it or not. Three coders coded 10 % of the material independently of each other to assess the
objectivity of the analysis. The average percentage of agreement with respect to the different coding variables
was 98 %; Cohen's kappa amounted to ! =.94 on average. For each item from the test the proportion of the
propositions  that were  included  in the student's answer    was  determined   (values  between 0 and  1). These
proportions as well as the scores from the multiple-choice items were summed up across the different items,
yielding an overall scale for #(;"$%=),7*$!$*'>%(?17#&7 ranging from 0 to 18 with a reliability of Cronbach's !
= 59). Three subscales ranging from 0 to 6 for >%(?17#&7'"2(4-'*(%*7,-), !"*-4"1'>%(?17#&7 and 4%#7+)-"%#$%&
are also used in the statistical analyses. Due to the highly elaborated nature of the underlying expert solution,
even low scores indicate substantial knowledge.

Online search competence
Online search competence was measured by a task in which the students were asked to describe in as much
detail as possible how they would use the internet to form a position about a specific sample issue without
actually doing so.  In the pre-test,  the sample  issue the   students  could use  for their description    was whether
mobile   phone transmitters should    be  forbidden  in the   neighbourhood   of   day nurseries. In   the post-test, the
corresponding issue was whether nuclear power plants should be abandoned. The answers were pre-structured
by means of a two-column table of up to eight rows. The left-hand column was to be used for the description of
the single steps involved in the search, whereas the right-hand column was to be used for the description of the
evaluative criteria to be applied in combination with the specific steps. Both pre- and post-test were coded for
the occurrence of each individual element of a general expert solution that contained all the steps as well as all
the evaluative criteria from the strategy explained to the students in all three conditions in the introduction and
suggested by   the collaboration script   in the  conditions  with continuous  or   fading  collaboration   scripts.  The
average percentage of agreement with respect to the different coding items was 96 %; Cohen's kappa amounted
to ! =.65 on average. An overall scale for (%1$%7' )7"+*<' *(;,7-7%*7 was formed by counting the positively
coded variables, with a reliability of Cronbach's ! = .57. Separate scales for >%(?17#&7'"2(4-')$%&17')-7,) and
>%(?17#&7'"2(4-'7:"14"-$(%'*+$-7+$" were also formed (with some coding items excluded from both subscales).
As in the case of domain-specific knowledge, even low scores indicate considerable amounts of competence due
to the complexity of the underlying expert solution.

Statistical analysis
         The significance level was set to 5 % for all analyses. All analyses of variance or covariance were
conducted with the manipulated instructional support as one independent factor and the classrooms as a further
independent factor nested within the experimental conditions. The covariates used were significantly correlated
with the dependent variables.

Results

Research question 1: Effects of a small-group collaboration script and its fading on
students' domain-specific knowledge
With respect to the effects of the two collaboration script versions on students' domain-specific knowledge,
analyses of covariance were conducted with the overall domain-specific knowledge scale and the subscales for
knowledge about concepts, factual knowledge and understanding as dependent variables, classes nested within
the three kinds of instructional support as well as the kind of instructional support as independent variables, and
the overall domain-specific prior knowledge as a covariate. As can be seen from table 3, with respect to all four
dependent  measures    students from  the  condition  with  the continuous    collaboration  script outperformed     both
students from the condition without a collaboration script and from the condition with the fading collaboration
script. A significant main effect of the kind of instructional support was detected for the overall scale of domain-
specific knowledge (5(2; 124) = 7.66; , < .01; partial "@ = .11), which amounts to a medium to large effect. A
planned comparison between the condition without a collaboration script and the condition with a continuous
collaboration script was significant, 5(1; 72) = 5.49; , = .02; partial "@ = .07. The planned contrast between the
condition without a collaboration script and the fading collaboration script did not reach significance in the
expected direction, 5(1; 92) = 2.64; , = .11; partial "@ = .03.
         Further analyses revealed that the detected effect of the kinds of instructional support is due to parallel
patterns of significant  effects   of approximately     medium   size   in all three   subscales    of domain-specific
knowledge:  knowledge    about   concepts,   5(2; 124) = 4.54;  , = .01;   partial "@ = .07, factual   knowledge,    5(2;
124) = 3.27; , = .04; partial "@ = .05, and understanding, 5(2; 124) =     4.98; , = .01; partial "@ = .07.
         With  respect to  one  of the   scales  of domain-specific    knowledge,   knowledge     about concepts,    also
substantial between-classroom variance was found (5(3; 124) = 4.27; , = .01; partial "@ = .09) which may be
caused by factors beyond our experimental conditions, e.g. the teacher's behaviour or the class climate.

Research question 2: Effects of a small-group collaboration script and its fading on
students' online search competence
         With respect to students' online search competence, analyses of covariance were conducted with the
overall online search competence scale and the subscales for knowledge about single steps and knowledge about
evaluation criteria as dependent variables, classes nested within the three kinds of instructional support as well
as the kind of instructional support as independent variables, and the overall prior online search competence as a
covariate. Table 4 shows that descriptively students in the two conditions with the continuous and the fading
collaboration script outperformed students in the condition without a collaboration script on the overall online

search  competence     scale as  well  as the  two  subscales    knowledge   about      single steps and  knowledge    about
evaluation criteria. The main effect of the kinds of instructional support with respect to the overall scale was
significant and    of medium    size, 5(2;   124) = 5.16;  ,   = .01;  partial  "@ = .08.   Both  the planned   comparison
between   the  continuous    collaboration   script  and   no  collaboration    script,  5(1;  72) = 9.97;  , < .01;   partial
"@ = .12, and the planned comparison between the fading collaboration script and no collaboration script, 5(1;
92) = 7.17;   , = .01;  partial "@ = .07, were    significant.   However,   the   final planned  comparison    between    the
fading collaboration script and the continuous collaboration script was not significant, 5(1; 83) < 1; , = .81;
partial "@ < .01.

         Further analyses demonstrated that the significant effect with respect to the overall scale is due only to
an effect of the kinds of instructional support on knowledge about single steps, 5(2; 124) = 5.49; , = .01; partial
"@ = .08. There is no significant corresponding effect with respect to knowledge about evaluation criteria, 5(2;
124) < 1; , = .41; partial "@ = .01.
         With   respect  to  all  scales  of  online search    competence,     i. e.  the overall   scale of online    search
competence (5(3; 124) = 4.19; , = .01; partial "@ = .09) as well as the subscales of knowledge about single steps
(5(3; 124) = 2.96; , = .04; partial "@ = .07) and knowledge about evaluation criteria (5(3; 124) = 3.42; , = .02;
partial "@ =  .08), however,    there was  also   substantial  between-classroom      variance   corresponding  to  medium
effect sizes.

Discussion
The results indicate that the collaboration script approach (Kollar et al., 2006) could successfully be transferred
to structure   web-based     collaborative   inquiry learning    in   real secondary      school classrooms.   Indeed,    the
collaboration script was powerful enough to lead learners to higher levels of both domain-specific knowledge
and online search competence than unsupported collaboration. Probably, the script helped learners to engage in
higher-level internet search processes and also to show a deeper elaboration of the domain-specific information
provided   in  the  online project  library.  Possibly,  the   high-level  evaluation    of information   prompted     by the
collaboration script raised the learners' awareness of the need to produce arguments of a high domain-specific
quality so  that   they could   stand  during  the  plenary    discussions,  which    may   have  contributed   to  a  deeper
elaboration of domain-specific information that could be found online.
         With respect to the effectiveness of the fading of the collaboration script, however, results are mixed: It
did not add to the positive effects of the continuous script on students' online search competence, and did not
even lead   to better   results with  respect  to domain-specific     knowledge    than   the  unstructured  control   group.
Obviously, fading alone does not seem to be enough to foster the internalization of a search strategy but very
likely needs to be combined with further instructional support (cf. Wecker & Fischer, 2007). For example, it
might be helpful to have the teacher from time to time model crucial steps of the search process in front of the
whole   class  (see Rosenshine    &   Meister, 1994),   so that  the  students    are reminded   of  the  strategy the script
presented before it is faded (which we are currently investigating in a follow-up study).
         Finally, it deserves mention that on most dependent measures we found considerable variance between
classes. Thus, further aspects of the learning situation (such as teaching style or class climate) definitely have an

impact  on  the success   or failure of   collaboration scripts  in web-based    collaborative   inquiry learning.  Future
research should clarify what classroom variables influence students' learning outcomes.
