          used smartphones on a one-device-per-person basis to capture photos of the real-life contexts
          pertaining to the idioms,  and to  construct   sentences   with  them.   Subsequently,   in-class or
          online discussions took place, which would enhance the students' understanding in the proper
          usage of the idioms. The learning design is grounded in the seamless learning model that
          encompass in-class formal learning and out-of-class informal setting, and personal and social
          learning spaces.  The  students'  ongoing,   open-ended,     personal-to-social   meaning    making
          process and artifacts have indeed shown some indicators of "seamless language learning" that
          has the potential of transforming language learning into an authentic learning experience.

          This paper reports on a pilot study of Mobile Assisted Language Learning (MALL) in Nan Chiau
Primary   School  in Singapore.  In the study, we   facilitated a 5th  Grade  class   to study and apply    29 common
Chinese idioms, within the context of learning Chinese as a Second Language (L2). Apart from in-class idiom
lessons with contextualized learning activities, the students were assigned with a smartphone each which they
kept and  accessed   24x7  throughout   the nine-week   period  of   the  study. They    were  instructed to   carry out
photoblogging-like activities by using their smartphones to take photos in their daily lives, and then make
sentences with the learned idioms, and subsequently to post them onto a wiki space for sharing and peer review.
          The MALL design emphasizes students' proactive association of the contexts that they encounter in the
real world with the learned Chinese idioms (a special form of vocabulary). In this paper, we focus on studying
the students' individual-to-social  learning process,  which    could  be  attributed  to the  process of   multimodal,
student artifact-focused, ongoing, open-ended meaning making in vocabulary learning. The students' learning
processes and outcomes suggest a compelling direction for MALL L seamless language learning.

Literature Review
Constructivist Approach in Language Learning
In recent decades, we witness a paradigm shift of language learning theories from behaviorism and structurism
to a communicative approach (Salaberry, 1996). The emphasis of the communicative approach is on real-world
communication in environment and situation that language learners might actually experience (Hoopingarner,
2009). Under the emerging paradigm, learning is seen not as a passive activity that requires learners to accept
pre-packaged information, but as an active process by which learners create their own understanding. This
approach meshes well with the constructivist theory of learning (Jonassen, 1991).
          Language learning involves active mental activity such as interaction and hypothesis testing (Gass,
1997) and productive output (Swain, 1985). In addition, prior studies in the L2 classroom have brought our
attention to  the  importance of the   negotiation  of meaning,      also known    as social  meaning  making,   in   L2
development (e.g., Long, 1985). More sophisticated meaning making involves the mutual transformation in the
actions, and perhaps the thoughts and moods, of two partners (Locke & Bogin, 2006). However, the social
context has   been   undervalued as  an  arena  for collaborative     L2   learning.  Where   meaning   appears  fixed,
immutable, to be sent and received, what is lost is the collaborative nature of meaning making (Savignon, 1991).
Vocabulary (Idiom) Learning
As a main component of language learning, vocabulary learning is often delivered in conventional ways, such as
providing abstract definitions and sentences taken out of the context of normal use. Such strategies might well

lead to  simplistic conception of  vocabulary     (Miller   & Gildea,  1987),   as they may   deprive the students   of
pragmatic cues and render the process of meaning making harder (Kumaravadivelu, 1994).
         Vocabulary   can  be classified into two   categories,     context-free  and  context-dependent  vocabulary.
Context-free vocabularies,   such as nouns,   are  those    which  can    stand by themselves  without   depending   on
sentence contexts (Elliot & Zhang, 1998). Context-dependent vocabularies could either be prepositions, which
are not rich in meaning and are better learnt in sentence as their meanings depend on the presence of other
words (ibid), or compound vocabulary such as idioms whose complex nature may result in context-dependent
appropriateness of their usage (Deng, 2001) L there are many possible real-life contexts where such vocabulary
could suitably (or unsuitably but often mistakenly) be used. As contemporary learning theorists argue that
language teachers should create the right conditions for students to 'uncover' grammar (e.g., Thornbury, 2001)
through active meaning making (Bourke, 2005), we envisage a similar principle for vocabulary learning.
         Over the years, vocabulary learning theorists have advocated productive (apart from receptive) learning
(Webb,   2005), inductive  meaning   making   (Lewis,     1997),   and contextual   learning (Sanaoui,   1995), among
others. Furthermore, Nation (2001) proposes three psychological processes for successful vocabulary learning:
noticing (a word is highlighted as being salient text input), retrieving (repeat encountering of the word) and
creative/generative (a previously encountered word is met or used in a slightly different context). The three-
stage model stresses the importance of the coupling of receptive and productive learning, and the learners'
generative usage of the vocabulary in alternative contexts. All these point to the trend of emphasizing students'
self-construction of understanding in vocabulary usage, and this is done most likely through authentic learning.
Mobile Technology for Vocabulary Learning
As authentic learning (i.e., learning activities that are framed around real-life contexts) comes into the picture of
language  learning  (Widdowson,   1978),   MALL     becomes      a viable  solution to  the blending  of the language
learners' learning environment into their real-life contexts. Prior research on mobile learning has shown that the
mobility and connectivity of the devices enable students to become an active participant, not a passive receiver,
in learning activities (Looi et al., 2009). The recent development of MALL demonstrates a similar tendency.
         According to a survey by Kukulska-Hulme & Shield (2007), prior MALL studies could be divided into
two categories: content-based (formal learning-oriented; developing learning materials for mobile access) and
design-oriented (informal learning-oriented, out-of-class, often authentic and/or social learning activities). Most
of the MALL studies in     the context of vocabulary learning have conformed to content-based design, whose
systems work in the way of pushing of relatively static learning materials or quizzes to the device learning (e.g.,
Thornton & Houser, 2002; Levy & Kennedy, 2005), which could be attributed to behaviorist learning despite
having the advantage of anytime, anywhere. Ogata, Akamatsu & Yano's (2004) design moves one big step by
incorporating context-aware technology, as their system enables the learners to use their handhelds to detect the
RFID-tagged objects and retrieve their names (vocabulary) and explanations. All the above-stated designs are
however still restricted to receptive learning and are usually (not always) only suitable for learning context-free
vocabulary.  Learning    context-dependent    vocabulary      with   the   above   designs   may  result  in  learners'
understanding of the general definitions but not necessary the proper usage of them.
Seamless Learning and Language Learning
Recognizing both the importance and the limitation of formal, in-class language learning, language learning
theorists have been advocating the integration of formal and informal language learning (which could be dated
back to the pre-MALL days, e.g., Titone, 1969). MALL becomes a solution to the blending of the language
learners' learning environment into their real-life contexts. The handhelds which could function as a personal

further enhanced by blending mobile and Web 2.0 technologies to bring to the students the situated mobile
learning experiences that take into account both the students' everyday tasks and socio-constructivism (Winters,
2007). Such integration can be expected to balance and bring out the best of both individual and social learning.
         The integration of technology-assisted informal learning into the students' lives does not imply the
elimination  of school-based  formal    learning. Instead,    it becomes   more   challenging for teachers   to inspire

learning pedagogy    for the e-generation.  Such   framework       favors contextualized learning, the   integration of
formal and informal learning, and, more importantly, the integration of receptive and productive learning.

Our one-and-a-half-9"#$( 1/7893( <*6G"3( .8&6:1Q> (!"#$%&'), consists of a pilot study and a full-scale
intervention, in July-September 2009 and in January-October 2010 respectively. This paper focuses on the
design, implementation, and our analysis on the students' artifacts of the completed pilot study.
         In facilitating the pilot study, we designed a learning process to engage students in ongoing Chinese
idiom learning and writing (sentence making) activities. A class of 40 Primary 5 students participated in the
study. Each of them was assigned a HTC TyTN II smartphone with built-in digital camera, Wi-Fi access,
internet browser and Chinese text input. Furthermore, we used PBWorks (http://www.pbworks.com/) to create
the wiki space for photo/sentence sharing and peer reviews. Apart from standard wiki features such as multi-
user content editor and page history, an online forum-style comment tool is incorporated on each wiki page. In
addition, mobile-optimized animations that depict the meanings of idioms can be accessed by students anytime,
anywhere. The animations are sponsored by our research partner, a digital content developer based in Taiwan.
         Figure 1 depicts     the process  of our  learning      design.  The  four-activity process  is  iterative and
encompasses  formal   and     informal  learning spaces,      individual  and social   learning spaces,  receptive  and
productive activities, and the use of both mobile and Web 2.0 technologies (that is, learning takes place in both
the physical world and the cyberspace). The processes of the four activities are described below:

         Activity 2 L Out-of-class, contextual, independent sentence making: students carry the phones assigned

contexts in their daily lives which could be associated with any learned idiom. They then take photos, make
sentences that contain the idioms to describe the photos, and post them onto a class wiki space. In the wiki
space, we create one wiki page for each idiom covered in the class for students to post their photos/sentences.
This offers convenience for comparing various student-identified contexts pertaining to the same idiom.

the contexts in the photos or the sentences made, and to provide recommendation in correcting or improving the
sentences. The students returned the phones to the school upon the completion of the study.
       The data collected and analyzed for project evaluation consists of: (1) Pre- and post-quizzes; (2) Pre-
and post-questionnaires; (3) Pre- and post-interviews with two high-, two medium- and two low-ability students
(in terms of their academic performances in Chinese class) selected by the teacher; (4) Field notes taken during
the in-class activities; (5) Student artifacts and online interactions. Due to space constraint and since we focus
this paper on the analysis of the students' meaning making process, we will not go into the details of (1)-(4).

Findings
Constructivist Approach in Language Learning
Within the nine-week period, the 40 students contributed a total of 481 photo/sentence sets, revised (corrected
or modified) sentences for 124 times, and posted 134 comments. However, the variation in the statistics of
individual students' contributions was  huge  (mean   =  12.0,  SD   =  25.9),  as the top  contributor posted  151
photo/sentence sets (or 31.9% of the entire class's postings) while 70.0% of her peers contributed less than 1
photo/sentence set   per week in   average. On  the   other hand,   the students'  participation levels were  more
consistent in offering sentence revisions (mean = 3.1, SD = 7.3) and comments (mean = 4.5, SD = 3.4).
       Our observation and our interactions with the teacher and the students throughout the pilot study and
our post-study interviews with six students had helped us to identify the challenges that had resulted in the
widely varied levels of participation among the students, which are listed below:!
 !  Affective issue: Many students showed great engagement during the in-class Activity 1 but when it came
    to the after school informal setting, they did not treat the smartphone as a learning tool but more a new toy.
    As what we have found out from the interviews and casual chats with the students, after enthusiastic
    exploration  of  the smartphone  functionalities  available  in the initial period, many  of  the students  had
    resorted  to play  online or installed  games from     time  to time  apart  from   carrying out  the instructed
    activities. When being questioned about how they could and whether they had used their phones for other
    out-of-school learning activities, their common reply wasU(<%6(&8"#>3 except for a student who claimed that
    he had occasionally checked an online English dictionary with his phone in doing school assignments.
 !  Technical issue: Some students intermittently encountered and were frustrated by the technical problems in
    posting photos and sentences to the Web via their handhelds.
 !  Parental attitudes: Fearing of misplace or damage, most of the parents forbad the students to bring the
    phones out of their home except for bringing them to school, thus defeating the purpose of 24x7 seamless
    learning and severely narrowed the contexts that the students could associate the learned idioms with.
    Indeed, 83.2% of the contributed photos taken outside campus took place within the students' home.
       As a learning design informed by the seamless learning framework, which implies the necessity of
changing students' belief and, it is unrealistic to expect a significant breakthrough in the students within a nine-
week period. Despite all that, after analyzing the student artifacts and their peer learning process, we found that
they have shown great potential and promise, which we shall elaborate in the following sub-sections.

(Hedley, 1992) with the aim of rectifying, internalizing and enriching their understanding of the idioms.
       From their artifacts, the students demonstrated their creativity by making up contexts that associate

           Nevertheless, the students' asynchronous online discussions on the idiom usage were relatively trivial
in general. We believed that the lack of training in this aspect was the main reason, as we merely presented a
few mock-up photo/sentence artifacts and discussions generated by ourselves to the class at the beginning of the
study. As such, we (the researchers and the teacher) applied some online forum facilitation strategies (e.g.,
Wong & Looi, 2010) by tactfully commenting on student artifacts at the right time and in right ways in order to
give space for the students to engage in meaningful discussions. We also advised the teacher to promote class-

           Kovecses & Szabco (1996) define idioms as linguistic expressions whose overall meaning (known as
figurative/idiomatic meaning) cannot be predicted from the meanings of the constituent parts (known as literal
meaning). For some of the Chinese idioms, however, their applicable contexts have to take the literal meanings

conventional ways of assessing them by, for example, sentence making, may not thoroughly achieve. Indeed,
we noticed that some of the student artifacts offer seemingly error-free sentences, if they are read independently,

instruction where teachers provide general explanations and demonstrate idiom usage in limited contexts, this
personal-to-social meaning making process has effectively pushed the boundary of the learning materials as the
students' self-identified contextual uses of the idioms (many of which have caught us by surprise as we have
never thought of using the idioms in such contexts) have become a rich resource for the students to perform
(essentially inductive) constructivist learning on the idioms.

Discussion
Researchers have been investigating the facilitation of improvisation and/or creative learner output of various
forms as a potentially effective means of language learning (e.g., Hodson, 2008). The mobile technology may
support in situ improvisation and creative output such as taking appropriate pictures in contexts to illustrate the
idioms   under    study. In our  study,  while    such  language    learning  activities  could  be  carried out  without
technological support, it is the mobile affordance of in situ data collection (in particular, the camera function)
that offers them the ease of generating their artifacts and helps others to visualize their idiom-and-context

          This learning process design is grounded in several existing learning language approaches and yet with
some novelty. It is inductive vocabulary learning, yet not entirely based on teacher-supplied resources (e.g.,
Mishan, 2004), but student-generated ones, which are more authentic to the students' daily life. It is language
learning by meaning making, yet not through reading or conversational comprehension (e.g., Donato, 1994) but
students'   idiom-context   associations.   It emphasizes       contextual   learning,  productive   outputs  and  socio-
constructivism. In addition, it reinforces a principle of learning L make errors work for the students and not
against them (Rubin & Y06:216%3( BC`M,-( .%( 67$( 1/7893( #%( <&8&6:( 2#'">( /0#/( =6%/#&%1( I6/0( /0"( =6$$"=/( #%8(
ambiguous (or erroneous) idiom usages would turn out to be an excellent venue for student discussion. The
teacher should hold back his corrective comments to encourage debates among students on diversified views.
          The pilot study has also informed us that pertaining to personalized learning, the student artifacts show
some indicators of personalized seamless learning, i.e., students' proactive association of what they have learnt
in-class  with what   they  are  experiencing     in daily life, and  perhaps    with  further enactment,   reflection and
personal meaning making. Pertaining to peer learning, the rich results of the social meaning making practice had
facilitated ongoing   student    discussions   and    inductive  comparisons     of  varied student-identified   contexts.
Together with the activities of watching idiomatic animations, this seamless language learning process fulfils
Nation's (2001) three-stage process for (essentially personalized) vocabulary learning, and even extends it to
involve social learning, and turns the language subject into an authentic learning experience.
          On   the other   hand, the    challenges   faced  in   our pilot   study   have helped   us  in identifying  the
implementation. Our original intention of leveraging on general digital natives' eagerness to share their real-life
experiences  'on-the-fly',  mediated    by  Web   2.0  (Prensky,   2004)    and  mobile   devices, did  not take off.  The
students were keener on game-playing than blogging. The findings will trigger us to apply additional strategies
to prepare the students who will involve in the full-scale study in the following year.

Conclusion
In this paper, we report a pilot study within the MALL paradigm that is both creative learner output-centric and
seamless learning-inclined. These two areas, which promised great educational potential, have been seriously
untapped in prior MALL studies. In our study, from artifact generation to peer learning activities, we observed a
trajectory of noticing-retrieving-generating process, and personal-to-social meaning making among the students,
which we wish to analyze further in order to unveil its relation with Chomsky's (1986) distinctions between
Internal- and External-language learning, and the general thinking skills involved (such as that with respect to
Bloom's Taxonomy). While the results of the study are promising, much work need to be done to ensure the
students' learning motivation and enthusiasm at the in-class mobile assisted learning could be extended to their
off-campus   time   when   they  are assigned   handhelds     24x7.  Still, with proper   design   and implementation   of
seamless language learning, we envisage the potential of MALL to revolutionize language learning by using
mobile devices as individual stu8"%/1V(2"$16%#5(<5"#$%&%'(07I1>, and further synergize the formal (in-class) and
informal (real-life), as well as the personal and social language learning spaces.
