    The Effect of Curricular Elements on Student Interest in Science
          Abstract:    Enhancing   student  interest  in science   is  a critical  goal for   science education.
          However,    little is known   about what   makes    science  interesting to the students.   This study
          examined the effect of three curricular elements (topic, activity, and learning goal) on student
          interest in science.   The results suggest significant effect of activity types, among which the
          "hands-on" and technology-based ones tend to elicit higher interest.

Introduction
Scholars have pointed out in recent years that students are becoming uninterested or losing interest in school
learning, particularly in areas of math and science.       This is alarming because research has shown that interest
leads to effective learning processes, and has strong positive impact on various learning outcomes (Renninger,
Hidi, & Krapp, 1992).     Thus, a critical goal of education should be to enhance students' interest in science.
          What    might   explain  our  schools'    ineffectiveness   in maintaining    student interest  is the  lack  of
knowledge regarding what makes science interesting (or not).          Much of prior research has focused on examining
the features   of perceptual    stimuli (Berlyne,   1960)  and   texts (Hidi  &    Baird, 1986)  that influence  people's
interestingness judgments. Studies that are more relevant to science interest have only begun to identify the
science topics or instructional activities (Jenkin & Nelson, 2005; Palmer, 2009) of high or low interest to young
students. We believe these approaches are insufficient given the complexity of real classrooms.             What we need
is to examine variables that possibly influence student interest together, instead of in isolation, as students'
interest is most likely the outcome of their simultaneous interactions with all of these variables.
          We report here some of the quantitative findings from a study of the independent and interactive effects
of curricular elements on student interest in science in the school context.           Specifically, three elements were
examined -- content topic, activity, and learning goal.       They are chosen because they are present in most (if not
all) learning scenarios, and they can be easily manipulated by educators.

Methods
Five hundred thirty three middle school students from a suburban district near a major Midwest city participated
in this study. We chose to focus on middle school grades because they have been suggested to be the age when
academic interest begins to decline.      Thus it is critical to understand what makes science interesting to these
students, and  consequently     how to keep them  interested.    The demographic   make-up (gender,    minority status) of
the participants is quite diverse, which is representative of student population in the particular school district.
          The data and results reported here are based on a questionnaire completed by all participants.             The
questionnaire presented students with 100 instructional episodes (IEs) -- instructional periods devoted specific
content or skill.  Each IE is designed such that it represents a unique combination of curricular elements -- a
topic, an activity type, and a learning goal category.     Four topics chosen from the biology domain, five activity
types, and seven   learning goal categories were embedded in the IEs.        For example, the IE "Look at real data on
polar bears    to see  if  global  warming    is hurting   the   ecosystem   at   the north   pole" represents  the topic
"ecosystems",     the activity   type "design/conduct    investigation   without   scientific instruments   or  interactive
technology", and the learning goal "societal impact".         One fourth of the IEs (n=25) are under the same topic,
and IEs   under   every topic   share the same   activity-goal   structure (i.e.,  item 3 under  the  topic  "ecosystems"
represents the same activity    type and learning goal category as item 3 under the topic "cells").      The IEs, though
hypothetical, were designed to resemble the actual IEs that take place in participants' science classes.         Students
were asked to rate how interesting they thought each IE was using a 1-6 scale (6 being the most interesting).

Results
Factor analysis was conducted to explore the structure of the questionnaire data.           Hierarchical linear modeling
(HLM) models were run to further examine the effect of the curricular elements (and their categories).           HLM is
appropriate in this case because the ratings of the questionnaire items are nested within individual students.          In
other words, the variance between the item ratings was due to not only item differences but also individual
differences.

Factor Analysis
The  questionnaire    data   were transformed    two ways     to understand  the   embedded   structure.  First, for each
student, the ratings of items of the same activity-goal combination (i.e., across topics) were averaged to generate
an  "item-average"    score.    A  comparison    of the  "item-average"    scores  shows    a great  degree  of variation,
suggesting that the variance between the item ratings could be attributed to the activity types and/or learning
goal categories.   Second, the ratings of items under the same topic (i.e., across activity-goal combinations) were
averaged to generate a "topic-average" score.        The comparison of these scores, however, did not show much

variation, with the only notable difference being that the average rating of items under the topic "human body
systems" was slightly higher than that of other topics ("cells", "Ecosystems", and "Diversity of living things").
          As much of the variance existed for the "item-average" scores, a principal axis factor analysis was
done on these scores.   Three factors were extracted (scree plot and factor loadings are not shown here due to
limited space), and the activity types and learning goal categories of the items loaded on each factor are listed in
Table 1.   The results suggest that the variance explained by the activity-goal combinations is attributable to
activity only, not learning goal. Furthermore, it seems that students did not perceive the differences between the
original five activity types; rather, they grouped them into three new categories -- purely cognitive, technology-
based, and hands-on.   Students' interest varied primarily depending on the    activity type represented in each IE.

Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM)
HLM models including the "human body system" (Human) topic and the "Tech" and "HandsOn" activity types
as level 1 predictors were run.   The significant coefficients for these variables (Table 2) confirm that students on
average perceived IEs dealing with human to be slightly more interesting, and suggest that the average interest
in IEs involving hands-on and technology-based activities is higher than purely cognitive activities.    Compared
to the variance component to the model without any predictors, these variables explained approximately 14% of
the level 1 variance (the majority of which was due to the activity type predictors), which is significant.

Discussion
The results  confirmed   that the curricular elements    examined   in  the study indeed contribute substantially to
students' interest in science IEs. It is interesting that among the three elements, only activity exerted significant
effect, whereas topic and learning goal had little or no effect.     With much of the current emphasis on content
choices and the embedment of learning goals or driving questions in curriculum, this finding raises the need to
focus more on what activities to include in a curriculum, and how students perceive such activities.
          The finding that students tend to be more interested in IEs that are hands-on or involve technology is
not surprising, but it contrasts with our observation of participants' actual science classes (details presented
elsewhere) where few IEs fell into these categories.     Therefore, one way to enhance student interest (and hence
performance) in science is to restructure the classes to incorporate more opportunities of such nature.
