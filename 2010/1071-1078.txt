         Abstract:     This study examined the design and process of how students' reflective assessment
         promoted    collaborative   metacognition   for   conceptual   and  epistemic    changes,  mediated   by
         Knowledge     Forum,     a computer-supported     environment.     The  design   involved   augmenting
         knowledge-building inquiry with reflective assessment ­ Students wrote reflective summaries to
         track their initial understanding and trajectories of growth toward scientific understanding in the
         domain of electrochemistry.       Two classes of 10th grade students in Hong Kong participated in
         Reflective Assessment (RA) and Reflective Assessment with Scaffolds (RAS) conditions.            Results
         indicated  that both  classes improved   on  conceptual-change    and  epistemic-beliefs   measures; the
         effects were  stronger   for the  class with scaffolds.  Qualitative  analyses   showed   how   students'
         reflective  assessment   and  collaboration helped   them  to  develop  metaconceptual    and   epistemic
         awareness as they examined their own and others' understanding.           A path analysis indicated that
         students' engagement on Knowledge Forum predicted reflective collaboration that in turn exerted
         effects on their changes in conceptual understanding and epistemic beliefs.

Theoretical Perspectives
Across  science  education    and  learning sciences,   there are now   major   shifts towards   theories of  learning   that
emphasize both individual and social aspects of science learning (Duit & Treagust, 2003; Vosniadou, 2008).               It is
now widely accepted that science learning can be facilitated when students articulate their prior ideas and explain
their understanding to each other. Conceptual change is examined emphasizing the social construction of knowledge
and discursive   interactions  in classroom  (Scott, Asoko    &  Leach,  2007).  Furthermore,    researchers now   question
conceptual change as a sudden change or a replacement of misconceptions with scientific ones through externally-
driven conceptual conflict (Chan, Burtis & Bereiter, 1997). Instead, conceptual change involves a gradual process
where science concepts are gradually restructured mediated by students' intentional-learning strategies (Sinatra &
Pintrich, 2003). From a learning sciences perspective, there is a need to capture processes of conceptual change
supported by collaborative discourse and to design learning environments to foster intentional conceptual change.

Intentional Conceptual Change
Current  research   on intentional   conceptual  change    emphasizes   the role   of  learners' metacognitive   strategies,
epistemic beliefs and agency in knowledge restructuring (Sinatra & Pintrich, 2003). It also points to the need to
designing learning   environments     that encourage    learners to employ   goal-directed,   reflective  strategies and  to
develop metaconceptual awareness. Cognitive research has shown that students' epistemic beliefs can constrain or
facilitate student thinking, reasoning, and science learning (Stathopoulou, & Vosniadou, 2007).           Researchers have
argued that conceptual change involves not only changes in concepts; there needs to be changes in students' views
about the nature  of   science (Duit  & Treagust,   2003).  Vosniadou    (2008)  noted   that conceptual  change   involves
metaconceptual awareness ­ Students will be able to learn science concepts and principles only if they are aware of
their prior understanding and the shift of their initial views toward science knowledge. Increasingly the emphasis is
to examine conceptual change that includes not only individual cognitive development but also social and collective
aspects; socio-cognitive discourse plays a key role in facilitating conceptual change. Although there has been much
progress  indicating the  role of  metacognition  and   epistemic beliefs on   students'  conceptual change,  most    of the
research  are correlation studies.  Fewer   studies  have  examined    designing for   intentional conceptual change     that
brings about metaconceptual awareness with epistemic changes supported by social and collective discourse.

Computer-Supported Collaborative Knowledge Building
How   can current   views of   intentional conceptual   change   be integrated  in instruction   emphasizing  collaborative
discourse? Researchers have suggested how computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) can make important
contribution  to conceptual-change    research (Miyake,    2007). Relating  to the  roles of  interaction and discourse   in
science  classroom,  technological    affordances   can further   provide a  medium    whereby     students  can articulate,
communicate, represent and reconstruct their ideas for sustained inquiry. This study adopts an educational approach,

knowledge    building, a   forerunner   of   CSCL,    that emphasizes      knowledge    creation as  a  collective  work  of  the
community; and that knowledge is improvable by means of a discourse (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006).                  To support
student discourse, knowledge Forum (KF), a multi-media database constructed by students, was designed to support
collaborative knowledge building discourse.           In a knowledge-building community (both face-to-face and online),
students  engage   in  scientific discourse      that involves    posing   cutting-edge    problems,   generating  theories  and
conjectures, searching    for scientific  information,   elaborating    on   others' ideas, co-constructing   explanations,  and
revising their theories.  Students' pre-instructional ideas and learning pathways can be represented on the computer
forum and thus become objects of inquiry for conceptual change. There is now substantial evidence on the roles of
knowledge building on students' collective inquiry and scientific understanding (e.g., Zhang et al., 2007).

Knowledge Building, Reflective Assessment and Conceptual Change
       A   question   may  then   arise   as  to why   another    study   is  needed  on   knowledge    building  and  scientific
understanding. Despite major progress in two decades of research, there have been no systematic studies using this
knowledge-building     approach   to   examine    conceptual     change.   Various   principles  advocated    by  researchers in
conceptual   change   such    as intentional   goal-directed      strategies, metaconceptual     awareness,   epistemic  beliefs
(Vosniadou,   2008)   are well   aligned  with   knowledge-building.       However,   how   collaborative  knowledge-building
dynamics can bring about metaconceptual awareness and epistemic changes has not been examined. Further, we
argue that knowledge building can enrich conceptual change studies that often emphasize small-group collaboration.
There is a need to understand how conceptual change can take place in communities of learners and knowledge-
builders. Knowledge building is not just a pedagogical approach but a theory of epistemology; so how students
working   with knowledge      might   change  their   epistemic   views   are  fruitful lines of inquiry.  Finally, knowledge-
building  research on  science    learning   has mostly    been   conducted   with   elementary-school   children.  It would  be
useful to extend the scope of inquiry to investigating knowledge building for high-school science.
       This study employed a design developed in research on assessment of knowledge building with students
assessing their own collaboration (Lee, Chan, & van Aalst, 2006; van Aalst & Chan, 2007). Research has shown that
students assessing their own scientific inquiry promoted metacognition (White & Fredericksen, 1998).                   Similarly,
student-directed e-portfolio   assessment    with  students   documenting     how    they  collaborated in knowledge-building
discourse fostered their domain understanding (van Aalst & Chan, 2007). This study extends this line of inquiry: We
designed knowledge building for conceptual change focusing on promoting metacognition in a collaborative context.
Extending  our earlier   study   (xx), we  asked  students    to  reflect on  their  prior conceptions  and   to track how   they
moved towards scientific understanding as they considered others' contributions and revised their ideas.
       To iterate, this study aimed to design and examine how reflective assessment with collaborative dynamics
would promote    metaconceptual     and   epistemic   awareness     for conceptual   change.   Three research questions were
included: (1)  What   was  the   role  of the knowledge-building        environment     on students' conceptual   and  epistemic
changes? (2) How did students' reflection contribute to their changes in conceptual and epistemic understanding?
and (3) what were the relations among knowledge-building dynamics, conceptual change and epistemic growth?

Methods
Participants
Eighty 10th graders (Age ranging 15-16) in two chemistry classes in Hong Kong participated in this study. The
lessons were conducted in English and students wrote notes in English on Knowledge Forum (KF).                      Both classes
engaged in knowledge-building inquiry with reflective assessment. The first class is called Reflective Assessment
(RA, n = 40) and the second Reflective Assessment with Scaffolds (RAS, n = 40). Both classes were taught by the
same teacher, who had taught high-school chemistry for more than twelve years and had used knowledge-building
pedagogy for over 6 years.
Procedure
This study was conducted in the second semester of 2008-09 lasting from Feb-June (16-18 weeks). There were five
chemistry  lessons    each week;      each   lesson   was   of   35  minute    duration.   In both   classes, students   learned
electrochemistry   using  knowledge-building      inquiry   approaches     and  they    wrote computer   notes   on Knowledge
Forum. Due to school policy for comparable curriculum, students had similar inquiry experiences (see later section,
1-4) and  both  used   the same   instructional   topics,   textbooks     and reference    materials and conducting    the same
experiments. However, there were also some key differences: Primarily students in the "Reflective Assessment with
Scaffolds" class (RAS) wrote reflective summaries on KF using a set of pre-designed conceptual-change "scaffolds"
(e.g., My initial ideas, What we think, What I think now). Alternatively, students in the "Reflective Assessment"
class (RA)   wrote reflective summaries without the scaffolds (RA). "Scaffolds" are prompts or sentence openers on

KF; different scaffolds can be designed depending on subjects and contexts. The use of conceptual-change scaffolds
were to examine further whether the use of scaffolds would enhance further students' collaborative reflection.

Designing a Knowledge-Building Environment for Conceptual Change
We designed the learning environment based on knowledge building pedagogy aligning that with conceptual change
principles (Vosniadou & Kollias, 2003). The principles and activities of the design are briefly described:

(1) Activate prior knowledge through classroom discourse. Students need to activate and reflect on prior knowledge
and to articulate their ideas for science learning. Students worked in groups discussing science topics/problems in
classroom. Students were scaffolded to present their ideas, make observations of experiments; raise questions they
did not understand, elaborate and comment on others' views. Students' ideas were shared and made public using
concept-maps, posters and knowledge-building walls (boards for posting ideas).          When students became familiar
with articulating their thinking, they then continued their inquiry and contributed their ideas and questions onto KF.
(2) Foster metacognition through KF scaffolds and problem-centered inquiry.          Students were encouraged to raise
authentic problems from prior ideas and daily life on electrochemistry that puzzled them. Extending the classroom
inquiry, students wrote their ideas on the discussion views on KF (Figure 1 left):    Students engaged in goal-directed
inquiry- they  posed   problems, made     conjectures/hypotheses,     co-constructed explanations,    compared different
explanations  and revised their understanding.   KF scaffolds    including `I need   to understand',  `my theory',  `new
information', and   `a better theory'   prompted  metacognitive   thinking   and  theory  revision. Teacher facilitation
involved  helping   students  integrate KF  and  classroom     discourse  and  to notice   conflicts, discrepancies and
identifying gaps for further inquiry.
(3) Develop deep understanding through model-based explanatory inquiry.         Students were involved in constructing
models of chemical cells using everyday materials and explaining to each other how their chemical cells work.
(4)  Integrate fragmented ideas and use `rise-above' explanation. To tackle the problem of fragmented ideas, a
common barrier to conceptual change, students deepened their understanding using KF functions of `rise above' and
`references' to synthesize diverse and fragmented ideas from classmates as they worked towards more coherent
explanations. Teachers integrated online discussion with classroom talk to help students deepen their inquiry.

 Figure 1.  A Discussion View on Knowledge Forum (left) and an Example of a Reflective Summary Note (right).

(5) Develop   metaconceptual  awareness    through reflective   assessment.   In both classes, students were asked to
review the notes on KF, to reflect on their initial beliefs, and to track their changing ideas incorporating classmates'
ideas (Figure 1, right): The teacher prompt written on KF included: You are encouraged to review the computer
notes written by you and your classmates in the database.      Write a summary note to reflect and to consolidate what
you have learnt from the views of `Batteries' & `Simple chemical cell'...In writing the summary, you may select
relevant computer notes (references) as evidence that support your understanding. Think about how your chemical
knowledge has developed or changed. As noted above, in the Reflective Assessment with Scaffolds (RAS) class,
students were further provided with conceptual-change scaffolds (e.g., "My initial idea"). Students could also use
other KF scaffolds such as "a better theory" and "this theory cannot explain" and "putting our knowledge together".
       To help students with their reflection, in both classroom and online discourse, the teacher would scaffold
students to reflect more  deeply in   discussing their notes.  As  well, the  teacher also wrote on    KF making    some
observation:  "So far  I have  observed   some   benefits  of  chemistry  gains  from   your summaries:    (i) You   are

encouraged to give more evidence (chemical knowledge) to reflect on your understanding or knowledge gains (not
just say KF is good). (ii). It may be useful to tell us more of your initial thoughts and final thoughts on a particular
chemistry concept.   (iii) Continue to build on others' notes to deepen your ideas after reviewing these previous notes.
Of course you can continue to raise other (emerging) questions or observations in everyday life."

Analyses and Results
We first assessed student changes in conceptual and epistemic changes after the instruction; we then examined why
and how    such  changes   might take place  relating to knowledge-building     inquiry  and  reflection, and  finally we
investigated the relations among knowledge building activities, conceptual-change learning and epistemic changes.

Conceptual-Change Learning in Electrochemistry
Conceptual-Change    Written    Tests and  Explanation     Written    questions were    designed  to tap   into students'
understanding   of electrochemistry   probing  into   students'  alternative conceptions.  The   written  questions were
designed   based  on studies  on   conceptual-change  in   electrochemistry  in science  education   research.  Questions
included open-ended ones asking students to explain their understanding of key concepts to probe their conceptions
(what is oxidation?). Responses to forced-choice questions were coded on students' explanations of their choice.
The pretest   and posttest percentage  scores were    13.8 (7.1) and  57.3   (12.3), and 14.1 (6.4)  and  49.1  (15.4) for
Reflective Assessment with Scaffolds (RAS) and Reflective Assessment (RA) classes, respectively. Analyses of pre-
posttests using paired t-tests showed  that both classes improved on the conceptual-change tests with RAS, t (39), =
20.14, p<.001,   and RA,   t (39), =  14.21, p<.001.  Analyses   using   ANCOVA      controlling for pre-test  differences
indicated that higher scores were obtained for students in Reflective Assessment with Scaffolds (RAS).
Changes in Alternative Conceptions in Written Tests        The number of alternative conceptions (misconceptions) for
each student was identified from their responses to the written tests. The means of alternative conceptions were 6.4
(1.7) and 5.7(1.2) at pretests and 1.9 (1.5) and 3.0  (1.9) at posttests for RAS and RA classes respectively. Students
in both classes decreased in the number of alternative conceptions after instruction. ANCOVA on posttest results
using pretest scores as covariates indicated that there were more decreases in the number of alternative conceptions
for students in the class of Reflective Assessment with scaffolds (RAS), F (1, 78) = 10.08, p<.003.

Changes in Epistemic Beliefs
Students were administered a questionnaire on epistemic beliefs (adapted from Conley et al., 2004) to examine the
ways students think about the nature of knowledge. The questionnaire was pilot tested with over 300 students and
validated in our earlier study (xx). Consistent with the earlier study, three factors were identified (1) "Certainty-
Source", (2) "Development" and (3) "Justification" with scale reliabilities ranging from 0.64 to 0.83.    An example of
an item on Certainty is "Most questions in science have one right answer"; an example of an item on Development
is "Scientific knowledge will not change over time", and an example of an item on Justification is "Ideas in science
can come from your own question". Interviews were also conducted to provide more information on what students
thought about these items; qualitative analyses are currently undertaken.     Paired t-tests showed that students in both
classes made changes towards more sophisticated epistemic beliefs based on the combined scores, for RAS, t (38) =
4.73, p<.001 and for RA, t (38) =2.27, p<.03.  Separate analyses showed that students in RAS improved more on the
subscales of  "certainty-source" and "development" and students in RA improved more on "justification".

Students' Knowledge Forum Engagement and Collaborative Reflection
Knowledge Forum Engagement (ATK) We examined students' overall participation and engagement in Knowledge
Forum (KF) using a software called the Analytic Toolkit (ATK, Burtis, 1998) that uses log files to show students'
participation and  activity  on  KF.   We    included several   ATK   indices  commonly    used  in  knowledge-building
research : (1) number of KF note written, (2) % of notes read, (3) % of linked notes, (4) scaffolds (thinking prompts)
(5) keywords and (6) revision. Some of these indices show student collaboration (e.g., notes read/linked) and others
reflect metacognition such as the use of scaffolds" and "revision" of notes for purposeful activities.
       We now report results of ATK indices for RAS and RA classes:            number of notes written, 21.5 and 22.60
notes; percentage of notes read, 55% & 47%; note-linked, 80% and 68%; and scaffolds, 21 and 9.0, respectively.
Although there were no norms for ATK, comparison with other studies indicated that these students were engaged
actively participating and   collaborating on KF.   Compared     to the  literature on online learning   with fragmented
contribution (Hewitt, 2003), these number indicate high level of contribution; they are also comparable to those
identified in mature knowledge building communities (Zhang et al., 2007). Comparison of ATK indices also showed
some advantages for the RAS class over the RA class.

Reflective Assessment and Collaborative Reflection     As described above, students wrote three reflective summaries
to reflect on their initial and new ideas in electrochemistry based on their discourse.   These reflective summaries
were scored on a 6-point scale.   At the lower levels (1-2), the reflection depicts that students were just describing
new information with limited reflection on what it meant for their conceptions.      At the mid-levels (3-4),    students
demonstrated some personal thinking for identifying misconceptions or knowledge gaps in their understanding. At
the highest levels (5-6),   student reflected on their prior knowledge, identified gaps, considered how others' ideas
supported their reflection; they demonstrated metaconceptual awareness of initial and new ideas and noted how they
changed in  their understanding  of some    concepts The    summaries   were  coded and currently inter-rater  reliability
checks were being conducted.     In the following, two contrastive examples of reflective summaries are provided to
suggest how collaborative reflection may foster metaconceptual awareness for conceptual and epistemic growth..

Table  2 shows     another  example   with two related   episodes   ­   In the first one, Student B   identified  her prior
understanding     (state of matter &  electrolysis); it is a   key concept   and  a  common   alternative conception.   She
reflected on why she had the problem (prior knowledge & textbook); considered various classmates' explanations
and organized them; and she noted her new understanding but continued to identify areas she did not understand
(mercury electrode). In the second episode (factors influencing electrolysis), Student B continued to identify her
prior ideas and gaps of understanding; noted others' ideas and she puzzled over her classmate's curious information.
She tracked different ideas but focused on the original problem and reflected on her new understanding. Student B
employed good use of the scaffolds and demonstrated metacognition noting what she knew and what she did not
understand. As well, she showed metaconceptual awareness as she became more aware of her initial conceptions
and how they differed from scientific ideas. There are various instances that showed how such reflection prompted
Student B to examine nature and source of knowledge.         For example, she noted textbook as unauthentic science and
"imperfect" source of knowledge. Furthermore, she concluded using a scaffold           My belief on learning &knowledge
  implying some thinking about the importance of coherence (structure of knowledge) and role of evidence.

Contribution of Knowledge Building Activity to Conceptual & Epistemic Changes
Correlation Among Measures Table 3 shows the correlation among various measures; we pooled the two classes
because the key principles of reflective assessment      are same.   To improve the coherence for analyses, the various
ATK KF indices were combined using factor analysis (see Lee et al., 2006). Two factors were extracted, Factor 1 is
called metacognition      (scaffold use, note revision and keyword) that explains 32.6% of the variance, and factor 2 is
called collaboration (notes created, notes linked and read) that explains 30.1% of the variance. Table 3 indicates
that KB reflection was significantly correlated with ATK metacognition, conceptual change and epistemic change
scores. Furthermore, ATK collaboration scores were significantly correlated with conceptual-change scores.

Regression and Path Analyses We conducted hierarchical regression analyses on students' post-conceptual scores
first using  exam   results and  pre-conceptual    scores  (prior  achievement)     as   predictors (R2 =.34)     When  KF
engagement (ATK Collaboration) was added, additional 4.6% variance was explained (R2 =.38). Further, when we
added   reflection scores (summaries), there were additional 7.4%variances explained (R2 =.46); R2 changes were all
significant.  These results  indicated  that over   and   above    science   achievement   and  prior   knowledge,  student
engagement in forum and metacognitive reflection further contributed to post-test conceptual scores (Table 4)..

Conclusions, Implications and Significance
        This study developed a knowledge-building environment augmented with reflective assessment to examine
and to foster conceptual change and epistemic growth.         The environment was designed in ways that aligned with
conceptual-change principles focusing on students' goal-directed strategies and agency elaborated with collaborative
reflection. Results indicated that after the instruction, students in both classes changed towards more sophisticated
scientific  understanding   measured    by conceptual-change       tests in  electrochemistry.  There   is some    evidence
suggesting students also made some shifts in their epistemic beliefs. Comparing the two classes when students both
had reflection, the effects were stronger for students supported with conceptual-change scaffolds for reflection.
        A key question to address is to examine knowledge-building dynamics and to explain the pre-posttest gains,
that is, how it may be possible for students to experience these changes. We demonstrated that asking students to
engage   in  knowledge-building   inquiry  augmented    with    assessing   their  own   scientific understanding  in  their
discourse   could help   them   activate   prior knowledge,     develop    meta-conceptual    awareness,   and    reconstruct
fragmented    views into  more   coherent    explanations.  As   the   excerpt    shows, the student   identified her  prior
conceptions; examined the nature of difficulties; considered others' views; puzzled over gaps of understanding; and
integrated fragmented ideas into a more coherent account. The excerpt also suggests metacognitive reflection           was
facilitated because of the rich collaborative context with diverse ideas from classmates.       Although ATK KF indices
are quantitative, the extent to which students engaged in KF was a prerequisite for conceptual work ­ It supports the
notion of how CSCL may provide the medium through which students can articulate, represent, interact and inquire
into their ideas for sustained inquiry. Regression analyses provided support of this account indicating that students'
engagement on KF and collective reflection predicted post-test conceptual scores over and above their academic
achievement.   A  path  analysis  further  showed    that  students'     activity on Knowledge      Forum  predicted   their
collaborative reflection that in turn influenced students' posttest conceptual and epistemic changes.

        Regarding epistemic shifts from questionnaire data, the excerpts provided some glimpses suggesting how
changes were possible in collaborative inquiry and reflection.       For example, Student B reflected upon the textbook
as a source of `imperfect" knowledge decontexualized from real-world science (i.e., textbook pictures always show
smooth surface). She also pondered upon the importance of the connection among topics (structure of knowledge)
and the  need   for  justification using  evidence.  When   students  tackled   authentic  problems  and  reflected on   their
changes in understanding, they might be better able to see that knowledge is not certain and that it can be advanced.
        To conclude, this study integrated two lines of research on intentional conceptual change and knowledge
building  examining    how    conceptual   and   epistemic  changes   could  be   fostered  through collective   inquiry and
reflection. The  study  furthers   research on   knowledge  building     aligning with conceptual   change augmented     with
student-directed assessment. Whereas many studies have demonstrated the role of metaconceptual awareness and
epistemic   beliefs, this is one   of the few  studies that   illustrated how it  might  be  possible to  foster conceptual,
metaconceptual and epistemic changes through collective reflection. Furthermore, the conceptual-change reflective
assessment   summaries       provided   a   rich  data  source    to  examine     students'  alternative  understanding   of
electrochemistry, as well as to track how students could move between individual and collective growth towards
conceptual change. Instead of eradicating misconceptions, students' prior understandings could become objects of
collective inquiry. Metacognition for conceptual change is not an individual accomplishment but one that can be
examined and fostered in a community of knowledge builders. Turning over agency to students and asking them to
reflect and  to assess  their own     and collective understanding    may   help  them  develop conceptual   and  epistemic
changes and provide insights into further research on collaborative conceptual change.
