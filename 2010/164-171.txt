          A bstract: The act of drawing as a means of publicly presenting one's ideas is not cognitively
        neutral. Drawing, perhaps in a way that is somewhat like self-explanation, influences knowing
        and  learning.  It can  help learners evaluate    and transform  their understanding,  help  them
        communicate their ideas, and be a motivating and highly engaging way to process and express
        scientific concepts. Asking learners to draw when they are exploring dynamic systems can be
        highly beneficial. !"#$ %&%'()")$ *+$ ,-%./&0)$ 1%($ ,"2"&,$ *&$ '"%-&"-)3$ %44*12%&(/&0$ )2""45$
        and gestures. Learners also benefit from pedagogical and technological support in making
        drawings that support modeling. This symposium draws together research on how people use
        drawings when learning about dynamic systems. It explores different theoretical frameworks
        for analyzing drawings, their impact, interactions with prior knowledge, and the different roles
        drawing can play in learning and asks how learning by drawing can be enhanced.

Introduction
Asking learners to draw when they are exploring complex ideas is not cognitive neutral. In fact, previous work
(e.g. Gobert & Clement, 1999; Kress, Jewitt, Ogborn, & Tsatsarelis, 2001; Prangsma, Van Boxtel, & Kanselaar,
2008; Van Meter & Garner, 2005) as well as some of the papers presented in this symposium suggest the act of
drawing can be highly beneficial. Yet, compared to our knowledge of how people learn by interpreting text
(reading) and pictures  (viewing),   or by constructing   text (writing)  or speech   (verbal reporting)  we   know
relatively little about how drawing affects learning. Consequently, the focus of this symposium aims to redress
this balance a little by increasing our understanding of how knowledge and learning about dynamic systems is
influenced by drawing.
        Dynamics systems such as the workings of the circulatory system, the process of chemical reactions or
the thermodynamics of the earth are an ideal arena in which to explore how drawing shapes learning. Such
topics are complex for students to understand and there is much evidence to suggest that learners need support
to develop deep knowledge      of these systems. Researchers    have  therefore  explored how   different forms  of
representation can help learners develop this knowledge. Rather than a simple textual presentation, learners have
been provided with pictures, animations, interactive simulations and even augmented reality environments to
help them understand dynamic systems (e.g. de Jong & Ban Joolingen, 1999; Hegarty, Kriz & Cate, 2003;
Ohlson, Moher & Johnson, 2002). In contrast, in this symposium we have focused not on the representations
that are provided for the learner but on the graphical representations that learners construct for themselves.
        The   paper by  Zhang   and  Linn  addresses   how   learners can be   helped to understand  the  processes
involved in chemical reactions by interacting with a dynamic visualization of atomic interactions in hydrogen
combustion. Subsequently, learners either drew four intermediates phases of hydrogen combustion or selected
four appropriate pictures. Whilst both techniques supported learning, the relative effectiveness of the strategies
.%)$ ,"2"&,"&#$ *&$ )#6,"&#3)$ 2-/*-$ 6&,"-)#%&,/&07$ Zhang   and  Linn  suggest that drawing   helped learners   to
distinguish their ideas about chemical reactions, helping those with low knowledge realize this lack and prompt
them to   overcome  it whereas  selecting  existing pictures  prompts   students with  some   higher knowledge   of
develop and extend their ideas.
        Ainsworth explores how learners can be helped to draw more effectively. She reports on a series of
small experiments whereby students learn about the structure and the functions of the cardio-vascular system by
drawing after reading texts. Two different approaches have been trialed: a) encouraging constructive processing
of the text by self-explanation prior to drawing; and b) altering the audience and function of the intended
drawing   by asking learners to draw for themselves, a peer or draw a self-explanation.. Analysis of these studies
is on-going but so far shows that these approaches alter the drawings that students make and this may further
impact on learning.
        Nathan & Johnson also ask learners to draw the human circulatory system. However, the focus of their
work is on exploring the limits of drawing as a mode of expression, especially when learners need to convey a
dynamic, three dimensional process in a static two dimensional form. They show that our understanding of

speech that accompany a drawing are a crucial part of this system.

         The last paper in the symposium is by Van Joolingen and colleagues. They focus on learning dynamic
systems through modelling. Drawing is shown to be valuable in two ways. Firstly, it can help learners prepare
for the modelling task by requiring them to be explicit about the variables in their model activating prior
knowledge   and    acting as a constraint  on the  solution.   Secondly,  a  drawing,   if constructed   using specific
formalisms, can act as the model without further transformation.
         The papers in this symposium were selected to address a number of major issues in the area of drawing
to learn. The first issue explored is the varied roles drawing plays in learning. Across the papers, we see drawing
used as  preparation  for  learning  new  ideas,  during  reading   about new   concepts,  as  a  way  of reflecting on
presented material, and for communication and assessment. Secondly, the researchers highlight the cognitive
processes that drawing supports. Properties of drawing as a medium itself as well as the socially compelling
drive to be understood by other interlocutors shape the process and outcomes of drawing. Taken together, the
papers suggest that drawing helps learners make their ideas explicit, perhaps in a way that is analogous to self-
explanation, so that they are able to overcome gaps in the material or generate new inferences. A third important

understanding across modes of representation, whether that transformation predicts learning, and how drawings
can be understood as part of a multi-modal construction.
         There are, however, important differences between the approaches described in the papers. Drawing

work  that should   contribute to  a lively  interaction among    presenters  and  members     of  the audience. These
common threads and divergent points of view will inform the discussion offered by Peggy van Meter.
         Interest in research on the nature of drawing and evidence of learning by drawing is growing in the
Learning Sciences. This symposium offers a timely opportunity to reflect upon a research agenda for learning by
drawing. By contrasting these four diverse perspectives we can explore which theoretical approaches/models
should inform our understanding of learning by drawing, such as characteristics of learners, tasks and the social
and  technological  environments    within   which drawings     are constructed  and  explained.   We    can  also  gain
purchase about broad concerns about how to analyze drawings, as well as questions such as how drawing shapes
and is in turn shaped by cognitive structures that mediate drawing to learn and communicate. As a consequence
we  will be in   a better position  to understand  how    we   should support   learners   as they draw   to learn, and
researches interested in analyzing data from drawing tasks.

How can selection and drawing support learning from dynamic visualizations?

When students generate drawings it helps them learn from expository text (Van Meter & Garner, 2005) and
from  scientific   visualizations (Zhang   &  Linn, 2008).     Generating   a   drawing  requires  students   to select
information, to distinguish this information from their existing views, and to represent connections among the
selected elements. Dynamic visualizations support chemistry learning because they illustrate interactions at the
molecular level (Ardac & Akaygun, 2004; Kozma, 2003; Williamson & Abraham, 1995). Yet students often
find them difficult to follow and neglect nuanced information such as bond breaking and formation. Learners
need guidance to help integrate ideas about molecular interactions and link with observable and symbolic ideas.
Our previous study demonstrated that students who generated drawings when using dynamic visualizations can
integrate more ideas than those who learned only with visualizations. To further clarify the mechanism of
drawing,   this study compares     selection among   drawings     and   generating  drawings   to  help students   learn
chemistry with dynamic visualizations.
         Students   studied  chemical   reactions  using   the WISE     (Web-Based   Inquiry   Science    Environment)
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Cars project designed following the Knowledge Integration framework (Linn & Hsi, 2000).
Students interact with a dynamic visualization showing atomic interactions during hydrogen combustion (see
F igure 1) for a screenshot of the visualizations) and integrate symbolic, molecular, and observable ideas to
understand  hydrogen   fuel  cell cars. Drawing   and   selection  occur  after the visualization  step.  The  drawing
activity requires students to generate four pictures to represent intermediate phases of hydrogen combustion
using the WISE drawing tool. In selection, students select four drawings among twelve to model the reaction
processes. We hypothesized that drawing helps students learn from the visualization because it encourages them

to distinguish among ideas and enables them to realize flaws in their previous interpretations. The selection
activity also requires distinguishing among ideas.

     Figure 1 Left: a screenshot of the online drawing tool. Students create four pictures to represent four
 intermediate phases during hydrogen combustion; Right: a screenshot of the selection activity. Students select
       four pictures from twelve to represent four intermediate phases during hydrogen combustion.

       Eighth graders (N=172, six classes) in a public middle school were assigned to either drawing (n=83)
or selection (n=89) conditions. Students in both conditions spent 40 minutes interacting with the visualization
and working on the drawing or selection tasks as part of the week-long project. Comparing student performance
on the posttest with pretest as covariate shows that both groups gained understanding [t(171)=21.45, p<.0001,
effect size=1.64] and performed equally well [F (1, 169)=1.72, p=.19]. This suggests that both drawing and
selection support student learning.
       Using pretest drawing performance,     we    grouped    students  based on knowledge  integration rubrics
(F igure 2). We found that selection and drawing have similar impact on students with high [t(16)=.36, p=.73]
and low [t(80)=.78, p=.44] levels of integrated ideas before the project. For students with partially integrated
ideas (medium level), drawing is less effective than selection [t(71)=2.25, p<.05].

Overall this study reveals that it is crucial to encourage students to distinguish among ideas when learning with
visualizations. Drawing prompts learners to distinguish among ideas currently in their repertoire. For students
who started with incorrect or no ideas about chemical reactions, drawing enables them to realize the
insufficiency of their previous understanding and prompts them to revisit the visualization for new ideas. For
students who had some correct ideas, selection requires them to analyze new ideas represented in the choices
and distinguish among their own ideas and new views. Compared to drawing, selection may add ideas and
enable students to develop criteria for distinguishing ideas.

Improving learning by drawing
Shaaron Ainsworth, School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD
Email: shaaron.ainsworth@nottingham.ac.uk

Drawing to learn can be a very successful way to help learners engage with complex concepts. For example, it
can help people observe, plan writing, improve memory, reduce anxiety, increase motivation, etc (Van Meter &
Garner, 2005). However, Leutner, Leopold & Sumfleth (2009) found that drawing after reading significantly
decreased performance. Moreover, research shows that learners benefit from support during drawing. The form
this support has taken includes task instruction to focus on specific aspects of the task (Alesandrini, 1981),
providing pre-existing materials such as scenes and cut-outs (Lesgold, Levin, Shimron, & Guttman, 1975) or
complete drawings for learners to compare with their own (Van Meter, 2001). This often leads to improved
outcomes. For example, Van Meter, Aleksic, Schwartz, & Garner, (2006) compared children learning from a
science text when they either read an illustrated text, read then drew, read, drew and then saw illustrations or
finally read, drew and saw illustration combined with prompts to compare to their own drawings. Sixth grade
children how received support in the drawing process outperformed students in the other conditions on tests of
problem solving knowledge. However, studies such as these are unclear as to the extent to which the benefits
come from active interpretation of multiple representations (itself often associated with improved learning, .
Ainsworth, 2006).  Consequently,   this paper  summarises    studies which    have  explored  whether   learning by
drawing from  written text which   describe the structure   and  function  of   the cardio-vascular  system can  be
improved without providing additional pictures. Two different approaches have been trialed: a) encouraging
active processing of the text prior to drawing; and b) altering the audience of the intended drawing.
        There  are many ways    to improve  text comprehension       but one  strategy  that has been  found to  be
particularly effective is that of self-explanation (e.g. Chi, 2000). When learners self explain, they go beyond the
information in the written text to generate inferences that help them construct new knowledge. Self explanation
thus helps learners to overcome gaps in the presented material or helps them build more accurate and complete
mental models. A   drawing  of  self-explained text may    then  reflect this new   knowledge    in an external and
consequently inspectable visualisation, leveraging graphical representations known benefits of computational
offloading (e.g. Scaife & Rogers, 1996) which could in turn prompt new self-explanations (e.g. Ainsworth &
Loizou, 2003). Additionally, drawings due to their specificity and perceptual advantages may provide learners
with complementary insights to those provide by the self-explanation process. Examples from a pilot study are
shown below which suggest that self-explanation may indeed support drawing as those constructed after self-
explanation are typically and contain more transformations of the original text .

        The second series of studies have taken their inspiration from researchers who have studied writing as
they have long recognised that the social context of the writing (including a writer3s collaborators and their
intended audience) will shape the process and outcomes of writing (Flower & Hayes, 1981). However, in the
context of drawing this has received relatively little attention to date (although see Schwartz (1995) for an
exception whereby drawers who worked in dyads created more abstract visualisations than those who worked
alone). My research has asked learners to draw an explanation for themselves, for a peer or has asked them to

Analysis of the pilot studies suggest that all three forms of instruction help students learn (although as they were
conducted with slightly different materials and tests no direct comparisons can be made as to their relative
effectiveness). It also suggests that distinctly different drawings emerge in the three different conditions.
Explanations created for peers (rather than for oneself) tend to be judged as clearer and contain both more

content, do include more inferences and even indications of monitoring (ticks and question marks added to the
diagram. Typically, learners who create self-explanation diagrams first directly translate the text content to the
diagram and then either annotate or amend the diagram to contain these inferences.
       These preliminary studies suggest that learning by drawing can be supported by strategies that
encourage learners to actively process the material and then reflect their new understanding in the drawing.
Current research is now extending these studies by gathering systematic evidence on the relation between
different forms of support for drawing, the process of drawing and learning outcomes.

Drawings are commonly used in the assessment (e.g., Magnusson, Krajcik & Borko, 1999) or spontaneous
articulation of scientific knowledge (e.g., Kinfield, 1993). As an activity, drawing has been shown to enhance
some forms of learning and comprehension (Ainsworth et al., 2007; Gobert & Clement, 1999; Van Meter &
Garner, 2005; Zhang & Linn, 2008). Yet learners regularly bump up against inherent constraints of the static,
two-dimensional medium for conveying three-dimensional information and time-varying, dynamic processes,

common  ground, interlocutors may  insist on modifications      and  standardizations to drawings   used       during
collaborative problem solving (e.g., rules of linear perspective; Nathan, Eilam & Kim, 2007).
       We were explicitly interested in the ways that college students learning about a scientific system of
moderate complexity, the circulatory system, used drawings to depict their understandings after a self-guided
(approx. 25 minutes), computer-based tutorial (following Butcher, 2005). Our analysis here focuses on how
gesture and speech were employed in the service of the drawings as students explained them to an observer. We
report here on the findings from two participants (supplemented by video in the presentations.)

        Students may produce simple drawings that are similar in appearance (Figure 4) but mask wildly
different mental models of the circulatory system. Figure 4a (Student A27) shows arrows entering the right and
left atria at the top and arrows exiting the ventricles at the bottom. While pointing gestures index drawn and
labeled elements such as the chambers and walls, no explanation of a time-varying process is provided, resulting
in a very low score for the model (2 points out of 6). In contrast, Figure 4b (Student A14) shows a very similar
drawing, with less detail (no labels) but through gesture and speech provides a rich account of the blood flow
following two distinct pathways (from heart to lungs and back, and from heart to body and back) that receives a

with arrows and labels suggesting the occurrence and direction of dynamic processes have limited assessment

of drawings for knowledge assessment, we find that these multimodal constructions (psychological units to
Vygotsky, 1986; growth points to McNeill, 1992; composite signals to Engle, 1998; and semiotic nodes to
Radford et al., 2003) are particularly evident when conveying time-varying phenomenon and causal relations.

Dynamic computer modelling is a valuable way to learn about complex dynamic systems (Löhner, van
Joolingen, Savelsbergh, & van Hout-Wolters, 2005; Spector, 2000). In a modelling task, students create an
executable model in order to build and express their understanding of scientific phenomenona. Once the model
is built, the data it produces can be compared to the expected or observed behaviour. The model can be modified
depending on the outcome of this evaluation (Penner, 2001). Despite its benefits modelling is often experienced
as difficult for students. For instance, students often fail at successful modelling behavior, because they do not
use their prior knowledge while working on an inquiry modelling task (Sins, Savelsbergh, & Van Joolingen,
2005). Such observations highlight the need to support the modelling process. In the present paper, descriptions
of drawing sketches of the modelled system as a means to support modelling are presented. Two approaches can
be distinguished: drawing to prepare the model and drawing the model itself.

modelling. A sketch can be used to identify relevant variables and relations between variables. Figure 5 displays
a sketch of a water tank that is then converted into a System Dynamics model. The drawing helps the learner to
identify the relevant variables in the system, such as water level and outflow. These variables can then be
converted into variables in the model. The drawing helps in this way with activating prior knowledge, and in
constraining the model, based on the drawn elements. A sketch-based modelling tool can provide support in
transforming a sketch into a model for instance by labelling model elements in the drawing.

view (Kenbeek, Van Joolingen, & De Jong, submitted), yielding complementary sets of variables to include in
the model. Apparently drawing guide learners in making their views on the domain more explicit.
         Alternatively, the learner-created sketch can be regarded as a model in itself. The drawing will not be

phenomenon. In this case the drawing must adhere to some formal aspects, such as clear identification of objects
in the drawing and their properties. Forbus and Usher (2002) put the burden of doing this with the learner who
needs to identify the start and end of drawing and object (glyph in their terminology) and select a term from an
ontology to  describe the  object. The approach    presented  here  automates  object  identification by  clustering
strokes based on time, position, color and weight. A 95% agreement with human raters is reached using this
method based on a set of drawings created by 37 students on two domains, a toy car (e.g. Figure 6) and a heating
system (Leenaars, Bollen, & Van Joolingen, submitted). Sketch recognition techniques (Paulson & Hammond,
2008) can then assist object identification which can result in a formal model.

         Figure 6. Drawing of the toy car system. Colors indicate automatic clustering results.

         These two approaches provide a promising outlook on the use of drawings to support the complex task
of modelling. The drawings collected in the two studies P for different purposes and in different domains, show

approaches   form a   set of stepping  stones that can    be  used  to support  the  development   of  a  modelling
competency by novice modellers.
