          A bstract: In this study, we use evidence fromstudents in grades 10-12 (N = 148) to document the
        ways in which children learn about and model their conceptual understandingof magnetism. Our
        model-based    design  capitalizes  on  phenomena      that are engaging  to students,  to describe the
        behavior of magnetic materials across scale, from the familiar to the nanoscale. Data are drawn
        from written responses to pre- and post-questionnaires, embedded assessments, activity journal
        pages,   and  informal  interviews,    to describe   a   progression of   stu!"#$%&' ("#$)*' (+!"*%  of

        learning. An implication of this work is that it may be used to inform leve-lappropriate strategies
        for both instruction and assessmentfor the study of magnetism acrossscale.

Introduction
Magnetism is long standing staple of science curricula from grades K-12 and beyond. It is a phenomenon that
fascinates and   interests students  of all ages.  ,"$' -"' .#+-' %/0102%2#3*4' *2$$*"' )5+/$' 1"+1*"&%' 6+#6"1$2+#%' +7'
magnetism    (Hickey  &    Schibeci, 1999;  Maloney,   1985),    nor  have  conceptions   of magnetic    phenomena   been
investigated as intensively as other physical phenomena such as electricity, force and heat (Borges & Gilbert, 1998;
Erikson, 1994; Hickey & Schibeci, 1999).

Learning   about nanomagnetism,    for  example,  provides   a means   of  not only  introducing concepts   of nanoscale
science to children, but it is a vehicle to reinforce and apply science concepts already existing in the curriculum.
        The   concepts  of  magnetism    pose a   challenge  for learners; they require  higher levels of cognition  and
mental imagery than more concrete and tangible concepts(Barrow, 1987; Borges & Gilbert, 1998; Guisasola,et al.,
2004). The idea of an object causing a force to be exertedon another without touching, or reasons whyan object
could be attracted toward either end of a magnet are counterintuitive for children (Constantinou, et al., 2001).
Children commonly believe that magnets are electrically charged, and that electrostatic and magnetic interactions
are the same (Borges & Gilbert, 1998; Haupt, 1952; Maloney, 1985). Many students may also believe that the
magnetic field has a finite boundary (Bar, et al., 1997), or that the field lines are a concrete entity (Guisasola, et al.,
2004; Guth & Pegg, 1994). Understanding these concepts requires the ability to construct mental models of absrtact
concepts, such as spatial orientation, noncontact forcesand the particle nature of matter.
        The goal of our research is to describe the increasingly sophisticated ways in which students construct
mental models about magnetism. We will show how a limited number of key benchmarkconcepts, through guided
inquiry, mental imagery, and metacognitive reflection, can enable students to develop a deeper and more intuitive
understanding of magnetism and magnetic phenomena, both in the realm of the familiar, as well as atthe nanoscale.

Theoretical Framework
This work is based on a developmental view of learning, ;!":"*+12#3'0"*)$2+#%')(+#3')'<0"*)$2:"*4'7"-='%"$'+7'6+0"'
6+#6"1$%'$80+/38+/$'%68++*2#3> (Catley, Lehrer & Reiser, 2005, p, 8). These concepts provide targets for learning,
accessible to younger students yet still a challenge for in-depth understanding at later grades (Lehrer & Schauble,
2004). Wiggins & McTighe (2006) characterize these core concepts as linchpin ideas - those concepts within a
content domain that have enduring value throughout and at multiple levels with the domain, providing conceptual
anchors for construction of knowledge and a basis for assessment.

         We  also draw   from the  literature on mental    models and  model-based  learning.  As a  representation of
something in the absence of the real thing (Greca & Moriera, 1997,) mental models provide a lens through which
levels of understanding and cognitive sophistication, relative to a target concept, may be approximatedM. odel-based
learning presumes   that through  the process  of  generating, critiquing  and   revising  our mental  models  we   can
approach a more coherent and normative understanding C( lement & Steinberg, 2002; Coll, France, & Taylor, 2005;
Lehrer & Schauble, 2006; White & Frederiksen, 1998). Models are the dominant form of explanation in scienceand
learning science is to make, revise and justifyself-constructed models, not simplyto use models posed by others and
taken for granted (Lehrer, 2009).
         Mental models provide the learner a means to organize concepts ina way to help understand the world or to
explain it to others (Harrison & Treagust, 1996). In order to construct a coherent conceptual understanding of
scientific principles, learners must be able toformalize, assess and reflect upon, and justify their understanding of
scientific concepts as they develop them (Cavicchi, 1997; Clement, 1989; Clement & Steinberg, 2002). In the
process  of constructing a  mental  model  the   learner  reduces  a phenomenon    to  the elements  most   meaningful,

representation (Gilbert & Boulter, 1995).
         The  use of mental   models   generated  and  revised by  the student   while  learning and  revealed through
multiple inscriptions (Latour, 1990) will provide a lens through which both the researcher and learner will be able to
access the evolutionary nature and coherence of that cognitive process. The invention and revision of models, as an

occur quickly and often require repeated challenges,metacognitive reflection, andmultiple mixed models along the
way (Nussbaum & Novick, 1982).
         One of the impediments to understanding magnetism, especially magnetism at the nanoscale, is the concept
of the atom and the particle nature of matter. At the nanoscale the effect that thermalenergy has on particle motion
is manifested in the behavior of the material. The behavior of these materials is not only relevant to the realm
nanoscale science, but serves as a tool for connecting to and learning about the nature of magentism in general.

still believe that matter is continuous or that substances contain molecules rather than substances are composed of
molecules (Harrison & Treagust, 2002). A scientific understanding magnetism requires an understanding of the
particle nature of matter and the implications of thermal energyand applied forces on the appropriate hierarchy of
single or aggregate groups ofparticles (e.g. atom, domain, magnet).

helps to provide a big picture view of science and conceptual coherence of scientific concepts for students.The

Participants
The grade 10-12 high school students (N = 148) in this study comprised a non-random sample, solicited from two
high schools with which researchers had previously worked as constituents in a nanoscience teacher professional
development program. The classes were all high school physics classes; the majority (approximately 95%) of the
students in the classes were in the 11th grade (see Table 1).

Intervention
The series of lessons for the intervention will follow a cycle of mode-lbased inquiry in which students will make
predictions, conduct investigations, interpret results and apply their revised mental models to new siutations. During
the cycle of lessons, students will be provided multiple opportunities to reflect on and revise their mental models,
and to defend or revise them in light of new and possibly conflicting evidence.The series of lessons which will be
employed were designed by the researcher and are based on those concepts believed to be most salient to students
constructing a coherent understandingof magnetism and the behavior of magnetic materials across scale.

Data Sources
The data collected consisted of student responses topre- and posttest tests, inscriptions from embedded assessments,
activity journal pages, collaborative group artifacts and informal interviews. Our goal was not the assessment of
effectiveness of an intervention. Rather, we aimed $+' !+6/("#$' $8"' %$)$/%' )#!' 30+-$8' +7' %$/!"#$%&' ("#$)*' (+!"*%'
and explanations of magnetic phenomena through the normal course of classroom insturction by the classroom

magnetic interactions, magnetic versus      electrostatic  interactions, magnetic fields, domains, magnetizing  and
demagnetizing, and magnetism at the nanoscale. The assessment items were paper and pencil open ended response

Findings and Discussion
We describe our findings for the following categories: (a) magnetic materials and interactions; (b) magnetic fields;
(c) models of magnetization and magnetic domains; and (d) magnetism at the nanoscale.

Magnetic Materials and Interactions
Students initially conducted an inquiry designed to elicit their models of magnetic interactions and then made a
drawing of their own design to interprettheir findings. Interactions were typically classified as attractive, but not
necessarily repulsive, in various combinations of weak or strong (see Figure 1).Some students focused on the nature
of interactions, others by the materials involved.

The purpose of this initial lesson was to help students develop an awareness of degrees of magnetic attraction and/or
repulsion, how these interactions are observed, and what common materials exhibit these properties. Students re-
visited categories of magnetic   materials, the degree   of  response  and    the ability of some materials   to  remain
magnetized or not, in subsequent lessons.

Magnetic Fields
The detection  of  magnetic fields  was an  integral part  of our  lessons,   both for investigation   and as a  tool for
detection. The drawing of an iron filing diagramidentified a change in the space surrounding a magnet and provided
an overall concept of the both the geometry of the field and areas of more and less density. Students also discovered
during this activity the three dimensional nature of the field. Mapping the field with a compass provided students

         In previous  iterations we framed   this question   more  to  elicit conceptions    specific to magnetic fields.
However, we found that leaving the item more open for interpretation produced a broader range of responses.
Additionally, we found that the degree to which students might elaborate on their conception of the field helpde
provide a means for categorizing understanding. The most sophisticated models included enough field lines to
convey a greater density at the poles, the symmetric nature of the field, identification of poles and an indication of
direction. The role of the field in the alignment of the domains of a ferromagnetic object is a key concept that
recurred in subsequent lessons.

Magnetization and Magnetic Domains
We approached the concept of domains with a stepwise progression of investigations to help students construct, and
provide us access to, increasingly sophisticated mental models.At the end of the first investigation, categories of

                  Figure 3. Pre-instruction Models of Magnetized and Non-magnetized Nails
These models provided a beginning for the development of the concept of domains, fundamental in providing the
conceptual framework to understand how a nail, for example, can be attracted to either end of a magnet,why an
object can be magnetized, or why nanoscale materials do not stay magnetized.At key times throughout the lessons,
students referred to their initial models, confronting and revising them based on new evidence and their changing
conceptions. Posttest responses for the same students areshown in Figure 4.

de-magnetizing their magnet, observing the change in field with a compass.While students generally began to
associate being magnetized with a state of conditional ailgnment, we found that many still held on to their concept
of charge (see figure 5).

          The two inscriptions in Figure 5 are good examples of models between the pre- and post-instructional
models in Figures 3 and 4. Both of these models show an increased sophistication from the initial model, yet are
refined further during the remainder of the lessons, as the inscriptions in Figure 4demonstrate.
          After the straw magnet lesson, students from one group create a drawing for what they believed would
happen when a nail is approached by either end of a magnet (see Figure 6). The other group responded to a similar
question with a writtenresponse (see Table 3).

        The drawings by student MC-21 are a reasonable model of the alignment and reverse alignment of the
domains in the nail, subject to the field of the magnet. This student aligns the domains in the nail relative to the
magnet and indicates the action of the field.
Table 3: How a Paper Clip is Attracted to Either Side of a Magnet
 Level                     Key concepts
 More sophisticated        The magnet magnetizes the paper clip, whichmeans it causes the domains within it to be
                           lines up. The paper clip can be attracted to both ends of the magnet because both ends
                           will line up the domains. Therefore, one end of the magnet will line up the domains in
                           one direction and the other end will line them up in the other direction. (MC-66).
 Less sophisticated        The      domains of the paper    clip will shift  according to what  side  of  the magnet  is
                           presented allowing it to pick up the paper clip (MC-67).
The more sophisticated of the responses alluded to the alignment of domains, yet none of the students in our sample
referred to the concept the field in the action; the level of sophistication appeared to stall with the magnet causing
the effect. This is however neither surprising nor discouraging, given the limited time frame for instruction and the
abstract nature of the interaction.

Magnetism at the Nanoscale
The magnetic properties of nanoscale materials is grounded in two key concept:s(1) the dominance of the behavior
of a particle by the larger number of atoms on the surface of the particle relative to atoms in the interior compared to
microscale and macroscale objects, and (2) thermal effects which exceed the tendency for nanoscale domains to
remain aligned in the absence of a magnetic field. The investigation and explanation of the behavior exhibited by a
magnetic fluid (ferrofluid), ties together all of the concepts presented in the preceding lessons. Figure 7 shows two
student inscriptions, representative  of  two  levels of   sophistication,   applying observations from  the  nanoscale
material investigation withthe concepts theylearned.

Conclusion
This research represents a pilot study. Our goal was to begin to document a range and progression of sophistication
+7'%$/!"#$%&'("#$)*'(+!"*%'+7'()3#"$2%(B'0":")led through multiple and frequent inscriptions. We beleive that
through model-based learning, mentoring students to construct, metacognitively reflect on, and reform their mental
models, learners will approach a more coherent and normative understanding ocfoncepts of science. This study
serves as a starting point for further research thataims to develop cognitively grounded and research-based cohesive
physical science curricula organizedaround key theoretical principles.
          While we are encouraged by ourresults, we also recognize that learning about the nature of magnetic
interactions presents many cognitive challenges. In the case of domains, for examplew, e found that students
associate an element of alignment to a magnetized object, but that their undrestanding of that alignment might just as
likely reside at the atomic level, involve an electrical polarization, or may consist of an alignment which, while
similar to the concept of domains, appears more to be anartifact of composition. Students created multiple
inscriptions based on the concept of domains, yetappear to not have significantly grasped the concept that each
domain is in effect its own little magnet with its own magnetic field.
          The nature of nanomagnetic materials poses challenges in learning, both in terms of magnetic fields and
domains, but with the added layer of complexity of the particle nature of mater and kinetic molecular theoryW. e
found, for example, that some students believe that atoms in a nanometer size piece of iron are smaellr and closer
together than in a larger piece. That notwithstanding, the impact of thermal vibrations on the alignment of the atoms
in a single (nanoscale) domain was accurately described by a large portion of students. A kinesthetic activity in
which students in a group each modeled an atom proved a tangible way to compare surface to volume and the effect
of thermal vibrations.
          Similar to the findings of Cheng and Brown (2007), we also found that students reverted to prior models in
the abeyance of newer more fruitful ones and the tendency to rely too heavily on concrete interpretations of models
used for explanatory purposes. Effects of thermal energy or mechanical shock, or droppinga nail to demagnetize it,
are often believed by students to physically translate the atoms in the material, rather than to disorient their magnetic
alignment. The distinction is confounded, however, with the observation of a magnetic fluid in which the domain
particles actually do translate inthe absence of a field.
          We believe that the study of magnetism provides as meaningful framework and engaging segue for the
introduction of nanoscience and of the size dependent nature of materials at the nanoscal.eFurther study of the ways
in which students conceptualize magnetic phenomena across scale, and the cognitive pathways by which those
conceptions are able to progress toward greater levels of sophistication will not only provide a descriptive account of
learning, but may   also  inform instruction. In addition,   we   believe that evidence  suggests that magnetism   is a
meaningful and authentic way in which nanoscience can be introduced to serve xeisting standards and curricula.
