        discipline. Using a theoretical framework based on the current research perspectives on informal science
        learning, learning science in the context of the local community, and research on communities of practice,
        we examine how apprentices develop an identity in science while also strengthening ties to their own
        community.

Issues Addressed!
Our research   follows adolescent youth through   a year-long     community-based   science apprenticeship  program  (CBSA),
composed of their peers and members of an oceanographic lab on a large university campus in the Pacific Northwest. The
program aims to positively influence the learning trajectory of adolescent apprentices from groups that are underrepresented
in the sciences; engage the local community in scientific inquiry through community relevant, researchable questions; and
cultivate and showcase the scientific skills and interests of the youth apprentices through presentations of findings through
public venues. The guiding research questions are: How does the identity of individual apprentices as science learners shift
over the course of their participation in a CBSA? How does their sense of the scientific enterprise change?

Potential Significance
Understanding how adolescent apprentices begin to solidify a scientific identity while leveraging that identity within their
own community has implications for future study design in informal science learning. This research can help to bridge the
gap between school and community science and provide a new framework for practitioners, as well as for future research.

Theoretical Framework
In order to serve as a bridge between school and community, informal science programs must be culturally-responsive, utilize
cognitive apprenticeship models, and focus on authentic, interrelated science practices.
        The program should be tailored to the needs, interests and values of the local community (NRC, 2009). Project
stakeholders partner to identify specific mentoring supports, educational experiences, and research activities. The focus on
youth science learning in CBSA is based on prior approaches taken in ocean science education research (Tzou, Scalone
&Bell, submitted).
        CBSA is premised on a cognitive apprenticeship model in which novices develop an understanding of disciplinary
thinking and practices through scaffolded inquiry, structured feedback, and guidance from more expert mentors (Collins,
Brown & Holum, 1991). Participation in bona fide ocean science research projects associated with a university-led citizen
science effort allows apprentices to identify and investigate hypotheses of interest to them. Learning trajectories must be
considered  long-term  pursuits associated with   deepening    participation and   emergent problems over   multiple years            of
involvement in disciplinary research and learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991).
        CBSA participants include youth from non-dominant groups and scientists who are primarily from the dominant
cultural group. Thus, there is a critical need for cultural bridging among participants in order to promote a generative and
inclusive educational experience for the youth apprentices (Banks, et al., 2007; Bell, et al., 2006). Educational supports must
be responsive and appropriate in order to promote the academic achievement of youth from historically non-dominant groups
(Banks, et al., 2007; Gordon, Bridglall & Meroe, 2004).

Data Collection
Data collection will include three parts:
         Baseline, pre interviews with participants about their familiarity with water quality, their interests in environmental
         science, and their academic and career goals science.
         Videorecording    of  social interactions.    The   primary    data  collection   activity of   the study   will  consist of
         videorecording   the  youth  apprentices     across settings  of   the scientific work:    in data  collection, analysis  and
         interpretation, and in public events related to disseminating findings. As we are interested in how participation in
         particular scientific activities  relates to understanding    the  scientific enterprise   and identity in science, we   will

         Research findings are still emergent. Initial insights suggest that apprentices see only vague connections between
science and their local communities. Their understanding of science is that it is something that happens in a classroom or a
lab and  requires expertise  in specific   scientific domains.   We    anticipate that through  participation  in this   program,  this
distinction will begin to blur- that apprentices will begin to recognize their place in the scientific community, and the science
in their local community.  !
