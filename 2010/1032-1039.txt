Introduction
In  the past few years  science  education    has turned   toward   learning  progressions  as  an  organizing   concept   for

grade levels, topics, and aspects of science. Some LPs focus narrowly, such as on celestial motion (Plummer &
Slagle, 2009). Others   focus  broadly,  such  as  the  LP  for  atomic-molecular    theory  (Smith,   Wiser,  Anderson,    &
Krajcik, 2006). L'"%"($%"($3#.(KM#(:.&,#)*7(.*(#-,+"*-#G("*7$7"0"*-()*(0.+"3)*7(>N&'H$%O8(!")#"%8(P$/)#8(Q"*4.*8(
Acher, Fortus et al., 2009) and other scientific inquiry practices. In addition to articulating these descriptions of
progress, researchers have designed a variety of supporting materials for LPs, including assessment instruments,
curricula, and instructional strategies.
         Work on LPs has proceeded apace, as reported in a dedicated conference (Alonzo & Gotwals, 2009), a
special journal issue (Hmelo-Silver & Duncan, 2009), a chapter in a National Research Council publication (NRC,
2007), and at least one literature review (Salinas, 2009). Recently, a working panel identified and discussed learning
progressions from at least twenty different research projects, in part to define a common set of guidelines for future
LPs (Corocoran, Mosher, & Rogat, 2009). Some researchers are even looking ahead to ways that LPs could be used
to inform curricula and professional development (see for example Corrigan, Loper, Barber, Brown, & Kulikowich,
2009; Furtak, 2009).
         Given   the  speed at which     the community     has adopted   the  notion of a   learning   progression, it is  not
surprising that there are variations in how that notion is understood. Much in particular depends on how educators
understand "increasingly sophisticated," and in this there is tension over whether to focus on disciplinary knowledge
or  on  disciplinary practices (Hodson,   1988;   Hutchison    &  Hammer,     2009). To focus   on  the  former, we    should
consider an idea more sophisticated if it comes closer to current scientific understanding. To focus on the latter, we
should consider an idea more sophisticated if it was generated and defended in ways that more closely resemble
scientific practices, based  on  the  evidence    and  reasoning    available to  students. That   is, in considering     what
constitutes increasing sophistication, what aspect of the discipline should have priority?
         Much   depends  as  well  on  how    educators conceptualize    what  constitutes  progress.  In this there   is also
tension, much of it tacit, over whether to expect a linear progression from one way or level of understanding to
another, or whether to expect a variety of learning paths. Most advocates of LPs explicitly endorse the latter, but in
practice published LPs more typically describe a sequence of levels.
         In this paper we offer a critical review of three learning progressions, in student understanding of (1)
heredity (Roseman et al., 2006), (2) force and motion (Alonzo & Steedle, 2008), and (3) matter (Carraher, Smith,
Wiser, Schliemann, Cayton-Hodges, 2009; Wiser, Smith, Doubler, & Asbell-Clarke, 2009). The authors in each case
are prominent  researchers  on  learning     progressions, and   as a  set, these LPs reflect   a range   of approaches   and
perspectives with respect to assessing sophistication and conceptualizing progress. We begin with a summary of
each progression with respect to its scope, development, and substance.

Three Learning Progressions

(Roseman et al., 2006, p. 1). The learning progression spans grades K-12, but the authors describe in more detail the
sequence of ideas they propose students encounter in high school.

other standards documents, as well as on their own evaluation of the discipline and education research studies, to
identify potential sequences of scientific ideas that could lead to an understanding of heredity. Roseman et al. (2006)

       offspring to resemble their parents, there must be a reliable way to transfer information from one
       generation to the next. In high school, with their prior knowledge of cells and protein molecules,
       students are ready to learn about the link between proteins and DNA and, hence, between DNA
       and traits. (Roseman et al., 2006, p. 2)

The authors provide a similar description for studentsG progressively more sophisticated understanding of the first
function of DNA.

Alonzo & Steedle (2008): Force and Motion
Alonzo &  Steedle   (2008)  are developing    a learning      progression  to serve   as an  interpretive framework  for
assessment. This LP is designed to "diagnose" students' understanding of force and motion, particularly after an
introductory unit on the topic (p. 3).

Alonzo & Steedle (2008) used the National Science Education Standards for eighth grade to inform their initial
hypothesis, specifically to define the highest level of the LP. They also conducted a review of the literature to

four kinds of problems: force or no force, and motion or no motion. The LP also includes anticipated common errors
at each level. For example:

       Level 2
       Student believes that motion implies a force in the direction of motion and that nonmotion implies
       no force. Conversely, student believes that force implies motion in the direction of the force.
               Force: If a force is acting upon an object, it is moving.
                            2A: The force acting on an object could be the initial force (which is carried
                            with the object and may dissipate over time).
               No Force: If no force is acting upon an object, it is not moving.
               Motion: If an object is moving, a force is acting upon it.
               No Motion: If an object is not moving, no force is acting upon it.
       Common Errors:
           [   If there is no motion, there are no forces acting.
           [   When an object is moving, there is a force in the direction of its motion.
                    !       2A: This motion could be the force that put the object into motion initially. !
                    !       2A: This object may come to rest because the force it carries with it has been
                            used up. (Alonzo & Steedle, 2008, p. 16-17) !

In addition to creating descriptions of each level in the LP, Alonzo & Steedle have developed associated assessment
items for diagnosing students' levels on the progression.

The Inquiry Project: Matter
The Inquiry Project is currently conducting research on 3rd-5th grade students' reasoning about matter, material,
weight, volume, and density, in part to contribute to a learning progression on the nature of matter (Smith, Wiser,
Anderson, & Krajcik, 2006). The group has yet to publish a complete LP for these grades. However, two recent
Inquiry Project publications (Carraher, Smith, Wiser, Schliemann, Cayton-Hodges, 2009; Wiser, Smith, Doubler, &
Asbell-Clarke, 2009) describe in detail the project's work on developing such a progression.
       Wiser et al. (2009) frame the problem of designing a learning progression as follows:

       how many ways can the knowledge network evolve (when characterized at the level of concepts
       and beliefs)? (p. 4).

3rd-5th grade students' progression in reasoning about matter will involve two interrelated changes:

       [   A gradual shift from (a) perception-centered thinking, that is, understanding and explanation

           related concepts and scientific habits of mind.

students' (those exposed to a traditional curriculum) and treatment students' (those exposed to the Inquiry Project
curriculum) ideas about matter-related concepts (see Carraher et al., 2009).
         The Inquiry Project is currently in the process of gathering and analyzing data. They have confirmed some
aspects of the lower anchor of their LP, for example, that "the distinction between material kind and weight are
sporadic and context-dependent" (Wise%("-($3C8(?@@E8(5C(EBC(L'"($,-'.%#($%"(H.%2)*7(-.("#-$;3)#'(-'"(6)*-"%0"+)$-"9(

Sophistication and Progress
Despite the variety of definitions of learning progression circulating in the literature, they all share a general sense
that LPs describe how students become more sophisticated with respect to some aspect of science (Salinas, 2009).
Roseman et al. (2006) design sequences of concepts in the canon based on disciplinary knowledge as mapped by
Project 2061. Alonzo & Steedle (2008) hypothesize, test, and refine sequences of student conceptions using both
disciplinary knowledge   and   research on  learning. Wiser et     al. (2009)   are looking  for  sequences of    student
conceptions interwoven with epistemologies and practices of science. Our focus in this critical review is on how
each of these LPs assesses "sophistication" and on how each conceptualizes the dynamics of progress.

Assessing Sophistication
It may be educational common sense that what students learn should be correct knowledge, beginning with simpler,
more foundational ideas and building from there to more complex, difficult material. Children learn to count, then to
add, later to multiply, and so on. Roseman et al. (2006)'s work is designed around that view of knowledge and
progress. In their LP, the canonical ideas themselves constitute the pathways of learning, and these pathways are
therefore naturally towards more complete, correct understandings (Furtak, 2009).
         Alonzo & Steedle (2008), on the other hand, create a learning progression not from canonical ideas, but
from  students' ideas, both correct and  incorrect. In    this respect,  the two    LPs are quite  different. Roseman et
al. (2006) do not include students' alternative conceptions in their LP, a difference that we explore further in the
section "Conceptualizing   the Dynamics   of   Progress.9    With  respect   to their determinations  of sophistication,
however, the two LPs are similar. According to Alonzo & Steedle (2008), the force and motion LP describes

         the thinking that students at that level could be expected to exhibit, including both the correct
         ideas that can be carried to the next level and the misconceptions that will need to be revised
         before students can reach the next level (p. 4).

Like Roseman et al., Alonzo & Steedle take "more sophisticated" to mean "more correct," that is more completely
aligned with the target canonical understanding.
         There are several reasons, however, to question the educational common sense that student learning should
proceed as a sequence of conceptual attainments. First, such a sequence has not generally characterized progress
within the sciences. Unlike basic ideas of arithmetic, which have been stable for millennia, basic ideas within
science have gone through dramatic change. Concepts of life, matter, and energy that are foundational today were
relatively recent constructions. (That life arises only from other life and the concept of energy are less than 200
years old; the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a notable exception, although the modern understanding of
atoms as opposed to molecules is quite young.)
         Moreover, it has happened often in science that the formation of a wrong idea has been generative for later
progress. For example, the Caloric Theory treated heat as an invisible substance that is contained in hot objects and
can flow into from them to cold objects. That incorrect idea was a stepping stone toward differentiating heat as an
extensive quantity from temperature as an intensive quantity, as well as toward understanding energy as conserved
(Chang, 2004). That is, the formation of a wrong idea may be a productive development in science. By including
only correct concepts in their LP, Roseman et al. (2006) systematically omit the possibility of productive, incorrect
ideas. And although their conceptualization of LPs does not necessitate it, Alonzo and Steedle (2008) do something
similar by including among their hypotheses only sequences that become more correct over time.
         Second,  research  on science  learning  has  come     to understand   that  progress is not  entirely, or even
primarily, about correct concepts. Indeed, the original emphasis of misconceptions research was that students' wrong
ideas are often rational in ways that are constructive of scientific practices (Strike & Posner, 1985); in subsequent
years Strike  and Posner   (1994) specifically revised    their discussion   of  misconceptions   to emphasize   -'$-( 6if

overlook other aspects of those ecologies.
         One outcome of a focus on 6%)7'-($*#H"%#9()#(-'$-, in the practices of assessment and instruction it encourages,
students may learn  to assess   ideas by   their  alignment with  the  canon rather  than by    fit with  the  evidence and
reasoning they have available (Coffey, in preparation). That is to say, measures of sophistication organized around
alignment with the canon are often at odds with assessments of quality by the practices of science. How, for
example,  should  a teacher think  about   a student's  progress   who    develops  an account   of  inheritance  based  on
evidence of how a mother's behavior and health during her pregnancy affects offspring characteristics? That account
may differ greatly from canonical understanding, but the student's reasoning in producing it may reflect nascent
scientific practices of generating ideas from evidence and reasoning.
         For a number of years, the field has moved toward conceptualizing students' progress in science in ways
that consider engagement in disciplinary practices (Engle & Conant, 2002; Ford, 2005). Progress in that engagement

the macroscopic level, of weight, volume, material, mass, and density, and their interrelations, consistent with the
expert view", or (ii) a particulate model of matter (Wiser et al., 2009, p. 10). The researchers opted for option (ii).
That is, students are permitted to continue with their non-canonical ideas about mass and weight, for example, in
order to pursue melting, freezing, evaporating, and a host of other phenomena explainable by particulate models of
matter. The authors predict that pursuing a particulate model for matter will be more interesting to students, align

      It is unclear, however, whether the Inquiry Project will allow students' non-canonical models of matter to act
as stepping stones in their progression. Allowing the development of non-canonical, but productive models is not
prevalent in learning progressions literature, though Stevens, Shin, & Krajcik (2009) and Corcoran et al. (2009) for
example suggest that non-&$*.*)&$3(0.+"3#(0)7'-('"35(#-,+"*-#G(0./"(-.H$%+#(,55"%($*&'.%(,*+"%#-$*+)*7C Wiser
et al. (2009) appear to be struggling with this aspect of the development of their LP:

         A central issue is exactly what set of elements to include in a particulate model and how to
         introduce  them in a   way   that helps   students   understand  deeper   epistemological   issues   about
         models, including their tentative revisable nature and their use as tools of inquiry. (p. 11)

This is an essential challenge for research on learning progressions: Conceptual understanding is only part of a
complex dynamic, and LPs that treat it as a separable component may direct educational attention in such a way as
to interfere with a healthy, productive cognitive and metacognitive ecology. Understanding the mind as a complex,
dynamic ecology challenges another feature of LPs as well, namely the idea that students' conceptual knowledge can
be characterized by levels. We turn to that aspect of our critique now.

Conceptualizing the Dynamics of Progress
A working panel on learning progressions recently suggested that any 'good learning progression' should contain a
levels-like description of students' knowledge:

         Levels of achievement that are intermediate steps in the developmental pathway(s) traced by the
         learning  progression. These   levels    may reflect   levels of integration  or common        stages that
         characterize the development of student thinking. (Corcoran, Mosher, & Rogat, 2009, p. 38)

                                                      1036      ISLS

Many groups have taken levels-based approaches to constructing LPs (see for example Mohan, Chen, & Anderson,
2009; Plummer & Slagle, 2009). A levels-based LP prov)+"#($*(.%7$*)O)*7(#-%,&-,%"(:.%(67%.,5)*7(#)0)3$%(#"-#(.:(

2008, p. 5). For example, Alonzo & Steedle's LP consists of five levels, each describing a qualitatively distinct way
that students might think about force and motion. The progression also suggests a possible pathway for "how student
understanding develops"Tthat is, from one qualitatively distinct level to the next (Alonzo & Steedle, 2008, p. 30).
        There are several reasons, however, to question a levels-based approach to characterizing students' progress
in science. In their work on validating the force and motion learning progress, Alonzo & Steedle (2008) highlight
one potential problem: levels may not adequately describe the state of students' knowledge.

        Research on learning in science has been moving toward complex, dynamic views of cognition (Strike &

knowledge as manifold, context-sensitive, and coupled to and embedded in the social and physical environment.
Scherr (2008) for example documented how a college student could easily distinguish mass and density in one
context, but conflated them in another. Frank (2009) documented multiple stabilities in how groups of students

        Evidence that student knowledge is generally not well characterized as level-like at any point in time,
clearly, raises questions regarding LPs composed of a succession of qualitatively different levels of knowledge or
understanding. According to Corcoran, Mosher, & Rogat (2009), the levels approach

        stems from a structural view of cognitive development which suggests that the development of
        student thinking may  not   be purely incremental     but may    proceed as a series of increasingly
        complex  schemes  for organizing  understanding      of  the world  which may  be rather  stable      for
        periods of time, but which   eventually are modified      or even  broken down  and  rebuilt to  take
        account of new evidence and new perceptions... (p. 18)

        That structural view is at odds with evidence of contextual sensitivity in student reasoning. Identifying levels of
conceptual understanding becomes even more problematic when we consider views of how different aspects of

along two just dimensions: i) content knowledge of biodiversity and ii) generating evidence-based explanations.
Songer, Kelcey, & Gotwals (2009) present one solution: create an LP for concepts in biodiversity, create a separate

complexity of the interaction. Lehrer & Schauble (2009) make this point succinctly in their commentary:

        We hope that Songer et al. will elaborate the meaning of complexity of explanation...We suspect
        that complexity interacts with the nature of the knowledge of biodiversity being assessed, and a
        syntactic definition may miss this interaction. (p. 732)

      For an example from physics, understanding the Newtonian concept of force (or mass, or energy) is in

and working to construct underlying principles that govern all experience within a domain. Learning the concept
involves participating in that practice; and for many students coming to a first appreciation of that practice happens
in learning Newtonian mechanics. The inquiry practices and the conceptual understanding are inseparable.

Concluding Remarks
Our purpose in this presentation has been to lay on critical brakes to the adoption of learning progressions as the
organizing concept and language for research on learning. By reviewing LPs constructed by several prominent
groups, we hope to have illustrated how at least some LPs assume progress occurs as a sequence of conceptual
attainments, monotonically increasing toward the end-state disciplinary view. Research in science education has
slowly made progress toward views .:(3"$%*"%#G(2*.H3"+7"($*+(%"$#.*)*7()*($(&.053"I(&.*&"5-,$38(0"-$&.*&"5-,$38(

construct for organizing work does not set that progress aside.
