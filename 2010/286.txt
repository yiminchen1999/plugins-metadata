         and assessment can be structured in immersive virtual game environments called Massively
         Multi-Player Online Games (MMOG). In doing so, we examine the sources of evidence from
         which learning and assessment activities are derived in MMOGs, offering examples of how
         multiple  evidence  channels  in operation   through   game-based    activities can be utilized  to
         construct rich data trails for assessment.

Sources of evidence in MMOGs
A growing body of literature points to the value of a sub-type of virtual worlds-based game called the Massively
Multi-Player  Online  Game   (MMOG)       for engagement     and   learning. Researchers   investigating educational
MMOGs have explored the design, functionality, and learning impact of such environments, focusing primarily
on analysis and evaluation of the curricula embedded in them (e.g. Nelson & Ketelhut, 2007; Nelson, 2007).         In
this poster, we approach the issue from a different analytical framework, examining the kinds of activities
supported by virtual worlds, with a particular focus on how such activities may provide meaningful data for
assessment.
         In spite of the sensory and situational complexity of MMOGs, there are relatively small numbers of
possible recordable interactions supported by the environments from which researchers can gather data relevant
to assessment. These interactions provide data via what we define as Global Evidence Channels. These evidence
channels track  learner  activities in  three  main   categories:   Location/Movement,      Object   Interaction, and
Communication Activities (Table 1).

Location/Movement
The exploration of virtual worlds by learners offers a rich source of direct and indirect evidentiary data that can
be mined by researchers, educators, and evaluators. By tracking locations visited and the patterns of movements
of learners through  a  virtual world  over   time,  researchers   can assemble  a historical  trail which   provides
information about the moment to moment learning of those students.
         In creating MMOG-based      assessments,    designers  can  plot out  assessment  hotspot   locations in  the
virtual worlds. Each hotspot can contain opportunities for interactions that help indicate the learning state of a
player at that point in space and time. The sequence of location visits within a carefully designed world can also
provide  evidence  about the state  of knowledge     construction  in  a given domain    among  groups   of  learners.
Related to the location evidence collection supported by MMOGs is         movement-based evidence. Examining the
direction, speed, and duration of travel within a virtual world designed to elicit evidentiary activity can provide
data on student learning over time.

Object Interaction
A second channel of evidence supported by MMOGs is Object Interaction. Object interaction occurs in two
main ways in MMOGs: simple viewing of objects in 3-D space and direct interaction with objects, i.e. selecting,
clicking on, rotating, picking up, moving, or dropping objects in the MMOG world. Within these two categories,

with objects without clear purpose. In this mode, they click on all visible objects simply to see what happens
(e.g. signs, buildings, landscape, and NPCs). In contrast, purposeful object interaction is when players seek out,
view, select, and interact with objects in a clear and strategic manner to accomplish some goal. They click on
specific objects in a virtual  world  that need  to be   collected  to advance     the game    or that are awarded as
reinforcement for a successful quest completion.
         In addition to examining the kinds of interactions a player has with given, data for assessment can be
gleaned by examining the types of objects with which the player interacts in completing an assessment quest.
There are  several  object types, each  of  which   provides   a   different type  of  data to  be analyzed:  realistic,
enhanced, and media objects. In addition to the different object types, there are a number of in-world object
classes with which players can interact, and through which assessment data of varying kinds can be gathered. In
examining player use of these different object classes, researchers can investigate the manner in which players
interact with the objects, the choice of objects used for specific tasks, the selection and assembly of objects into
a limited inventory of useable tools, and the de-selection or discarding choices of objects.

Communication Activity
A third evidence channel supported by MMOGs is Communication Activity. MMOGs generally support three
classes of communication: text-based instant messaging, voice-based communication, and non-verbal signaling
A!+%,"1!++$#"4$B,.&('6C;"D1),%%"!++"1+!%%$%",3"1,BB:(&1!.&,(@"8+!7$)%"1!("&(.$)!1."0&./",./$) players (and with
NPCs) for social and/or quest-related purposes. Quest-related communication consists primarily of pre-quest
planning strategies for upcoming quests, mid-quest communication used to share information about the quest
and conduct ongoing evaluation of the current status/effectiveness of team members---a kind of formative peer-
based evaluation system---, and post-quest summative peer evaluations. In post-quest communication, players
review successful or failed quest strategies and plan changes for future quests to increase the odds of group
success.

Dyadic and Triadic Channel Combinations
When players explore MMOGs, their activities and interactions are virtually never completed in the neatly
delineated fashion we outline above. Rather, players perform actions that produce evidence in dyadic and triadic
combinations from which useful assessment data can be derived.

Conclusion
With  careful design, MMOGs       can support   activities   that provide    data useful for   real-time and post-hoc
assessment of individual and group learning over time. These data have no inherent value for assessment by
themselves. It is only through careful design of the virtual worlds, in-world objects, tasks, and quests that the
data take on meaning for assessment. As we progress in our own research, we are working to refine the initial
ideas presented here, and seek to answer the many questions raised by this discussion.
