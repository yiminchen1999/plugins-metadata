           A bstract: Preparing citizens to address the complex problems inherent in cities requires our
           changing society to embrace a new kind of education. One way to train people to think about
           complex problems is to identify and study how professionals who think in those ways develop
           their epistemic frame. In this paper, we examine one of the ways urban planners master and
           appropriate relevant expertise through an ethnographic study of an urban planning practicum.
           Specifically, we use a new method called epistemic network analysis to look at presentation
           feedback  sessions  during two  weeks    of  the practicum    to explore   emergent   relationships

           indicate that epistemic network analysis offers a technique for analyzing the kinds of situated
           understanding  that result from  sociocultural   learning and    for observing the  translation of
           pedagogy into practice in various types of learning environments.

Major issue(s) addressed
Measuring learning in a practicum environment can be challenging, and a growing body of research suggests
that a new method called epistemic network analysis (Shaffer et al., 2009) can inform our understanding of how
professionals-in-training  learn in   a practicum   environment.   According      to Donald  Schön  (1983;    1987), a
practicum environment is explicitly designed to forge the links between knowing and doing that are central to
the reflective practice of a profession. In a practicum, novices are initiated into a professional community of
practice and extend their knowledge through tackling complex problems.
           John  Friedmann  (1973)  argues  that our   changing  society  requires   a new  kind of education   where
knowledge is extended and people are trained to think about and address the complex problems inherent in
cities. One   group  of professionals tasked with   addressing  several  of these  challenges is urban  planners, and
studying how professional urban planners learn in a practicum environment can help us better understand how
to train people to address complex problems.
           In this paper, we examine one of the ways urban planners develop expertise through an ethnographic
study   of  Urban and   Regional  Planning   (URPL)      912, a graduate    level practicum   at a large   Midwestern
university. The main goal of the study was to explore the learning processes experienced by the 20 graduate
students in the practicum. The students were guided in the production of a site plan for a developing area by a
planner with 34 years of planning experience. In the study, we used epistemic network analysis to examine the
presentation feedback sessions during weeks four and five and to explore emergent relationships between the

Potential significance of the work
The   results of  this  study  have   the potential  to  influence   the future   design  of  professional  practicum
environments as well as the broader landscape of education.

Theory
A major goal for educators is creating instructional contexts in which skills are both mastered and appropriated
(Herrenkohl & Wertsch, 1999). Mastery and appropriation, according to Wertsch and Polman (2001), are part of
mediated action9human action that is fundamentally characterized by a tension between active agents and the
cultural tools they use to carry out action. Wertsch and Polman (2001) define mediated action as forms of action
such    as speaking, reasoning,  and    calculating that inherently  involve    agents actively  using cultural  tools.
Herrenkohl and Wertsch (1999) stress that mastery of a cultural tool involves having the skill to use a cultural

knowledge.    In contrast, appropriation  focuses   on  an  (0"%#+,& #"%2"%)8& #6& 3,"& (& )3.#3*(.& #66.;& $'/)'& )(%& !"&
distinct from the level of mastery involved. Using Bakhtin (1981), Herrenkohl and Wertsch (1999) claim that

           High levels of mastery are frequently associated with appropriation; however, some forms of mediated
action are characterized by mastery but not appropriation of a cultural tool. Bakhtin argues that cultural tools are
often not easily and smoothly appropriated, and that an agent may use a cultural tool but with a feeling of
resistance or even outright rejection. When such resistance grows sufficiently strong, the agent may refuse to

         Herrenkohl and Wertsch (1999) believe that one of the most effective ways to foster the appropriation,
and not just the mastery of cultural tools is to coordinate these cultural tools with sociocognitive roles. They
claim that sociocognitive roles can be understood in terms of rights and responsibilities, where people have
opportunities to exercise their rights as a way of being responsible to their community. Herrenkohl and Wertsch
(1999) offer the example wherein a building inspector exercises her right to stop construction on a building
because the contractor is suspected of using sub-par materials. In this example, the inspector is exercising a right
in the context of her responsibility to protect public safety. Or, put simply, she is performing her job.

students  will practice skills  important   to  the  sociocognitive   role  and  begin to master   and appropriate     them.
Unfortunately   for educators   hoping  to    introduce  sociocognitive    roles into  their classrooms,   Herrenkohl   and
Wertsch do not outline a specific process for creating the sociocognitive roles or offer suggestions about the
types of skills that could be mastered or appropriated through students assuming roles.
         Schön (1983; 1987) argues that, in most professions, people begin to master and appropriate skills in
professional practicum experiences. In a professional practicum, novices engage in simulations of professional
work. Their work is guided by repeatedly taking action and explicitly reflecting on that action with peers and
mentors, what Schön refers to as reflection-on-action. The process of explicit reflection-on-action allows one to
look  back on  a completed    task  or  process   to consider    the implications  and  consequences   of  actions.  Schön
(1983; 1987)   argues  that the goal    of the  professional   practicum   is to bind  action  and reflection   together  to
produce professional expertise particular to each profession.
         Extending Schön, Shaffer (2004a; 2004b; 2006) argues that a professional practicum is a key step to
developing the epistemic frame9or the ways of knowing, of deciding what is worth knowing, and of adding to
the collective body of knowledge and understanding9of a particular community of practice. In a practicum
environment,   experienced  mentors     explicitly   reflect-on-action  as  a way  to  model   the epistemic    frame  of a
profession. For novices, iterative cycles of action and explicit reflection-on-action with peers and mentors bind
together the elements of the epistemic frame9the skills, knowledge, values, identity, and epistemology9that
an  individual takes on  as a   member     of a community     of  practice. This  collection  of cultural  tools forms   the
epistemic frame of the community, which, once appropriated, can be used when an individual approaches a
situation from the point of view (or in the role) of a member of the community (Shaffer 2004a; 2004b; 2005;
2006).
         Thus, Schön (1983; 1987) and Shaffer (2006) have a model of learning in a professional practicum that
involves iterative cycles of action, explicit reflection-on-action, and the construction of a profession-specific

tools with sociocognitive   roles   can lead   to both   mastery  and  appropriation.   Specifically, Schön     and Shaffer
move beyond a conversation about rights and responsibilities and into a discussion about designing professional

resistance plays in the mastery and appropriation of an epistemic frame.
         While it is possible, and often quite important, to analyze how well students and others have mastered a
cultural tool, such  analyses   can be  quite   limited  in  that they do   not  consider all of the  complexities   in  the
relationship between agents and the cultural tools they use (Wertsch, 1998). Thus, measuring appropriation in a
practicum setting requires analysis of the process over time to see if there are instances of resistance that are
inhibiting the  appropriation   of  the epistemic    frame.   One    way to   analyze  those  components     is through   an
epistemography, an analysis of the structure of a professional practicum through the lens of epistemic frames
where  one  can  examine    the kinds   of action    and reflection-on-action    that develop  the epistemic    frame  of a
profession (Shaffer, 2005; Svarovsky, 2006; Hatfield, 2008). An epistemography allows one to see learning
principles at  work  and   recognize    some    features  of  the practicum   as   being  more   essential than   others  in
developing  the  professional   epistemic   frame.   However,     as Wertsch   (1998)  noted,  the relationships    between
agents and their use of cultural tools are complex, and traditional statistical methods do not account for the
complexities.
         The kinds of professional understanding that a practicum develops are complex because they are not
merely a collection of disconnected skills and knowledge. Rather, the power of an epistemic frame is in the
connections   among  its parts, a   network    which   consists   of relationships among     conceptual, practical,  moral,
personal,  and epistemological   parts  (Shaffer    et al., 2009).   Thus,  analytical methods   such  as  social   network
analysis provide a robust set of tools for representing networks of relationships, including complex and dynamic
relationships of the kind that characterize epistemic frames (Shaffer et al., 2009). In social networks, individuals
are considered   nodes  in  the network    and  relationships    between   individuals are   represented  as arcs   or links
between nodes (Haythornthwaite, 1996). For example, a social network analysis of an urban planning practicum

                                                       82   ·  © ISLS

might examine the relationships among students and the teacher throughout class meetings. Within each class
session, different configurations might emerge as old friends connected, new friendships emerged, and different
team projects occurred. The amount of time individuals spend with each other could be taken as a proxy for the
strength of their relationship by analyzing the different connections among and between nodes and links. That
type of analysis would provide a quantifiable way of comparing social relationships across time and a means for
better understanding the informal information flows that supplement the formal practicum curriculum.
        However,   as    Shaffer  (2009)  argues,  social   network   analysis was  developed    to provide    insight  into
relationships among   and   between    individuals    and  groups,   rather than  relationships  within   the  conceptual,
practical, moral, and epistemological world of an individual. Therefore, building on social network analysis,
Shaffer (2009)    has developed     epistemic   network     analysis, a    computational  modeling    technique     for the
development of epistemic frames.
        Epistemic network analysis is based on two key concepts: (1) that thinking can be characterized by the
application of an epistemic frame composed of the linkages between professional skills, knowledge, identity,
values, and epistemology; and (2) that the development of professional thinking can be quantified, analyzed,
and visualized  with  a  dynamic    network    model    of   the developing    epistemic frame   (Shaffer   et al.,  2009).
Epistemic network analysis has been used to trace frame development in elementary and middle school students
during epistemic games based on engineering and urban planning (Nulty & Shaffer, 2008; Nash & Shaffer,
2008). A preliminary re-analysis of qualitative data collected on a science journalism practicum suggests that
epistemic  network analysis    will be a   useful tool  for  analyzing  epistemic   frame   development   in  professional
practica (Hatfield, 2008).
        This study extends the ideas of Wertsch, Schön, and Shaffer by examining the relationships between
appropriation, resistance, reflection-on-action, and epistemic frames in a professional planning practicum. The
aim of this study9the epistemography of URPL 9129is to uncover the learning process within a graduate
urban planning  practicum.     In particular, we  investigate    how  one   teacher communicated      his urban   planning

tracking how specific features and events in the practicum led to significant changes in frame development. We
argue that epistemic network analysis can provide a computational model of the extent to which participants
appropriated  the ways   of  knowing,    being,   talking,  and  acting that   characterize a  particular  community      of
practice. Finally, we discuss how the results of this study may contribute to the design of reflective learning
environments and experiences that promote the development of the next generation of urban citizens.

Methods
        Urban and Regional Planning (URPL) 912 was a three credit course that met once a week for 14 weeks
for approximately three hours. We chose to study URPL 912 because the course gives graduate students an
opportunity to work in a practicum setting and is a prerequisite to entering the professional field of planning.
The teacher was a professional planner with 34 years of planning experience across the United States.
        In the  course,   20   graduate  students  from    the   URPL   masters  program    prepared   a  site plan   for a
developing area of approximately 3,000 acres on the northeast edge of Madison, Wisconsin. In the syllabus, the

professional planner guest speaker for the first hour and team work time for the remaining two hours.
        Classroom     data  were    collected  in  digital   audio  recordings   and   supplemented    with    field notes.
Recordings were transcribed to provide a detailed record of interactions, and field notes were used to capture
meaningful non-verbal    aspects   of the  context and    to supplement    the transcripts. No  information    on  specific
career plans was collected; however, several students mentioned plans to pursue planning in city departments,
non-profit groups, and state agencies. No other demographic information was collected about the students.
        The   data were    segmented    into  interactive    units  which   were defined    as strips of  activity   with a
consistent interactional structure and topical focus. For example, if the class started discussing the capacity of a
proposed wastewater treatment plant and then switched to discussing the location of bike and pedestrian paths,
the switch in discourse topic would indicate two separate interactive units. If an interactive unit represented
more  than one  category,   it was  coded   for   all applicable    codes. Within   each interactive  unit,  the studen#,+&

practicum. To capture interactions between the expert teacher and the novice students, we decided to focus on
the communication between the teacher and the students during presentation feedback sessions. Presentation
feedback  sessions were    occasions   for the  teacher   and   the students to  offer feedback   on  information    teams
collected and for the teacher to explicitly reflect-on-action. Those sessions occurred in four classes throughout

the semester: weeks 4, 5, 11, and 13. We chose to analyze data from the presentation feedback in weeks four
and five because the feedback given during those weeks focused on the information needed to create successful
site plans whereas the feedback given in weeks 11 and 13 was more focused on the logistics of preparing for the
final presentations. The specific activities in   weeks   four and  five are  outlined   in more    detail in   the results

         The result   of the coded  segments  was   a  database    of interactive units showing   the  presence    of the
#"()'"*+,& )6??"%#,;& *",/,#(%)";& *"7.")#/6%-on-action, and epistemic frame elements. The relationships among
these different components were then analyzed using epistemic network analysis to identify salient themes.
         Epistemic network analysis adapts the framework of social network analysis for use with cognitive,
rather than social,  elements (Hatfield, 2008;   Shaffer   et al., 2009).   As discussed   in the background     section,
Shaffer  (2009)   has developed    epistemic  network     analysis,   a computational    modeling    technique   for  the
development    of epistemic  frames. For details   on  the  computations    involved  in   epistemic network    analysis,
please see Shaffer (2009).
         Once  an   epistemic frame  is represented    as a   series of cumulative   adjacency  matrices    showing   the
strength of association   between   each pair   of frame    elements    for a given  participant  in   the data  set, the
characteristics of the network can be quantified using concepts from social network analysis, such as network
density and centrality of individual nodes (Shaffer et al., 2009). The overall structure of an epistemic frame can
then be quantified by computing the relative centrality of each node: the square root of the sum of squares of its
associations with its neighbors expressed as a percentage of the weight of the heaviest node in the network.
         For this study, the relative centrality of each frame element and sub-element at the final time slice of

in centrality to the epistemic network graph.
         The frame similarity index (FSI) is an extension of epistemic network analysis. In this study, the FSI

skills, knowledge, values, and epistemology as a whole, the average of the frame sub-elements (e.g. E/SD and
E/UF) was computed, and the results were graphed as cumulative frame elements (e.g. epistemology instead of
E/SD and E/UF).
         The FSI affords us the ability to use qualitative data to compare the development of complex thinking
quantitatively. The FSI can be visualized using a radar plot where the optimal frame is represented as the origin
and the  developing   frame   is shown   as something.    This   type   of  representation allows  us  to  visualize  the

         At the beginning of the semester, students in URPL 912 worked in teams to gather information about
the redevelopment site. During the first class session, they learned that the City of Madison had been working
on a plan for the site for three years, and #'"&,#32"%#,&$"*"&"1-")#"2&#6&<*"(2&#'"&.(%2,)(-">&(%2&"1-(%2&3-6%&

teacher, guest speakers from the City of Madison planning department, out of class site visits and meetings with
city officials, and targeted internet research. The teams were expected to present their initial findings during
week four and their more specific findings during week five.
         While presenting and giving feedback during week four, the students referred to the approach the City
of Madison was using for the redevelopment site. When the teacher suggested alternative approaches that were

Specifically, the teacher suggested   that taking  time   to gather information  early in the  process   would have
positive implications for the final site plan. To address their anxieties, he encouragingly reflected on the work
the students completed in week four, told them he was expecting to be pleased in week five, and assured them

      closer to zero, their frame begins to look more like the frame the teacher modeled in week four.
       By separating the epistemic frame elements into sub-elements, a more complete picture emerged about
which specific sub-"."?"%#,& !")(?"& ?6*"& 6*& .",,& )"%#*(.& #6& #'"& ,#32"%#,+& "-/,#"?/)& 7*(?"& 7*6? week four to
week five (Table 2). As discussed above, for the teacher, V/PI, S/QA, S/Land, K/AI, and E/UF were the most
central sub-elements in his epistemic frame in week four while the most central sub-"."?"%#,&/%&#'"&,#32"%#,+&

V/PI, E/SD, and K/P, the students exhibited a new configuration of their epistemic frame which looked more

order of centrality of frame elements also changed from week four to week five.

which the node is or is not part of the dense central core of the network. Thus, though some of the sub-elements

will likely strengthen over time.

an explicit reflection on the different frames held by the teacher and the students and provided a map of the
professional vision of the planning practice. However, it seems unlikely that his lecture immediately helped the
students understand the epistemic frame of planners in a new light and enabled them to put their new knowledge
into practice in their presentation feedback. Therefore, the students must have started appropriating aspects of

       Thus, these results also suggest that the kind of reflective mentoring that Schön and Shaffer describe in
professional practicum settings accomplishes the task of helping students appropriate a new frame in the face of
resistance. Specifically, the results of  this study  indicate   that  identifying practicum  activities that evoke
evidence about certain aspects of an epistemic frame will provide valuable information for designing effective
practicum   environments  and learning in general. For    example,  practitioners  thinking about ways   to enhance
their practice might consider including iterative cycles of action and reflection-on-action which may lead to
appropriation and mastery.

         This  study  demonstrates that epistemic  network      analysis  can be   a productive  way of   tracking how
specific interactions  within  learning environments      lead  to significant   changes   in  cognitive  development.
Building  on  initial work (Hatfield, 2008;   Shaffer et   al.,  2009),  this study   adds  frame  similarity index  to

useful for group   comparisons  and experimental   studies    of  interventions. In  other  words, epistemic  network
analysis provides a computational model of the process and extent to which participants appropriated the ways
of knowing, being, talking, and acting that characterize a particular community of practice. Thus, epistemic
network   analysis offers  a  technique  for analyzing    the   kinds   of situated   understanding  that result   from
sociocultural learning.
