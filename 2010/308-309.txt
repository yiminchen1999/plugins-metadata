       A bst r act : The    Activity Model of Inquiry    (Harwood,     2004)   is a theoretically-grounded    and
       empirically-derived     model   of scientific  inquiry.    This research   examines  how    undergraduate
      !"#$%&"!'()*%+! of scientific inquiry shift after introduction of the Activity Model of Inquiry in a
       general chemistry course.       Students are asked to respond to essay prompts and a pre- and post-
       questionnaire.    Preliminary findings show shifts from a naïve view to a more informed view of
       nature of scientific inquiry for some students.

particular image of science and how scientists conduct science that does not reflect the enterprise accurately, often
because they do not understand the processes of sciences and the creation of scientific knowledge, which compose

scientific method (TSM) as a thinking frame to teach the process of science.      However, there is a lot of
dissatisfaction with the TSM model, for it includes an overall step-by-step linear view of the scientific process and
lacks any theoretical, cultural, or social aspect to the creation of scientific knowledge. This is inaccurate both
because of the non-linear aspect of many scientific inquiries and the fact that all knowledge should be thought of as
a means for meeting human needs.      Omitting the   latter aspect, it has been argued, is both false and less likely to
engage learners (Rudolph, 2005).
      H*55*30(I31+66$'!((2004) Activity Model of Inquiry is a recent,
data-based model that may have the instructional potential as a thinking
frame for teaching nature of science aspects. It was developed from
interviews with fifty two faculty members across nine disciplines at a
research university (Harwood, Reiff, & Phillipson, 2002).     Within the
model, there are ten activities in a web-like structure (Figure 1).   There is
no unique pathway for inquiry; students chose what to do next based on
what they need. Questions are in the middle suggesting them as the
central feature of inquiry. Questions include general and divergent
questions that help frame the inquiry. In addition, the Activity Model of
Inquiry has significant potential in discussing the aspects of NOS.
       The research question for this study is: what happens with the
Activity Model of Inquiry when using it as an instructional tool?
                                                                                                      !

This research study uses an interpretive qualitative framework and                      Harwood Activity Model
includes a design component.   Thirteen students provided consent within
a first semester general chemistry course at an urban community college where the author was the instructor.
Assignments relevant to NOS were a standardized questionnaire given at the beginning and end of the semester and
four course-related writing assignments given throughout the semester. Assignments were chosen using a
constructivist perspective. That is, knowledge is constructed     from previous experiences (Bransford,  2000, p. 11).
All students completed the Views of Nature of Science questionnaire Form-C (Lederman, Abd-El-Khalick, Bell, &

understanding around the myth of the scientific method, which is the focus of this paper.      The first writing
assignment asked students to describe how, in their view, scientific knowledge is created and what approach
scientists take to create it. The second and third writing assignments asked the students to interact with the Activity
Model of  Inquiry. Students    were to analyze a scientific news article and their own laboratory work using the Activity
Model of  Inquiry. The fourth writing assignment prompted       students to reflect on their understanding of science and
how, if at all, their view had changed from the beginning of the semester.    Instructor lesson plans and reflections
were collected to inform further implementations.
         Analysis is being conducted using an interpretive framework.      The pre- and post-questionnaire responses
will be coded using Lederman, et al. (2002) coding scheme.       Follow-up   interviews were conducted to validate the

began the semester thinking    all science follows the TSM.   Both of their illustrations of the process of scientific
inquiry depicted a linear process.  However, toward the end of the semester the students began to incorporate
Activity Model of Inquiry components in their responses, particularly the Communicating With Others component.
Some students also developed more informed views regarding the different approaches taken to solve a scientific
problem and that there is freedom within this process.     One student showed a significant change in her view of the
myth of a scientific method.    Prior to introduction of the Activity Model of Inquiry, this student listed steps of the
TSM to describe scientific investigations.  However, at the end of the    semester she stated, :&6(!%"(61$%1(6-(

student illustrates a case where no changes were observed.      For both the pre- and post-questionnaire, she responded
that experiments are based off   of the TSM and listed the steps of the TSM.   These results   suggest that the Activity
Model of Inquiry can support shifts but also reminds us that major changes in deeply helps beliefs are difficult to
change in a short one-semester experience.
