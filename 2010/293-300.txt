         In this study we build on the closely related constructs of teacher attention and responsiveness to
         explore how one fifth-grade teacher facilitates scientific inquiry. We illustrate the dual use of
         responsiveness and framing through the case study of Mrs. Charles, who skillfully elicits and
         builds on students' ideas in her science classroom.      In  our analysis,  we  found  that ranking   the
         extent of this teacher's responsiveness was inadequate for describing the nature of her teaching and
         for uncovering ways in which this teacher might progress. Analyzing Mrs. Charles's practice in
         terms of her framing of the situation, however, began to reveal patterns and nuances in the nature
         of her responsiveness. We argue that it is through the overlay of her epistemological framing onto
         an analysis of her responsiveness that we get a fuller picture of Mrs. Charles's practice:     inviting
         and valuing students' contributions while encouraging exploration of certain ideas over others.

Introduction
Reform in science education calls for active student engagement in scientific inquiry (NRC, 1996), where children
propose,  evaluate, investigate, and  synthesize  ideas    to  develop    causal explanations    of  phenomena     (Duschl
Schweingruber & Shouse, 2007). While research has documented that children have abundant nascent resources for
reasoning about and making sense of the world around them (diSessa, 1993; Metz, 1995; Tytler & Peterson, 2004),
transforming these abilities into expertise in scientific inquiry still requires substantial work, both for the learner and
for the teacher. Students  must  engage extensively   and   productively    in practices like  reasoning mechanistically
(Russ, Scherr, Hammer & Mikeska, 2008), modeling (Schwarz, Reiser, Davis, Kenyon, Acher, Fortus, Shwartz, Hug

and  reasoning  are to serve as  the building  blocks for   both  the process   of  scientific inquiry  and  the scientific
understandings that constitute the products of inquiry, instruction cannot be scripted or prepackaged (Duschl et al.,

traditional science classroom.   Listening and attending   to   the   sense students are  making,    rather than   focusing
primarily   on how  their responses  align  with scientific    canon,  requires  not only  a   shift in how    the  teacher
conceptualizes her role in the classroom (Empson and Jacobs, 2008), but contrasts with the social and institutional
objectives to which teachers are held accountable (Levin, 2008). Additionally, children frequently have difficulty

intentional focus on why a teacher might be attending to certain ideas over others. Understanding why a teacher
notices or responds to specific ideas or in specific ways can inform efforts to promote teacher change.

inquiry can be described in terms of the relationship between her responsiveness and framing, and illustrate this with
a case study of one fifth-grade teacher embarking on pedagogical change.

Framing of the Classroom Activity
Teachers have a tacit understanding of what it means for their students to Sdo scienceT that shapes what it is they
attempt to enact in their classrooms. A pe2*0(>*"'(*?+2"70"71+"G=+*7-0(!"SWhat is it that's going on here?T is what we
refer to as his or her framing of the situation (Goffman, 1986; Hammer, Elby, Scherr & Redish, 2005; Tannen,

                                                    293        ISLS

1993). With respect to elementary science, there are many possibilities for how a teacher might answer this question.
For +R'3AC+!"Sdoing scienceT in the classroom may involve reading the textbook, following prescribed experiments,
or engaging in debates about natural phenomena. Consistent with Hammer, Russ, Mikeska, and Scherr's (2008)
definition of scientific inquiry, we hope teachers will come to see classroom science as the pursuit of plausible,
mechanistic accounts of natural phenomena.
          The theoretical construct of framing, as we use it here, is distinct from but related to a more colloquial use
of SframingT as one>s intentional portrayal of a situation to others. When we describe how a teacher frames the
classroom activity, we are referring to her own perception of the situation rather than to how she deliberately
represents a task for her students. For us, the power of framing lies in its ability to describe a person's implicit
understanding of the nature of the broader situation she finds herself in. In this sense, we consider framing at a
comparatively large grain size. There are multiple aspects to any given framing:     social interactions, tool use, and
B0)D"C'(.='.+!"'*"?+CC"'*"?1'7"-7"3+'(*"70"S,(0?T"*03+71ing in science, that is, the epistemological nature of the
scientific endeavor. This component of framing differs from epistemological beliefs in that framing accounts for
what the teacher does in the classroom, that is, her actions and the roles she takes on while teaching science. This
does not always coincide with her explicitly stated, decontextualized views about teaching and the nature of science
(Abd-El-Khalick, Bell & Lederman, 1998; Lederman, 1999).
          In cases where framing has been used to describe how students reason about science, there is evidence to
suggest that their framing constrains both the types of knowledge they employ and how they use that knowledge
(Hammer, et al., 2005; Louca, Elby, Hammer & Kagey, 2004). We take this as an indication t1'7"'"7+'/1+2>s framing
could describe the lens through which she attends to student thinking. This may elucidate how and why she is
responsive to certain ideas over others, and how she uses these ideas in her response.

Responsiveness to Student Thinking
Previous work in mathematics education suggests that how a teacher listens can transform how children talk and,
ultimately, influence what they learn (Jacobs, Lamb, Philipp, & Schappelle, 2009; Sherin & van Es, 2009). When
studying teachers participating in video-based professional development, researchers found that what teachers attend
to  ?1'7"71+D" (07-/+" 'B0=7"71+" 3'71+3'7-/'C")+7'-C*"0<"71+"/1-C)>*"-)+'    is intertwined with how they respond to
students (Empson & Jacobs, 2008; Jacobs, et al., 2009). Classroom studies of teacher noticing use moment-by-
moment statements of students and teachers as the units of analysis (Pierson, 2008; Sherin & van Es, 2009). For
example, Sherin and van Es (2009) focused on instances when student ideas were presented in class and then
determined whether or not teachers noticed these ideas. Pierson (2008) quantified patterns in teachers> follow-up

the classroom (p.25). Pierson found a significant correlation between student learning and the highest level of
teacher responsiveness that she articulates (High II). In defining High II responsiveness, Pierson identifies four types
of teacher follow-up moves:        an invitation to further explain the idea, offering a contradiction or counterclaim
related to the idea, an invitation for other students to make sense of the idea (agree/disagree, etc.), or uptake of the

          When accounting for the actions of an experienced teacher implementing a module in scientific inquiry, we
found that utterances and follow-up questions provided too small of an analytic grain size to adequately make sense

reasons described in the introduction. We found, however, that a few teachers did in fact attend to students> ideas in
ways that existing measures of responsiveness would categorize as high. For this paper, we focus on one of the latter
teachers, Mrs. Charles (pseudonym), and describe how we identified what might constitute progress for her in
promoting scientific inquiry in her classroom.
       The data sources for this study include video recordings of Mrs. Charles's implementation of a 15-hour
module. On the first day of the module, the supporting curricular materials suggest that teachers pose the following
question to their students:

       Suppose     that one night   it rains. When you   arrive  at school you notice that      there are puddles of
       rainwater in the parking lot.     But when you go home you notice that the puddles are gone. What
       happened to the rainwater?

Rather than follow a scripted curriculum, teachers were encouraged to pursue ideas and questions which
students brought up during the discussion of this first question. Additional data included classroom field
notes taken by the second author, and video and/or field notes from debriefing sessions with the second
author aft+2"+'/1")'D>*"-(*72=/7-0(:
       Analysis proceeded in phases. Initially both authors independently viewed all of the classroom video,

responsiveness in a broad sense to mean noticing and responding to a student>s idea either by rephrasing the idea,
probing for further clarification, or shifting the direction of the discussion in a way that addresses the idea (Levin,
Hammer, & Coffey, 2009). Finding that Mrs. Charles was generally responsive to students> ideas, each author then
identified and transcribed several episodes representing the various types of activities in the classroom (small group
discussion, small group experimentation, whole class discussion). Analytic memos summarizing the student ideas
and  interpreting U2*:" H1'2C+*>s   responses   within these     episodes were     compared   by the two   authors  to        try to
understand  the   nature of  U2*:" H1'2C+*>s   responsiveness.   By  means      of the cyclical, interpretive   analysis       cycle
(Clement,   2000)  (2),  we   continued   to   analyze video     episodes     and  modify   our  account  of  Mrs.  Charles's
responsiveness until we found a pattern that fit the data and presented a reasonable, coherent account of her actions.
We argue below that it was only by applying the construct of framing to our analysis of Mrs. Charles's actions that
we were able to understand why she consistently responded in particular ways to students> ideas. The coupled use of
these constructsVresponsiveness and framingVis the main focus of this preliminary work, and we save for future
analysis the endeavor of quantifying the frequency with which Mrs. Charles frames science in any given way.

Findings
Mrs. Charles took very quickly to     the practice of giving students space to express their ideas.          From the initial
opening question about a puddle, Mrs. Charles facilitated discussions and encouraged experimentation based on the
questions students posed about various topics related to evaporation. For example, after listing on the board several

of inquiry for experimentation. The following segment of transcript, taken from a student-initiated class debate,
exemplifies how Mrs. Charles provides space for students to describe their own reasoning and critique others> ideas.

                             that would affect it, because you're talking about a puddle, which is not, like

          M rs. C harles:    Talk to this table. They were the ones who put it on. I have nothing to do with it.

                  Cody:      Well, um. Well, the heat comes down on the parking lot, 'cause the parking lot is
                             really big, then   the heat won't   go to  that    one little water spot. It  will go to
                             everywhere, and it won't be hot in that water spot. If it's smaller, it will focus in
                             on that, on a littler spot, and it'll be hotter.

          M rs. C harles:    Andrea, did you want to add something to it?
                A nd r ea:   It actually does matter, because, um, if the parking lot's bigger, the sun would go
                             everywhere in the parking lot, and it wouldn't be as hot in that one area where the

                           puddle is. And if it's smaller, it would be hotter because it's a smaller area and
                           more heat would be able to go in there, in that one area.
          M rs. C harles:  Brian, you're shaking your head. What's going on?
                B r ian:   Wouldn't the sun go to every single place?
                Susan:     Yeah, but that's what I was doing.
                Cody:      Yeah, but it wouldn't be as hot, 'cause it has to cover all those places.

        This episode is representative of U2*:"H1'2C+*>s interactions throughout the module in that she facilitates
discussions between students, allowing their reasoning to develop in response to critiques from classmates rather
than looking to an authority figure for approval or disapproval. Mrs. Charles promoted experimentationVnot the
assertion of a teacher or textVas the ultimate authority o("S?1'7"?02,+)T! and often led student discussions toward
empirical  investigation. During    the module,   Mrs. Charles   guided   her class in four cycles  of exploration,  each
consisting of students (a) generating a variety of questions while discussing some aspect of the puddle, (b) selecting
which questions to pursue, (c) designing and implementing experiments to test those ideas, (d) reporting outcomes,
and (e) finding new questions and topics of investigation. Each cycle lasted approximately 2-4 hours spread over
one to two class periods, and students spent a considerable portion of this time engaged in experimenting. This
overall organization of the module emerged from Mrs. Charles rather than from professional development or project
directives and was driven more by students> ideas than most other teachers> module implementations were during
this first year of the project.
        Analyzing U2*:"    H1'2C+*>*    classes, we  find  evidence   of  her responsiveness  to student   thinking. She
consistently responds to students by restating the idea or asking others what they think of the idea without Staking
overT the students> thinking. This, according to the literature, is evidence of attention to students> ideas (Empson &
Jacobs, 2009; Pierson, 2008; Sherin & van Es, 2009). A closer analysis of extended episodes, however, revealed a
consistency underlying U2*:"H1'2C+*>s responsiveness, a consistency arising from what we suspect to be a relatively
stable framing of what science class is all about.

Framing Influencing Responsiveness
Mrs. Charles's frequent attention to 0(+"*A+/-<-/"'*A+/7"0<"*7=)+(7*> ideas, the potential testability of an idea, is what
caused us to question the sufficiency of analyzing Mrs. Charles through the lens of her responsiveness alone. This
section provides two extended examples of Mrs. Charles being responsive to her students in a way that promotes
science as a fundamentally      empirical endeavor.  These    episodes,  although representative of  the typical teacher-
student interactions in her classroom, were chosen because they effectively portray the nuances of what aspects of
student thinking Mrs. Charles notices and responds to, and to what ends she uses these ideas.

Example 1
While interacting with small groups, Mrs. Charles frequently steers students to consider further experimentation.
Just prior to the following episode, Mrs. Charles had asked the whole class to draw what they saw happening to the
puddle during their experiments on the previous day. While visiting a small group, she elicits one student>s thinking,
challenges the epistemological basis of his claim, and then poses a question that both answers that epistemological
challenge and suggests a course of action for the students:

          M rs. C harles:  Okay, so what is it you have there [on your drawing]?
                 M att:    Okay. So the heat goes, like, down into the water. And then the water turns into its
                           gashus    or gas-e-ous  [laughs]--its-its-its gas  form--which is called  water vapor.
                           And so, like, this is what's happening.
          M rs. C harles:  How do you know that it's the heat from the sun that's causing it, and not the heat
                           from the ground?
                 M att:    Well, it could be the heat from the ground, but the ground got heated up from the
                           sun. So it's originally from-from heat, right?
          M rs. C harles:  [to boy sitting next to Matt] So wha'd'ya think? Do you agree with him?
                 M att:    'Cause the ground got heat from the sun, and the sun. So it's like both.
          M rs. C harles:  How would you test that to prove it?

Mrs. Charles displays responsiveness throughout this interaction by eliciting ideas, engaging with the specifics of a
student>s idea, challenging the student>s thinking without promoting her own reasoning as a substitute, and inviting

                                                       296     ISLS

others to make sense of that student>s idea. Upon closer inspection, we find that U2*:" H1'2C+*>s responsiveness is
focused primarily on the aspects of Matt>s idea that lend themselves to empirical investigation.
        Matt>s response to U2*:"H1'2C+*>s initial elicitation describes a causal chain of events that begins to account
for what happens  to the puddle:  heat from the sun  goes   down   to the water, which then causes the   water to change
into its gas form. Mrs. Charles follows up with a responsive, substantive probe (S90?")0"D0=",(0?"Y"ZT) about one
*A+/-<-/"'*A+/7"0<"U'77>s reasoning    that the 1+'7"'<<+/7-(."71+"?'7+2"/03+*"S)0?(T from the sun. U2*:"H1'2C+*>s
question could be a way of asking Matt to expound on his mechanistic understanding, and perhaps she has reason to
believe that the nature of the heat source is vital to his budding model. Her subsequent follow-ups, however, do not
continue to press for explanation. Rather, her final comment (SHow would you test that to prove it?T) is a clear
invitation to design an experiment.
        The aspect of Matt>s reasoning that Mrs. Charles chooses to focus on        where the source of the heat comes
from  is perhaps the most practical component of Matt>s explanation to investigate empirically. Identifying the
source of the heat translates nicely, although not simply, into experimental treatments, where the SgroundT surface
temperature is controlled, and where a fixed amount of light can reach the puddle. However, a direct empirical
investigation of the  process   Matt alludes to,  of how    Sthe water   turns into its  ... gas formT, is not  nearly as
straightforward. In this sense, U2*:"H1'2C+*>s highlighting of Sheat goes, like, down into the waterT rather than Sthe
water turns into its ... gas formT is consistent with a framing of scientific inquiry as fundamentally about developing
questions and conducting experiments to answer those questions.

Example 2
This second   example is  taken from a group  of  students in  the midst  of a controversy:   one  student is adamant  the
S*7=<<T they observed rising off their puddle was heat, and the others insist that it was water vapor. As before, Mrs.
Charles elicits students> ideas and follows up on the content of those ideas, and she probes with an epistemological

                 Susan:    She [Ella] thinks it's water.
                   E lla:  She [Susan] thinks it's not water vapor. And then, we think that it is water vapor,
                           but then she's gonna raise her hand, say her opinion and stuff-
        M rs. C harles:    [to Susan] Why do you think it's not water vapor?
                 Susan:    Because-
        M rs. C harles:    What do you think it is?
                 Susan:    Um, I think it's heat because the blacktop is, like, really, like, hot?
        M rs. C harles:    Mmm hmm
                 Susan:    And if you put a puddle on it, it's, like, gonna, like, react? to it?
        M rs. C harles:    Okay.
                 Susan:    And so, I think what's coming up is, like, heat.
        M rs. C harles:    How do you know that if you put a puddle on something hot it's gonna react to it?

Again, Mrs. Charles displays responsiveness to student thinking in that she elicits student ideas, acknowledges ideas,
highlights specific elements of an idea, and challenges the student to support her claim. Even when Ella is reflecting
on the nature '()"2'3-<-/'7-0(*"0<"71+".20=A>s disagreement, Mrs. Charles chooses to be responsive to the scientific

of her framing of science can elucidate what she is responsive to and how she is responsive. In the case of Mrs.
Charles, this analysis finds her responsiveness taking the form of guiding students towards experimentation as a way
to SproveT their thinking. The component 0<"U2*:"H1'2C+*>*" <2'3-(."71'7"-s most relevant here has to do with her
stance on how students go about constructing scientific knowledge, which we will refer to as her epistemological
framing (Hammer, et al., 2005). Along with the consistent nature of her responsiveness to ideas that are testable,
additional sources of data (comments about her class during debriefing sessions and the iterative exploration cycles
during  the module)    provide further  evidence    to suggest    that Mrs.  Charles    frames    the  inquiry   module  as  an
opportunity to pose critical questions about phenomena and investigate them empirically.
         The   epistemological component    of Mrs.  Charles>s    framing   treats knowledge    as inherently    empirical: we
have ideas in science, but we have to test them to know if they are correct. This captures an important component of
the nature  of science:   that science  is accountable     to empirical   findings  (Abd-El-Khalick     &  Lederman,     2000;
McComas, 1998). Experimentation, however, is only one part of inquiry. Many teachers> conceptualizations of
inquiry involve setting up experiments and identifying the observable outcomes, but do not involve the development
of theories or models of natural phenomena (Chinn      & Malhotra, 2002; Windschitl, 2004).        Therefore,  teachers> ideas
of what science is may require subtle, but important changes.
         Although the students> ideas and questions provide the terrain for exploration in U2*:" H1'2C+*>s class, a
desirable and sophisticated inquiry practice, we found that her consistent epistemological framing of science inquiry
as primarily empirical investigation also resulted in less desirable aspects of classroom science. For example, Mrs.
H1'2C+*>*" endorsement   of pseudo    experiments,   such  as    one group   designing    a  diorama   inside  a condensation
chamber,  or   another  group  following online directions    to  create  a  cloud  in  a bottle.  Additionally,  because   the
students were encouraged to explore any questions they were interested in pursuing, this resulted in the divergence
of different groups of students into different lines of research. Divergent explorations did not ultimately feed into the
larger purpose  of constructing  an    explanatory  account    of  evaporation   and    related phenomena.     Therefore,   our
findings reveal  that  U2*:" H1'2C+*>s epistemological     framing   led her to  focus    on particular  aspects  of students>
ideas  the  testability or  potential  fruitfulness of  the   ideas    which  resulted    in iterative  cycles   of  questions,
experimentation, observation, new questions over the course of the 15-hour module. The construct of framing allows
us to make sense of why Mrs. Charles attended to particular aspects of students' ideas, as well as illuminates a
direction for progress for a highly responsive teacher that already views students Sas Phavers> of ideas and classroom
communities as groups that productively entertain these ideasT (Cohen, 2004, p.21).

Discussion
The teacher education literature suggests that really listening to and engaging in students' ideas is a characteristic or
skill that takes time for teachers to cultivate (Empson & Jacobs, 2008; Franke, Carpenter, Levi, & Fennema, 2001;
Pierson, 2008). In an informal interview with Mrs. Charles, she readily admitted that prior to participation in this
professional development project she did not enjoy teaching science, and she described her previous science class as

clearly responsive moves:   she provided space for students to articulate their ideas; she took up student thinking by
rephrasing, challenging and building on it; she probed for further clarification; and she shifted the direction of the
discussion in ways that addressed student ideas. Simply describing the extent to which Mrs. Charles was responsive,
however, does not offer a thorough account of Mrs. Charles's facilitation of scientific inquiry. A closer analysis of
her responsiveness revealed a pattern:   she tended to respond to ideas that lent themselves to empirical testing and
often guided students toward experimentation by challenging how they might "know", "prove", or "test" their ideas.
Framing helps make sense of the (='(/+*" -(" U2*:" H1'2C+*>*" 2+*A0(*-E+(+**" B+/'=*+"it can account for why Mrs.

into how    to address  her concern  and   also illuminates   a potential   path for teacher   change. While   Mrs.  Charles
skillfully helped students develop and investigate questions, her framing of science as empirical investigation may
have limited her ability to recognize opportunities for other components of scientific inquiry. An alternate framing
of scientific inquiry as theory construction and experimentation may result in Mrs. Charles modifying the ways in
which she is responsive. For example, with this expanded framing of inquiry we may see Mrs. Charles lead students
in synthesizing their observations in pursuit of a theoretical model of evaporation. While Mrs. Charles encouraged
each group to share out the results of their experiments, these findings were not woven back into a collective
explanat-0("<02"+E'A02'7-0("'()"71+"?'7+2"/D/C+:";(*7+')!"71+"*7=)+(7*>"+3A-2-/'C"<-()-(.*"?+2+"sufficient to suggest

         This study is taken from a larger project aimed at, in part, characterizing teacher progress in facilitating
scientific inquiry.  The construct  of teacher  learning  progressions      (Schwarz   et al., 2009; Thompson,  Braaten   &
Windschitl, 2009), can document how teachers fundamentally alter their view of what can and should take place in
the science classroom, and how to hear and develop the beginnings of science in children's thinking. Instead of

project  attempts   to follow  the journey  of   multiple teachers     participating in   intensive, long-term professional
development. Our case study of Mrs. Charles provides a small vignette in that larger story of change. This account

professional development. For a teacher that easily adopts a student-centered stance in the classroom and is often
responsive to student ideas    at least for use in experimentation     defining a learning progression involves more than
an  analysis   of  moment-by-moment     responsiveness.   X()+2*7'()-(." U2*:" H1'2C+*>*" +A-*7+30C0.-/'C" <2'3-(." 0<"
