        practices    as rooted   in the  complex,      evolving  system   of classroom.      Employing    a
        sociocultural-historical lens, we illustrated through close discourse analysis how a high

        take place in certain situations and sustain, and how the teacher and students participate

        epistemic stances constructed overtime. Based on such findings, we suggested that the
        field    should consider    promoting    classroom   scientific argumentation     as  a  long-term
        process, requiring supportive resources to be developed through continuous interactions.

A rgumentation: Structure, Skills and C lassroom Norm
Over the last half century, scholarly views of science have shifted from a dominant focus on experimental
processes  to increasing  concerns   about   its socially  constructed  nature  (Driver,   Leach,  Millar  &  Scott,
1996). Conceiving science as ongoing human activities, philosophers of science have suggested scientific
argumentation    as  playing a  central role in  the   production   of scientific knowledge,     constituting a core

science education has made efforts to promote scientific argumentation practices (NRC, 1996, 2000; Kelly,
Druker, & Chen, 1998; Driver, Newton, & Osborn, 2000).
        A framework commonly used by educational researchers to conceptualize argumentation derives
from G2#0,-&'!    (1958)  Use   of Arguments     (Bell &   Linn, 2000;  Driver,   et al, 2000).  While the  original
purpose of G2#0,-&'! work was to challenge the traditional, inference-centered view of argument with
practical emphasis on justification, it was reduced to a model consisting of the typical structural elements of
argument and their functional relationships. In short, data refered to the evidence used to support a claimH
the point-making     statement, and warrants     were  the logical  statements  bridging   data  and claim.   (Other
elements of his framework -qualifier, rebuttal and backing !are less frequently employed in educational
research).
        This general account of formal argument has been modified into important tools for examining
and evaluating argumentation practices in classroom (Kelly, et al, 1998; Jime´nez-Aleixandre, Bugallo-
I2$*JK+#%L5(;(M#!1305(NOOOA(P*$#*)&5(Q-,2&5(;(R!/2*&%5(NOOSA(M)F!2&(;(T%&.-00%5(NOO>DE Some directly
applied a Toulmian model as the coding scheme, analyzing argumentation discourse for how frequently
specific structural components got involved (Kelly, et al, 1998; Jime´nez-Aleixandre, et al, 2000); others
developed scaling measurements, assessing student arguments based on structural completeness              (Erduran,
Simon, & Osborne, 2004; Dawson & Venville, 2009). With similar emphasis, early work from Kuhn (1991,
1993), though not employing a Toulmian framework, also linked argument structure with cognitive skills in
coordinating theoretical claims and evidence.
        Findings from research focusing on argumentation structure point to both the incomplete structure

students often argued by stating their claims without justification through warrants and data (Jime´nez-
Aleixandre,   et al, 2000;   Dawson   &  Venville,     2009).   Through  interview   studies, Kuhn   (1991,   1993)
suggested that adolescents and lay adults lack the skills to distinguish data and theoretical explanation of
data. These deficiency explanations motivated the development of specific curriculum and instructional

         While this research proves prevalent, its guiding framework and overarching goal greatly limits
the scope  of  understanding  on classroom    scientific   argumentations.   As  a structural account     of formal
arguments, Toulminian scheme provides neither tools nor language for analyzing argumentation as a goal-
driven, socially constructed discourse phenomenon, embedded in either classroom discourse or the broader
discourse of science (Kelly, et al 1998; Driver, et al, 2000). Judging the quality of a scientific argument
according to structural features, in separation from its functional role and the cultural-historical contexts in
which it is rooted, can be misleading. First, as Kelly et al (1998) suggested, language can be flexibly used
in  conversation, and the   need for  justification is   often shaped    by the  interactive  history  and   shared
knowledge. He noted it was difficult to identify components of an argument without considering the related
contexts and   conversational dynamics,  and   even  more    difficult "2( ,)U%( 6)-*( -&6%*%&1%( 2&( -&$-.-$#)0!'(
abilities or skills in argumentation based on the structure of their arguments in an interactive discourse.
         Second, the value of argumentation in science rests in its power to resolve scientific discrepancy
(Driver, et al, 2000). If argumentation skills get foregrounded and established as the learning goal, but
learners are  not pursuing  something  that would    raise  the   need to argue,   we  have  little to ensure   that
argumentation gets developed as a useful discourse tool that students can draw on, and risk making parts of
an argument another school-defined convention.
         With such concerns, some scholars suggested that scientific argumentation should be established
as a classroom norm (Driver et al, 2000; Engle & Conant, 2002). They called for argumentation to become
evident in discourse patterns that permeate a variety of classroom activities, emerging naturally as part of
!"#$%&"!'( *%+#0)*( !%&!%-making interactions. In   alignment,    recent research  has  begun  to   investigate the
complexity of classroom argumentation phenomena, taking into account multiple, interdependent factors of
the learning  environments.   Studies on how    learning    contexts   motivate   engagement   in   argumentation
suggested the important roles of factors such as social norms of classroom interactions (Berland & Reiser,
2009) and epistemological resources (Louca, Elby, & Hammer, 2004). In a case study of an emergent and
lasting  classroom  argumentation,   Engle  and   Conant    (2002)   demonstrated    how   a  10)!!'( $-!1-40-&)*7(
engagement was constructed through continuous effort in fostering a learning community that encompassed
such  features as  attitude and  values  towards    controversial    ideas,  positions   and  roles    of students,
accountability for disciplinary norms, and supportive classroom resources. This line of research conveys a
resounding message: to understand classroom affordance of meaningful argumentation practices, we need
to look into the non-linear, multifaceted development of classroom learning environments.
         Following this train of thought, our study explores how classroom norms conducive to scientific
argumentation take shape and give *-!%( "2( !"#$%&"!'( !%&!%( ,)U-&+( -&"%*)1"-2&! in a high school science
classroom. From    a sociocultural-historical  perspective   (Vygotsky,     1978;  Engestrom,  1987),     we  view
learning as continuously occurring in interactions between the social and individual planes, mediated by
artifacts and sociocultural contexts and developed through the interactive history of the specific group and
broader communities. From there we ask these questions:
What affords or constrains the use of scientific argumentation in science classrooms?
How  do   classroom  affordances  and  constraints   of    argumentation    get  constructed  over   time  through
classroom interactions?

The lens of localized activity theory
The dynamic and evolving view of classroom activities came from the theoretical lens of Activity Theory
(Engestrom, 1987, 1999). According to this model, in a continuously changing activity system, collected
subjects conduct object-driven activities that provide the momentum for its changes. Their actions and
interactions towards the object are mediated by material and symbolic artifacts as well as factors from the
broader contexts such as rules, community and labor division. Localizing this framework to fit the specific
features of my subject, we consider a classroom as an activity system in which teacher and students carry
out activities driven by overarching and specific learning objects, or other classroom/school related objects
(such getting familiar with each other, setting dates for exam). These activities are conducted employing

material tools (such as textbooks) and communicative tools (such as language). Contextually, activities are
also shaped by norms and routines of a classroom (rules), values and norms held by the educational system
(community), as well as the roles of and the relationship between teacher and students (labor division). I
referred to all these factors as classroom mediational resources.

functional common     ground,  that is, when   functioning     together, they  afford certain interactions and
constrain others.
           Mediational resources get constructed in interaction, both explicitly and implicitly. Explicit
construction occurs through actions/interaction with clear goals of setting up resources for current and/or
future learning activities. Such situations, do not appear as common as implicit constructions, in which the
interactions are not focusing on setting up resources, but as certain discourse and participation patterns,
compatible values, norms and relationship that emerge and hold potential to mediate current and future
interactions.
           Within this framework, scientific argumentation is a general form of interaction serving the
objects of different classroom activities. For such interactions to emerge, the class needs to develop shared
understandings of when argumentation is allowed, what type of language to use and how to participate. The
norm of argumentation also needs to be compatible with other classroom norms, both content wise and

complexity of an evolving classroom system.      The influence of mediational resources for argumentation
extends beyond    structural concerns   to content,   purpose, values    and participation patterns of specific

Data Source and Methodology
To investigate classroom affordances and constraints on scientific argumentation, we videotaped a teacher's
(Sarah's) class for a full semester (September 2008- January 2009).       The class was an ethnically diverse,
32&2*'!(0%.%05(biology class, comprised of 24 students, with a roughly balanced gender ratio and a mix of
9th, 10th and 11th grade students. At the time of this study, Sarah was in her 3rd year teaching biology in a
large, suburban-urban fringe public high school. She had participated in a university-based collaborative
*%!%)*13(4*2[%1"("3)"(!2#+3"("2(/%""%*(#&$%*!")&$("%)13%*!'(curricular modifications. During that project, she
was identified by researchers as relatively good at scaffolding student argumentation and as a teacher who
strove to facilitate students' participation in other scientific inquiry practices, despite institutional pressures
associated with   standardized   curriculum  guides    and   high-stakes  testing that  could  focus   attention
elsewhere.
        Our analysis of classroom data focused on interactive learning discourses, mainly speech, but
including contextualization cues (Gumperz, 1982; Duranti & Goodwin, 1992) such as eye gaze, gesture,
writing, and visual representation on the board. Initial analysis entailed cataloging summaries of interaction
content of all classroom video, in one to five minute intervals. The thickness of descriptions (Geertz, 1973)
was determined by the richness of the discourse data and how closely it related to the interest of this
researchHthicker where students shared ideas and built arguments.
        We began to identify discourse patterns and shifts on different levels: 1) General discourse
structure, such as triadic dialogue (Lemke, 1990), reflective toss (van Zee & Minstrell, 1997), and back-
and-forth argumentation (Cazden, 1988); 2) Ways in which productive learning interactions were initiated
and maintained,   which included type and amount of teacher scaffolding; 3)    (i.e.: scientific language and
everyday language (Lemke, 1990)); and 4) Patterns of expressions (common words or phrases).
        Episodes bearing patterns or demonstrating shifts in patterns were transcribed and subjected to
closer analysis in order to draw out meanings of discourses and gain insight into the social processes
underlying the learning interactions. (Gee, 2000; Erickson, 2004; Kelly, 2005). To do this, we summarized
participation and discourse features of each episode. We then worked backwards (and forwards) to try to
identify an interactive history through which parallel features emerged. Analyses across episodes helped

   classroom learning.

   Data Analysis
   To illustrate how such theoretical and methodological frameworks guide our analysis, we draw on several
   representative argumentation episodes from the class we studied.

   The first one took place during a class review of biotic relationships (predation; commensalism; mutualism;
   parasitism), which is a month into the fall semester and a week after they took notes on that topic. The
   teacher Sarah asked students to name and explain the meanings of different biotic relationships. After she
   confirmed that parasites usually do not kill the host, one student threw in a challenging question and a

examining this episode as embedded in the interactive history of classroom, we have identified previous episodes
that share or contrast this episode in certain discourse features. Through comparing multiple episodes, we analyze
how mediational resources conducive to scientific argumentation get constructed, and contribute to the features and
participation patterns seen here. The following section demonstrated the construction of one piece of such resources.

          This conversation did not end there. Students offered an alternative answer, and one student provided a
piece of reasoning that would support the claim: there would be less water in tea made with hot water due to
evaporation, so there    would be a   higher       concentration   of tea.   This argument was not taken     seriously and

         In   contrast to the  student-initiated  predation   and  parasitism-predation  argumentation,     although  this tea

encouraged argumentation by pushing back reasoning-lacking agreement; she probed students for reasoning, and
communicated the purpose of her discursive move; finally, by requesting students to articulate a chain of reasoning,
she claimed value for this spark of scientific thinking, and set an example for the class on how to focus on the
scientific substance of ideas.
         When contextualized in the larger picture of school education and the settings of this classroom, what gets
communicated here is much more than what has been explicitly said. By explicitly associating her discursive move
with promoting disagreement, and by attending to the scientific substance of an idea the class laughed at, Sarah also
negotiated with the class a shift in the general goal and values of science learning. This shift, we would argue, is a
piece of resource that could contribute to the ways in which students attended to ideas in later argumentation (such
as in the parasitism-predation discussion).
         We have identified other resources through comparative analysis of episodes of classroom interactions.
Due to the page limit, we summarize them in the findings but would not go into details here.

Constraints on Classroom Argumentation
         While    S)*)3'!( 10)!!   has constructed     significant  affordances   for  student   participation   in scientific
argumentation, it is not the case that scientific argumentations can be developed towards any direction at any time.
We saw constraints on argumentation in that class. For example, the parasitism-predation argumentation lasted for a
few minutes and did not develop to its fullest. The conversation was called to an end when students started to

game, and     not all argumentation   are   permitted.    The predation-paratism    exchange    showed   how   the  class  was
afforded   to go  on   tangents, initiating and  sustaining   argumentation    in an   activity not particularly   framed  for
scientific debate  or  open-ended   scientific   discussion.  In  that  part, the arguments     focused on  demarcating    the
concepts   of  parasitism  and    predation.   Y2F%.%*5( F-"3( "-+3"%*( 2/[%1"-.%!( 26( )( *%.-%F( )1"-.-"7'!( 2/[%1"( 2&(
understanding biotic relationships, redirecting the conversation was not an option. In previous classes, we have
observed   situations  when   similar  tangential argument      got accepted   and  followed    in activity with   looser  and
multifaceted objects (not shown here): for one thing, the activity was set up as a chance for everyone to participate,

Research Findings
The major finding of this research, as partially depicted in the analysis above, is a more contextualized account of
classroom   scientific  argumentation.   We    go beyond    evaluating    and  boosting  certain   argumentation    structures,
moving   into  the  construction  and  functioning     of argumentation-related    classroom    mediational  resources.    Our
analysis   demonstrates   how  classroom    norms, rules,   teacher-student   relationship and   discourse  patterns  formed

continuous classroom discourse and the long term consequence of interactions. Considering classroom interactions
as the process of constructing learning related, shared mediated resources may help teachers and teacher educators to
reflect on teaching practices and understand teaching effectiveness from a more constructive, long-term perspective.
While activity theory has established theoretical account of how activity system can evolve locally on itself, little
work   has been   done    to illustrate such   process  with   data. Through    thick  description  on  the  construction  and
functioning of  shared    mediational   resources   in science   classroom,  this  study also   provided   a concrete account
corresponding with such theoretical processes.
