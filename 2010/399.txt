         A bst ract :  Our study expands current literature on the professional growth of experienced
         teachers in educational innovations. Using a case study approach, weinvestigate changes in
         instructional practice of an experienced science teacher over two cohortsof students in the
         context    of a   content  innovation,  and   reveal    the   reasons  behind   these   changes. The
         Interconnected Model of Teacher Professional Growthframework is used to interpret findings.

Introduction
Teachers  continually     draw upon a range  of  experiences     and  information to help  mediate  their learning and
teaching  in new    contexts,  but  these vary  according     to their beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions  (Clark  &
Hollisworth, 2002). Although theories and models of teacher learning and growth already exist, most studies
focus on novice teacher learning, and very few have examined teacher learning and growth for more than a year
(Henze et al., 2009; Mouza, 2009). Our study-in-progress investigates the changes in instructional practice of an
experienced science teacher over two cohorts of students.We compare changes in instructional practice when
novel nanoscience content is taught for the first time in 2008 andagain in 2009. We make the assumption that
when teachers implement innovations learned through professional development (PD), they undergo stages of
change that are a result of underlying factors across various salient domains (Mevarech, 1995).

Theoretical Framework and Research Questions
Drawing from novice-expert and cognitive science literature, we define professional growthas a process of
!"#$%&' ($' )&#!"&*+,' -&$)#.' -/0&.+1' 2&.(&3+1' #$0' 4&*!&4)(/$+' *&%#*0($%' !"(.0*&$,+' -($0+' #$0' .&#*$($%1' #$0'
knowledge and competencies concerning teaching (Richardson & Placier, 2001). There are several models that
offer explanations for teacher professional growth. Sprinthallet al. (1996) classify them into three categories:
craft, expert and interactive. Interactive models integrate both craft and expert models and recognize that growth
is enhanced through reflection of experiences and supported by PD. The Interconnected Model of Teacher
Professional Growth (IMTPG) is one such model (Clark & Hollisworth, 2002). According to IMTPG, change
occurs through mediating processes of reflection and enactment in four distinct domains: persona; lpractice;
consequences; and external. IMTPG acknowledges the non-linearity of professional growth by identifying the
multiple  growth    pathways    between   domains. It  also posits   that  any  interpretation of  growth  requires an
appreciation of the changes across these interconnected domains. As thisinteractive perspective aligns with our
belief that teachers should be actively involved in professional growth through reflectino and enactment, we
chose IMTPG as our analytical tool for interpreting the changes in instructional practice of the teacher as he
repeats  the implementation     for the   second  year. Two    research   questions are   formulated: 1)  how  do  the
instructional practices of an experienced teacher in a content innovation change from the first to the second year
of implementation; and 2) what are the reasons for these changes?

Methods
This study is a slice of a larger project aimed at increasing opportunities in science for students and teachers in
underserved schools. Our project specifically addresses knowledge and workforce development goals in the
emerging field of nanoscience. Teachers participate in a three-week summer PD workshop, where they construct
and pilot nano-related curricular units anchored in cognitively-rich pedagogies, real-world applications, and
information and educational technologies. The participant for this study was Mr. R, an eighth grade science
teacher in a small public K-8 school with six years teaching experiences. The students had Mr. R as theirscience
teacher for at least two years thus he had a good understanding of +)50&$)+,' 4*(/*' 6$/7.&0%&' #$0' #4)()50&+' ($'
science. A   case study   approach  was   adopted  to compare     the  two cohorts of   students (C1  and C2)  as they
engaged in activities to learn about nanosciencein the fall semesters of 2008 and 2009. The same researcher
observed every 8nano, lesson over the two years. Field notes were analyzed for themesthat indicated changes in
his instructional practices through an iterative process together with the primary investigatoor f the larger project.
Teacher interviews conducted at the end of each implementationgave insights into the reasons for the changes.

Preliminary Findings and Discussion
Mr. R conducted the same activities for both cohorts of students. These included experiments, a problme -based
learning project and a digital media production. We illustrate in depth only one difference in the implementation

delivering   the novel    content and fulfilling  the requirement      of  the  project to facilitating deeper student
understanding    of   the novel content.  In terms  of   general   sequence    and structure,  Mr. R  infused  the  new

nanoscience content within the atomic theory unit of physical science curriculum for C1, whereas for C2, the
new content was introduced only after the atomic theory unit had been taught. Mr. R explained that the change
in the implementation sequence was for organizational coherence in the way the content was taught andhte pre-
requisite understanding of other concepts.

        [It is] organizationally easier to do nano at the end of the standard unit. I want to complete the
        syllabus first before I go into nano. Last year, it was some nano, then atomic theory, then nano

        high school, I have to teach so much of the background stuff fisrt before I can get to the
        problem. I !"#$% teach about unique properties of nanotechnology if the kids d/$,)'6$/7'7"#)'
        properties are. (Interviews, Oct 22 and 24, 2009)

        We used IMTPG to map the reasons for the changes: i) For C1, Mr. R infused nanoscience concepts
into the curriculum because he was told to do so during the PD. This is a straightforwardcase of an external

for C2, Mr. R tried a new sequence with the knowledge and experience of the first year outcomes; iv) With the
second experimentation, a more coherent sequence was developed; v) Mr. R reflected and preferred the revision.
His belief in this new organization was affirmed, causni g a change in his personal domain. The observation of

innovations were observed to depend extensively on the in-service designers and mentors in applying the new
knowledge   in  classroom     practice, behaviors   consistent       with those   of  novice    teachers.  The  follow-up
observations of the subsequent implementation allow us to see the changes and infer the active processes of
enactment and reflection undertaken by the experienced teacher. This suggests that while the external domain
may  have  initiated the innovation     and dictated  how    it   is implemented,    the domains    of consequence    (i.e.,
outcomes)   and   practice (i.e., experimentation)    play      a  more   significant   role in the  adaptation  of   the
implementation. And although still at a preliminary stage of analysis, anecdotally we observed that student
products for C2 showed greater depth of understanding of the novel content. The improved student learning

Conclusions and Implications for Further Research
Few studies have compared changes made by experienced teachers to the instructional practice between the first
and subsequent implementations of educational innovations. However, such investigations are crucial because
they give  important  feedback    to professional   developers     on   how   and why    innovations   are adaptedand/or
sustained. In our study, we have identified domains of consequence and practice playing significant roles in the
adaptation of our innovation. From this finding we suggest that PD incorporates scaffolds to help teachers
during the implementation, especially one that encourages both classroom experimentation and reflection as
deliberate active processes of change, may enhance the success of innovations in terms of adaptation to specific
classrooms and sustainability. Developing such a scaffold will be our long term researhc goal. Further research
will also include other  teachers   with  different characteristics     (e.g. age and  teaching  experience)   engaged  in
similar innovations for a more generalizable and definitive conclusion.
