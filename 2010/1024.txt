       Abstract: This study compared three pedagogical approaches on the acquisition and robust
       understanding of  the control  of variables  strategy   (CVS).  In Sao Pedro et al.  (2009), we
       showed that   two  direct  learning conditions      (with  and without reification) significantly
       outperformed  the discovery   learning condition    for constructing unconfounded    experiments
       starting from an initially multiply confounded experimental setup. In the study described here,
       we retested 57 students   six months   later on   constructing  unconfounded experiments   in a
       virtual ramp environment, solving problems requiring CVS, and explaining CVS. Collapsing
       over time, we found that the direct+reify condition had more robust learning than either the
       direct-no reify or discovery learning conditions on constructing unconfounded experiments.
       At the delayed posttest, we found a strong trend favoring the direct+reify condition over the
       other conditions as measured by tasks designing unconfounded experiments starting from a
       multiply confounded state.

Introduction
       Currently, there is a debate in the science education community regarding the effectiveness of
discovery vs. direct instruction. Critics of discovery learning claim that it may be less effective when compared
to instructional approaches with emphasis on guidance (Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006). In particular, it has
been found that during open-ended inquiry, students can have many false starts (Schauble, 1990), and have
difficulty designing effective experiments, forming testable hypotheses, adequately monitoring what they do (de
Jong, 2006), linking hypotheses and data, and drawing correct conclusions (Klahr & Dunbar, 1988; Kuhn,
Garcia-Mila, Zohar, & Andersen, 1995). On the other hand, direct instruction, in its traditional form, has also
received criticism, namely, that it can turn into rote instruction leading students to lose engagementand develop
inert knowledge that cannot be flexibly applied ortransferred (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1989).
       Within these approaches, researchers have begun to determine if these instructional paradigms yield
successful transfer of knowledge and skills. Some have shown that explicitly teaching strategies and skills in
one context can successfully transfer to another context (Klahr & Nigam 2004; VanLehn et al., 2005) or domain
(Chi & VanLehn, 2007). More specifically and relevant to the present study, Klahr and Nigam (2004) found that
students who were taught the control of variables strategy (CVS) in a direct learning condition significantly
outperformed those in a discovery learning condition on a near-transfer test of CVS. Furthermore, those who
mastered CVS, irrespective of learning condition, outperformed non-masters on a near-transfer test of this skill.
These results suggest that the purported benefits of discovery learning, particularly the deeper learning, may not
always occur. These Klahr and Nigam (2004) findings, though, are not without critique (cf., Hmelo-Silver,
Duncan, & Chinn, 2007). Others such as Kuhn (2005) have criticized Klahr and Nigam because they did not test
students' knowledge about when and why to use CVS.
       In a similar vein, others have explored the degreeto which these instructional paradigms lead to long-
term robustness of skills. For example, Strand-Cary and Klahr (2008) compared the long-term effectiveness of
guided and unguided approaches to teaching CVS by repeatedly testing students over a much longer period of
time, up to 3 years after their initial intervention. They found significant differences in skill at constructing
unconfounded experiments favoring their explicit instruction condition immediately after their intervention, but
that 3 months later, those in their exploration condition caught up to the explicit instruction group on average.
Furthermore, those who mastered CVS by the 3 month mark, irrespective of condition, significantly
outperformed non-CVS masters on transfer tasks 3 years later. Dean and Kuhn (2006) explored the role of
practice and engagement within the direct and discovery frameworks on robust acquisition of CVS. Theyfound
that direct instruction alone did not lead to robust acquisition; practice and engagement, irrespective of initially
receiving instruction, produced deep, lasting learning. In our work, we explored the role that self-explanation
played in long-term retention and transfer of CVS skill.
       Our first study, Sao Pedro, Gobert, Heffernan, & Beck (2009), an extension to Klahr and Nigam's
(2004) study, compared the effectiveness of two types of direct instruction versus discovery with regard to the
acquisition and transfer of CVS. We hypothesized that the self-explanation component in Klahr and Nigam's
direct instruction condition could have played a role in students' acquisition of CVS. By adding our third
condition, direct no-reify, which removed promptingfor student explanations, we empirically tested if the

explanations in the direct+reify condition affected the acquisition of CVS. The terms "direct" and "discovery"
have slightly different meanings than is reflected in our learning conditions; that is, these terms typically
represent polar opposites in terms of level of directedness given to students. Our direct instruction conditions
portray variants of guided inquiry in which students are taught the procedure of CVS in a concrete context, a
virtual ramp environment. Our results showed that in an immediate posttest following the interventions, students
in both direct conditions significantly outperformed students in the discovery condition on tasks involving
creating unconfounded experiments starting from an initally multiply confounded setup. The direct conditions,
however, did not significantly differ from each other.
          In the present study, we tested the efficacy of the reification task (self-explanation) on the acquisition
and robust understanding of CVS over time, 6 months after the original Sao Pedro et al. (2009) study by
administering a delayed posttest on participants from our original study. We compared the conditions on the
understanding of CVS as evidenced by their skills at constructing unconfounded ramp setups, explaining the
CVS procedure, and solving multiple choice and open response problems requiring CVS. Self-explanation has
been found to support deep learning (Chi M. T., 1996) and knowledge intgegration (Linn & Hsi, 2000). Thus, in
this study, we hypothesized participants in the direct+reify group would outperform the other conditions even
though the direct-no reify group showed the same performance as direct+reify for certain items at the immediate
posttest (Sao Pedro et al, 2009).

Method

Participants
Participants were seventh-grade students from a public middle school in central Massachusetts. We chose this
group because middle school may be the time to optimally learn model-based inquiry skills (Schunn, Raghavan,
& Cho,   2007). Participants  all  had  the same      science  teacher  through the school year  who   taught    five
heterogeneously grouped sections. Students at this school typically struggle with science. For example, in 2008,
92% of eighth grade students at this school scored below proficient on the science MCAS exam, a standardized
test administered by the  state   (Massachusetts     Department  of  Elementary  and  Secondary Education     (ESE),
2008).
        All class sections participated in the experiment. For this paper, we concerned ourselves only with the
performance of those students who completed our initial intervention and posttest (Sao Pedro et al, 2009) as
well as the delayed posttest. Further, we did not include data from students on individual education programs
(IEPs) and one additional student who used an incorrect web browser during the initial intervention, leaving a
total of 57 students in the analyses for this study.

Materials
We used The Science ASSISTment System (Gobert et al., 2007; Gobert et al., 2009), a web-based intelligent
tutoring system, to host our materials, run randomized controlled experiments and log time-stamped student
interactions with the system. We used several types of activities to assess students' acquisition of CVS. Students
practiced authentic inquiry by constructing unconfounded experiments using our virtual ramp environment. The
same  ramp activity acted  as a   near-transfer performance     assessment. We   also developed a far  transfer  test
involving several multiple choice   and open    response    questions. Some were  designed by us  and  others   were
obtained from a study conducted by Strand-Cary and Klahr (2008).

Ramp Environment
The ramp environment (Figure 1) was developed using the OpenLaszlo framework (www.openlaszlo.org). We
created different kinds of questions by embedding the ramp environment within the ASSISTment System. The
ramp apparatus has four variables that can be manipulated: surface (smooth or rough), ball type (golf or rubber),
steepness (low or high), and run length (long or short). The objective is to set up the ramps so that the target
variable is contrasted and all other variables are held constant. Pressing the "run" button causes each ball to roll
down its respective ramp. Depending on each ramp's settings, the ball will roll different distances. Participants
submit their final setup using the "submit" button. Pressing "reset" causes the balls to be placed back on the
ramp and clears the distances rolled. On each press of the "run" or "submit" button, student information is
logged. This includes a timestamp of the run or submission, the correctness of their setup in terms of CVS, and
the current and previous ramp value settings.
        Unlike the physical and virtual environments used in Klahr and Nigam (2004) and Strand-Cary and
Klahr (2008) in which participants set up ramp conditions starting from a blank slate, our ramp setup was
always initially set. There was always an initial condition students must change in order to create an
unconfounded experiment. In a sense, this activitycan be viewed as an experimental setup repair task since
students must morph a given setup into one that follows CVS. The experiment's starting state could initially be
unconfounded (all variables are controlled), singly confounded (one variable is not controlled), multiply

confounded (more than one variable is not controlled), and/or uncontrasted (the target variable is unchanged).
Our instruction and feedback format was also different from previous studies; the CVS explanations given to the
direct conditions were entirely computer-based whereas the other studies both used human tutoring.

                            Figure 1. ASSISTment question using the ramp
                            environment. This setup is uncontrasted and singly
                            confounded because the target variable, run length,is
                            the same for each setup and one extraneous variable,
                            surface, is not controlled.

Multiple Choice and Open Response Transfer Items
In Sao Pedro et al (2009), we developed three multiple choice and two open response items to assess students'
skills in using CVS to solve problems and in communicating the procedure. We reused these exact items again
for this study. The multiple choice items, referred to as the WPI CVS Inquiry items, asked students to identify
an unconfounded experiment, identify a CVS procedure step, and determine an appropriate experimental setup
with a valid control condition. The two open response items asked students to describe in their own words the
CVS procedure. Specifically, they asked how (1) they "could determine if one particular variable affects how far
the ball rolls in the ramp experiment" and (2) "when there are many variables that can be changes, explain how
[they] could determine how each variable affects the distance the ball rolls." Students needed to clearly state that
CVS was a procedure one could systematically repeat to find out how each variable affected the outcome.
         For this study, we also added two multiple choice items and one open response item from a transfer test
developed by Strand-Cary and Klahr (2008). Their multiple choice items on plant and seed growth required
students to choose  the correct experimental  setup  that   contrasted a variable of  interest and kept   all others
constant. Their open response item asked, without specific prompting for CVS usage, for students to critique a
confounded experimental design that tested if beetles preferred to live in sun or shade.

Procedure
This study determined the long-term effects of the differing interventions on CVS acquisition using both the
original posttest materials and the new Strand-Cary and Klahr (2008) assessments. In our original October 2008
experiment, students were first pretested on their skillfulness at creating unconfounded experiments in the ramp
environment without receiving feedback. We also tested them on the WPI CVS Inquiry items, multiple choice
questions involving   CVS.  The  ASSISTment    System       then randomly    assigned each student    to either the
direct+reify, direct-no reify, or the discovery condition. In each condition, students practiced how to perform
CVS in the context of the ramp environment. Following the intervention, students were tested on their skill at
constructing unconfounded ramp setups, answering the same WPI CVS multiple choice questions as the pretest,
and explaining in their own words the CVS procedure within the context of the ramp environment.
         In both direct conditions, students were first   asked  to read an  overview  of CVS    with examples   of
confounded and unconfounded ramp setups. In this overview, we did not explain that CVS could be used to
solve problems   in other domains.  After reading the   overview,   students addressed   whether a series  of  ramp
setups had correctly controlled for variables. In the direct+reify condition, participants first responded if a given
ramp configuration enabled them "tell for sure" if a variable affected how far a ball would roll by responding
"yes" or "no". Next, they answered an open response question asking them to explain their reasoning. For the
same ramp setup, students then were allowed to run the experiment as many times as desired without changing

the setups and explained again if they could tell for sure that target variable affected how far the ball would roll.
Finally, students  read   an  explanation   why  the   experiment     was  confounded   or  unconfounded     for  the  target
variable. If the setup was confounded, students were told which variables were confounded. Students in the
direct-no reify condition followed the exact same procedure, except they were not asked the two open response
questions. Students in the discovery condition were instructed to create experiments that tested if a particular
variable affected how far the ball rolled. The discovery condition students were neither given the initial CVS
explanation nor any feedback about the correctness of their experimental setups. All conditions practiced on six
identical initial ramp configurations. For more details on the original experimental procedure, see Sao Pedro,
Gobert, Heffernan, & Beck, (2009).
         The present study took place six months later in June 2009 and acted as a delayed posttest of CVS skill.
Throughout    the  school year,   students  used   the ASSISTment        system   extensively  for  math class   but   not for
science-related   activities. All students  in each   class  section   took   the delayed  posttest irrespective  of   having
participated in the original experiment, though we only analyze those students for whom we have posttest data
from  our  October  2008  experiment.     Students    first answered   the WPI    CVS  Inquiry   multiple-choice    questions
developed in the previous study. Next, students answered the subset of Strand-Cary and Klahr (2008) questions,
including one open response question. Students were then presented a reintroduction to the ramp environment
that described  the ramp      variables and  how   to  interact   with the  simulation.    Students then  constructed     four
unconfounded    ramp  setups    with  different  target variables.   The   initial setups  were  identical  to those   in  the
previous   study's posttest.  Finally,  students again answered      the open     response items in which    they explained
CVS in the context of the ramp experiment.

Scoring
Multiple-choice    questions  were   automatically    scored  by  the  ASSISTment     system   with  a 1 if  correct   or  0 if
incorrect. Correct  ramp      setups demonstrating    CVS     for the  given   target variable  were   awarded    1  point, 0
otherwise. All open response items were hand scored by two different graders according to a rubric. The Strand-
Cary and Klahr (2008) open response question was graded out of 3 points, one point for identifying that the
experimental setup was incorrect, and up to 2 points for correctly explaining the experiment's design flaws.
Maximum points were only awarded if the student addressed the lack of control in the question's experimental
design.
         The  two   ramp  open    response   items were      combined    into one  measure   to  capture skill in   correctly
describing the CVS procedure, marked out of 3 points. Higher scores indicated deeper understanding of CVS.
One point was given for identifying independent and dependent variables and the presence of some relationship
between them. Two points were awarded for stating that the target variable needed to be contrasted and all other
variables should be the same. Three points were given for understanding that CVS should be repeated for each
variable to determine how each individually affected the outcome. For example, a student who received full
credit answered as follows: "For each variable keep the others the same and change one variable at a time."
When reviewing student responses, we realized a large number of students described how each specific variable
affected  the distance   rolled   instead of  describing a      procedure.  If students    answered  with   such  evidential
knowledge, they were scored according to a different rubric and were treated as missing data for this metric.
Students falling into neither category, such as those responding "I don't know" received 0 points.

Results
We analyzed 57 students' immediate and delayed posttest scores to determine which condition(s) yielded better
performance on each CVS measurement: problem solving using CVS via the multiple choice items, articulation
and explanation of CVS via the ramp open response items, and authentic inquiry performance with the ramp
environment.   In  particular,    we  determine    if  self-explanation    in  the  direct+reify   condition led    to better
performance over time for the various near-transfer and far-transfer CVS tasks. We also analyzed if the findings
favoring  the direct+reify    and direct-no  reify groups    over  the discovery    group  on  multiply  confounded     ramp
items were robust for the delayed posttest. For each analysis of variance below, we report partial !2 values as
measurements for effect size.

Differences between Groups on Transfer Items
In these analyses we looked for trend differences between groups at immediate and delayed posttest for the WPI
CVS inquiry test and the ramp open response items. We also compared groups' performance on the Strand-Cary
and Klahr (2008) items. Means and standard deviations for all transfer items are presented in Table 1. Only
students who completed all the questions for a measurement were included in that measurement's analysis. We
conducted a repeated measures ANCOVA to compare performance on the WPI CVS Inquiry multiple choice
items over  time.  The   WPI   CVS    Inquiry  pretest  was   used  as a covariate.   Though   time was  not   a  significant
within-subjects   factor (Wilks   "=1.00,  F(1,48)=0.19,      p=.668,  partial !2=.004),   the  interaction  effect between
time and condition was marginally significant, Wilks "=.907, F(2,48)=2.47, p=.095, partial !2=.093, suggesting

there may have been performance differences between the conditions as time progressed. As Table 1 indicates,
performance   in  the direct-no  reify  condition  was  the same  for   the each    posttest, M=1.25.     Students in   the
direct+reify condition showed better performance on average at the immediate posttest, but did not maintain
those scores. The discovery condition's performance increased on average as time progressed. Condition was
not a significant between-subjects factor, F(2,48)=1.78, p=.179, partial !2=.069. This indicated no performance
differences between the groups when collapsing over time.
         Another  repeated    measures   ANCOVA       determined    if any  intervention    affected    students' skill in
explaining  CVS.  In  this   analysis, we  compared    only   students who  explicated      procedures  for   constructing
unconfounded experiments in response to the two ramp open response questions since some students explained
which variables affected how the ball rolled instead of explaining a procedure. There was neither a significant
effect for time (Wilks "=.98, F(1,21)=0.49, p=.492, partial !2=.023) nor for the interaction between time and
condition, Wilks "=.93, F(2,21)=0.81, p=.460, partial !2=.071. Condition was also not a significant between-
subjects factor, F(2,21)=0.23, p=.800, partial !2=.021.
         Finally, we analyzed if there were differences between the groups on the Strand-Cary and Klahr (2008)
items using an ANOVA. We normalized the beetles open response item in order to equally weight all items for
the dependent measure. No significant difference was found between the groups on this measure, F(2,52) =
0.39, p=.681, partial !2=.015.
         Taking these transfer results as a whole, we saw no significant differences in trends and no significant
differences between   conditions  for  any  of the transfer item subsets.   This   suggests   that our  different learning
conditions did not enable transfer from constructing unconfounded ramp experiments to solving more complex
reasoning  problems   requiring  CVS.   As  for explaining  CVS,  we    believe  we  would    expect   to see  differences
between learning conditions if the questions were worded such that students answered with procedures rather
than evidential statements. We believe this because there were significant differences between groups' overall
skills in constructing unconfounded experiments inthe ramp environment as discussed next.

Comparison of Ramp Items
We compared each condition's skill in constructing unconfounded ramp experiments over time using a repeated
measures ANCOVA. Total ramp scores at each time were dependent measures and total ramp pretest score was
used as a covariate. Means and standard errors for ramp performance over time are shown in Figure 2. Four
students did  not take  the  original  ramp pretest  and  were  not  included   in  this analysis,    leaving 53  students.
Within-subjects tests revealed no significant main effect for time, Wilks "=.97, F(1,49)=1.36, p=.249, partial
!2=.027, and no significant interaction between time and condition, Wilks "=.92, F(2,49)=2.03, p=.143, partial
!2=.076. However, condition was a significant between-subjects factor, F(2,49)=3.26, p=.047, partial !2=.117,
controlling for  ramp  pretest score.  Post hoc comparisons    revealed   that the  direct+reify   condition   constructed
significantly more experiments adhering to CVS than the discovery condition (M=0.92, SE=0.43, p=.037, 95%
CI=[0.06,  1.79]) and    the direct-no  reify  condition  (M=0.98,   SE=0.45,    p=.033,    95%    CI=[0.84,   1.88]).  No
significant difference was found between the direct-no reify and discovery conditions, p=.903.
         Since there was a significant between-subjects effect on condition, we also analyzed group differences
solely at the time-2 delayed posttest using an ANCOVA with ramp pretest score as a covariate. The analysis
yielded  a  main  effect on   condition,  F(2,49)=3.36,   p=.043,   partial !2=.121.     The  ramp    pretest  was  not  a
significant covariate, F(1,49)=1.38, p=.247. Post hoc tests revealed that the direct+reify condition constructed
significantly more    unconfounded     experiments  in  the delayed    posttest as  compared       to the direct-no  reify
condition (M=1.34, SE=0.53, p=.014, 95% CI=[0.29, 2.40]). No significant differences between direct+reify and
discovery, p=.131, and direct-no reify and discovery, p=.306 were found. As shown in Figure 2, the direct+reify

condition improved at the immediate posttest compared to the pretest, the improvement is lost 6 months later at
the delayed posttest. Also, the discovery condition's skills on this CVS authentic inquiry task increased as time
progressed.
         We also compared the number of students proficient at CVS (those who scored at least 3 out of 4 on
the ramp) in each condition at the delayed posttest. We used only those who did not score a perfect 4 out of 4 on
the ramp pretest (49 participants). Of those remaining, 59% (10 out of 17) in the direct+reify condition, 24% (4
out of 17) in the direct-no reify condition, and 33% (5 out of 15) in the discovery condition were proficient.
Though the tallies favor direct+reify over the other conditions, the differences were not significant, #2(2)=4.43,
p=.109. We note that in the delayed posttest, there were more than twice as many CVS-proficient students in the
direct+reify condition as compared to the direct-no reify condition.

Comparison of Ramp Items by Level of Complexity
As  in  our previous   2009  study,                       we  examined      performance        changes   over   time     for  ramp    items of   differing
complexity, namely singly and multiply confounded initial setups. To determine time and condition effects we
conducted   a repeated  measures                        MANCOVA          using  singly     and  multiply     confounded      ramp  items    at each time
point as within subjects factors, condition as a between subjects factor, and singly confounded ramp pretest
score as a covariate. This design mimics the design used in our 2009 analysis. There were neither main effects
on the dependent variate for time (p=.646) nor for the time and condition interaction, p = .31. However, there
was a significant between subjects effect on the dependent variate for condition, Wilks "=.73, F(4,96)=4.18,
p=.004, partial !2=.148.
         ANCOVAs on each dependent measure revealed a main effect for condition for multiply confounded
ramp items, F(2,49)=7.58, p=.001, partial !2=.236 but not for singly confounded ramp items, F(2,49)=1.18,
p=.156, partial !2=.073. Post hoc comparisons between conditions for multiply confounded items revealed that
the direct+reify   condition  created                        significantly   more        unconfounded    experiments         starting from     a multiply
confounded state over both the discovery (M=.62, SE=.19, p=.002, 95% CI=[0.25, 1.00]) and direct-no reify
conditions  (M=.64,   SE=.20,  p=.002,                          95%  CI=[0.24,         1.03]).  Again,   no   significant     differences   were   found
between   direct-no  reify and  discovery,                         p=.949.   As   shown        in    Figures  3 and      4, the direct+reify     condition
maintained    its performance  edge                          over  time   as compared       to    the  other    two   conditions.     Also, though   the
direct+reify and direct-no reify conditions were similar at immediate posttest, the direct-no reify condition did
not show long-term skill in constructing unconfounded experiments as shown by the drop in performance at the
delayed posttest. Again, the discovery condition continued to increase in average performance over time.
         Group differences for the time-2 delayed posttest were also analyzed using a MANCOVA with singly
confounded    ramp   pretest items                       as   a covariate.   The       dependent      variate comprised       of singly   and    multiply
confounded ramp items at time 2 was marginally affected by condition, Wilks "=.84, F(4,96)=2.21, p=.074,
partial !2=.084.   The covariate                        was   also marginally     significant,       Wilks   "=.91,      F(2,48)=2.41,   p=.100,   partial
!2=.091.  Observing    the differences                        more  closely     with     ANCOVAs        on   each     dependent   measure      revealed a
significant effect for condition for multiply confounded ramp items, F(2,49)=4.23, p=.020, partial !2=.147 and a
marginally  significant effect for                       condition   for   singly      confounded     ramp    items,     F(2,49)=2.82,   p=.069,   partial
!2=.103. Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant difference in constructing experiments that followed CVS
starting from a multiply confounded state favoring direct+reify over direct-no reify (M=.73, SE=.26, p=.007,
95% CI=[-0.21, 1.25]), and a marginally significant difference favoring direct+reify over discovery (M=.48,
SE=.25,  p=.061,    95%  CI=[-.02,                        0.97]).  The    direct-no      reify  condition    was  not      significantly different  than
discovery learning condition, p=.350.

Discussion and Conclusions
                                            The primary goal of this research was to compare three pedagogical approaches in terms of their
efficacy at fostering robust understanding of CVS as measured by successful application of CVS and long-term
retention of this skill. Specifically, we examined if direct instruction coupled with self-explanation (direct+reify)
afforded any long-term benefits on CVS acquisition over direct instruction without self-explanation (direct-no
reify) and discovery learning. In Sao Pedro, et al. (2009), we found that students in each learning condition did
not perform significantly better than each other onCVS problem solving and overall construction of
unconfounded experiments. However, those in either direct instruction condition were better at correcting the
more difficult multiply confounded setups to correctly contrast variables than the discovery conditionat the
immediate posttest. When incorporating the results of the delayed posttest administered six months later, direct
instruction with explanation yieded a deeper understanding of CVS, collapsing over time. Looking specifically
at the delayed posttest, those in the direct+reifycondition significantly outperformed the direct-noreify
condition on authentic inquiry items starting from a multiply confounded state. Additionally, those in the
direct+reify condition outperformed those in the discovery condition, but these results were not strong enough
to reach statistical significance. The instruction method did not impact long-term skill to articulate CVS nor
CVS problem solving skill. The differences between our direct and discovery conditions are not as drastic as
those of Klahr and Nigam (2004); this may be attributed to our choice to use text as the means to communicate
instruction as opposed to audio as Klahr and Nigam did.
                                            Our results are comparable to both Strand-Cary and Klahr (2008) and Dean Jr. and Kuhn (2006). Like
us, Strand-Cary and Klahr reported that in a delayed posttest, students in their "discovery" condition, on
average, rose to the levels of their explicit instruction condition at constructing unconfounded experiments. We
concur with their interpretation that students' engagement at constructing unconfounded experiments, though
initially unsuccessful, may have made them more aware of the necessity to control for variables. Furthermore, it
may be possible that students' initial failure primed them for future encounters with the concept (Kapur, 2008).
Further research needs to be conducted to empirically test these claims. Nonetheless, our collective findings
suggest that it is possible for unguided exploration to reach levels comparable to explicit instruction with self-
explanation, albeit more slowly. Additionally, Dean Jr. and Kuhn (2006) found that participants who practiced
CVS regularly, irrespective of whether they received direct instruction or not, were better able to apply the
strategy and make inferences when compared to those receiving direct instruction and not practicing. In their
study, the practice condition dyads provided explanations to each other and entered them into the computer;
these activities could have significantly affected students' knowledge of CVS. In other words, it is difficult to
ascertain whether the robustness of their findings is due to practicing the skill or providing the explanation.
                                            In this paper, we have shown that the reification process (self-explanation), when added to direct
instruction of the skill, supports both efficient acquisition and long-term retention of CVS, as measured by
authentic inquiry performance. Of interest, we also found that on the same measurement, a nontrivial number of
students in our unguided discovery condition were also able to perform, on average, at levels comparable to the
direct+reify condition 6 months after the initial intervention. To address which behaviors within each
intervention led to robust acquisition of CVS, we are looking at the quality of self-explanations, student
responses, and all log files of student interactions within the ramp microworld. This will allow us to characterize
the affordances of each condition for learning CVS and examine interactions with student variables such as
prior knowledge of inquiry, in particular, knowledge of designing and conducting experiments. A fuller
description such as this will provide important data towards our eventual goal of developing adaptive
