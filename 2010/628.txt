         is more important than ever to understand how professional journalists develop their expertise.
         In this paper, we examine an intermediate level reporting practicum course to explore the
         learning processes therein. Using a new method called Epistemic Network Analysis, we also
         explore emergent relationships within developing journalistic expertise. Understanding these
         relationships should be useful for journalism education as well as the design of research on
         learning environments.

Introduction
Increasingly, bloggers and mobile phone eye-witnesses seem to provide the public with al,'#1%'$%!&'#1*#4&'5"#'#6'
see. At the same time seemingly each year, reports (McDonnell         et al., 2008) document the decline in newspaper
readership, speculating that for the few people who still care about the news, Google and other online services
are increasingly the destinations of choice.
         We   argue that despite  commercial     pressures    and  in light  of the explosion  of online  information
technologies, it is more important than ever to understand how professional journalists develop their expertise. It
matters 7%(*.&%'#1*#'%8/%)#"&%'"&' 56(.&%9'6$'#1%' !6):';6<*(1'*$9'=6&%$&#"%,'>?@@AB'9%&()"7%'*&'C6.)$*,"&04&'

         In this paper, we examine one of the ways journalists develop expertise through an ethnographic study
of Journalism 335, an intermediate level reporting practicum course at a large Midwestern university. The main
goal of the study was to explore the learning processes experienced by the students in the course. Using a new
method adapted from social network analysis called epistemic network analysis (Shaffer et al., 2009), we also
explore emergent    relationships within   developing    journalistic  expertise. Understanding   these   relationships
should be useful for journalism education as well as the design of research on learning environments.

in capstone courses and/or professional practicum experiences.
         Shaffer (2004, 2005a), extending Schon, calls this ensemble an epistemic frame, emphasizing that what
makes professional expertise uniquely powerful are the relationships between the elements within the ensemble.
In other words, the particular set of knowledge and skills that is the focus of most D1*$9&-6$F' *//)6*(1es is
interconnected with a particular set of values and identities, forming a coherent and integrated perspective that
professionals use  when   making   professional   judgments     in  the world.   Thus,  a professional   journalist has
mastered a body of writing and reporting knowledge and skills, sees herself and is seen by others as a journalist,
and frames her efforts according to a set of journalistic values and norms.
         Shaffer (2005b) argues that the practicum is designed to help develop this professional epistemic frame

Shaffer (2005b) explores three such participant structures: interactive copy editing of stories with peers and the
professor, news meetings in which participants shared progress and received feedback on their reporting, and
war stories  from the   professor or guest   journalists    providing  lessons  learned   from past  experience. Each

2005b) for one of three professional abilities: writing to formula, writing for story, and writing as a watchdog.
         The ability to write to formula reflects the highly prescribed nature of journalistic writing (Shaffer,
2005b). From capitalization and punctuation rules in the Associated Press (AP) style guide to innumerable how-
to guides for story organization and structure, being able to appropriately use formula is critically important
(Murray,   2000; Edgerton,  1997).  But    this skill is also  bound    with knowing    a particular set  of principles
concerning appropriate usage and application of this skill. It also involves adopting a particular kind of voice, or

identity, within the writing as a way of asserting certain values of neutrality, objectivity, if not truth (Kovach &
Rosenstiel, 2001; Stewart, 1998).
        Writing   for   story,  on the other  hand, focuses    on  the  practices of reporting  and  developing the
particulars of stories in order to realize the broader significance of specific characters and details (Shaffer,
2005b; Franklin, 1986). It employs knowledge about various reporting techniques and tools, skill in their use to
capture key details, as well as knowledge and skill with narrative techniques to most effectively use those

of knowledge,    skill, identity, values and  epistemology   are  bound   together,  and which  should  also  feature
linkages to other sub-frames as part of an overall integrated epistemic frame.
        Shaffer (2005b) argues that each ability is developed separately and then integrated with the others
through the epistemic discourse of the professor, as for example in discussions of how the different practices

epistemic network analysis can provide a quantitative measure of the complex linkages within and between
ensembles of knowing, being, acting and valuing that comprise a professional perspective. Finally, I discuss
how the results of this study may contribute to the design of learning environments.

Methods

Setting

key transitional role   between   highly structured introductory   courses  and   more   open advanced  writing and
reporting courses, thus providing an opportunity to study an early practicum environment.
        J335 was a four-credit course that met twice a week for 75 minutes throughout a 15-week semester.
Students also met outside of class in small groups while working on two different group reporting projects, the
first occurring midway through the semester and the second occurring at the end of the semester. The specific
sequence of assignments is described in the results section.

Participants
The class was comprised of 13 students. There were six seniors and seven juniors, all journalism majors. No
other demographic   information     was  collected about   the  students. The professor,  John,  is a prize-winning
journalist. The class also had five guest speakers, each of whom was a reporter, editor, or publisher at local or
regional newspapers or radio organizations.

Data collection
Data was collected about the course in several ways. Twenty six of the 30 class meetings were observed. During
the semester, students worked on two team reporting projects, and one group was observed for the second
project. This team included four seniors and one junior. Copies of all e-mail messages sent by the professor to
the class and also of messages exchanged among members of the project group were collected and analyzed.
Copies of all story assignments including 76#1'#1%'&#6)-'#%8#'*$9'#1%'/)65%&&6)4&'5%%97*(: were also collected
and analyzed.
        Classroom       data was   collected in digital   audio  recordings  and   supplemented   with  field notes.
Recordings were transcribed to provide a detailed record of interactions, and field notes were used to capture
meaningful non-verbal aspects of the context and supplement the transcripts. Out-of-class group meetings were
documented via field notes.

Data analysis
The data  was   segmented  into  interactive units, which   were   defined as    strips of activity with a  consistent
interactional structure and topical focus. The boundary between strips was marked by either a change in topic or
a change  in interactional structure. In   other words,   when either  the focal   point   of discourse  or the social
arrangement changed, one unit ended and another began. For in-line story feedback, comments targeting the
same passages in a story were treated as occurring within a single unit while comments targeting different parts
of a story were treated as occurring in separate interactive units. Specific examples of classroom interactive
units are provided below in the results section, but in the class the transition was clear and often explicitly
marked by professor (600%$#&',":%'DS,)"+1#3'!%4)%'+6"$+'#6'(1*$+%'+%*)&'$6!'*$9'56(.&'6$'T&60%#1"$+'$%!UGF'
         Strips were   coded for particular  practices,  knowledge,   identities, and   values  of  each of the three
epistemic sub-frames of entry-level journalism identified previously: 1) writing to formula; 2) writing for story;
and 3) writing as a watchdog. Following Shaffer (2005b), segments were coded for writing to formula when

         The result  was a   database of  interactive   units showing  the presence   of epistemic  frame elements
organized by epistemic sub-frames for entry-level journalism as well as the times during which they occurred.
The relationships among these different components were then analyzed using epistemic network analysis.

Epistemic network analysis
Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) adapts the framework of Social Network Analysis (SNA) for use with
cognitive, rather than social, elements (Shaffer et al., 2009). As Shaffer argues, while SNA was developed to
provide insight into the relationships between individuals and groups, it also provides a robust set of analytic
tools for representing and studying networks of relationships in different domains. In ENA, these tools can be
useful for understanding the kinds of linkages between and across elements taking place over time.
         For this study, each epistemic frame element was considered to be a node in the epistemic network
representing the interaction captured in each interaction unit or strip. Links were defined as the co-occurrence of
two or more epistemic frame elements within any strip. Links between the elements of a single sub-frame were
defined as intra-frame links, while links from elements in one sub-frame to those in another were defined as
inter-frame links.
         In order to capture the strength and changes of these links over time, we developed an Integration-
Cohesion (IC) index. The IC index measures the degree to which a given sub-frame or sub-frame element
emphasizes cohesion, by linking more often to elements in the same sub-frame, or integration, by linking more
often to elements of other sub-frames (see Table 2).

Table 2: Intra-frame and Inter-frame linkage formulae

      Intra # frame " !           (Lin )2 (M in #1)              Inter # framesub1 " !       ( Lsub1 )2 (M sub1 )
           Equation 1: intra-frame linkage                             Equation 2: inter-frame linkage

         As provided in Equation 1, the strength of intra-frame linkage for any frame element was calculated by
first summing the   squared   values of the   links between   that element  and   the other frame   elements in   that
%,%0%$#4&' &.7-frame  (Lin), then dividing by   the number    of elements  in the  sub-frame (Min)  minus one,    and
finally taking the square root of the resulting number. As provided in Equation 2, the strength of inter-frame
linkage for any frame element was similarly calculated by first summing the squared values of the links between
a given frame element and the frame elements in one of the other sub-frames (Lsub1), then dividing by the
number of elements in that other sub-frame (Msub1), and finally taking the square root of the resulting number.
The inter-frame calculation was repeated for each of the two sub-frames in which each frame element was not a
member. These values were then summed at each successive interaction unit, producing one intra-frame and two
inter-frame linkage values which reflected the accumulated link behavior to that point in time. Finally, the ICI
was calculated as the difference between the inter-frame linkage value and the intra-frame linkage value at each
successive interaction strip, with   positive values  indicating integration  across  two different sub-frames    and
negative values indicating cohesion within a single sub-frame.

                                and then seek to penetrate those hierarchies. People in charge of those hierarchies often
                                resent those efforts. You're exactly right-there's a tension there. I think the challenge for

write as a watchdog.
                                The ENA picture that emerges for the Writing as a Watchdog sub-frame, shown in Figure 4, is quite
different from the other two sub-frames. In this case, all of the elements are revealed to be linking either
neutrally (neither more internally nor externally linked) or strongly externally as in the case of the skill element,
integrating this sub-frame with the others. These data suggest that interactions throughout the practicum used

828 (Shaffer, 2005b) provides a compelling account of the development of these abilities through the learning
practices of the Journalism 828 practicum. While not surprising, the results of this study do suggest that these
epistemic sub-frames organized student experience throughout the course in ways quite similar to those of the
advanced                          practicum course.   In  addition, the ENA    data provides  a new   perspective on the    ways in which
pedagogy was instantiated on the ground in course interactions

Discussion
These results suggest that over the course of Journalism 335, distinct elements of journalistic expertise were
drawn out and linked together, helping to develop and integrate the epistemic sub-frames of writing to formula,
writing for story, and writing as a watchdog. This confirms similar observations in Shaffer (2005b), suggesting
that, despite being a transitional course, J335 provided an important practicum experience for its journalists in
training.
                                In addition, the results of this study indicate that different sub-frames for specific areas of expertise can
exhibit different developmental patterns, sometimes emphasizing the development of stronger connections with
other elements of the same sub-frame, and sometimes emphasizing stronger connections with elements from
other sub-frames. This in turn suggests an area for future study might be exploring the ways in which developers

of learning environments might best align different kinds of participant structures to take advantage of the
different developmental patterns touched on here.
        These  results also suggest  that the epistemic     network   analysis method    can be productive  way  of
studying interactions within learning environments. Building on Shaffer (2009), this study adds the Integration-
Cohesion  index  to epistemic  network    analysis, to   uncover   particular  linkages  patterns occurring   across
sometimes difficult to see interactions. Epistemic network analysis suggests a powerful set of techniques for
studying the traces of cognitive development through social interaction, and it points toward a promising new
way of observing the translation of pedagogy into practice in various kinds of learning environments.
        The study presented is of course limited. As observations of a single seminar, these results obviously

course, there was   significantly less student-initiated  interaction  than might  have   been  observed   in more
advanced courses. At the same time, these findings do suggest a more complex relationship within and between
these epistemic sub-frames can emerge during the overall development of journalistic expertise, the details of
which deserve future study. They also suggest that the method of epistemic network analysis may be useful for
future investigations of learning environment interactions for a deeper understanding of cognitive development.
