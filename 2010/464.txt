         A bstract: This study examines the ways in which middle school students (N=39) approach
         problems which require scientific reasoning about seasonal change and how this relates to
         their overall improvement across the domain.       Students!"limited use of observable evidence in
         reasoning about observational astronomy concepts indicates the need for further instruction on
         scientific reasoning in this domain.

conceptual knowledge influences their reasoning strategies.

Theoretical Framework
We locate this study of children learning about the seasons in a learning progression framework.                  Learning
progressions (LP) are hypothetical descriptions of how students understanding of big ideas in science become
more sophisticated through targeted instruction across time (e.g. NRC, 2007).         Big ideas hold broad explanatory
power  in the domain,    make  connections  across    isolated  concepts,    and are  developed   over  time   as learners
understanding  them in   increasingly sophisticated    ways    (e.g. NRC,    2007).    One of the central concepts of
astronomy    experienced by humans    is the  changing      of the   seasons; yet  extensive   research  has   shown  the
prevalence of alternative ideas about this conceptual area (e.g. Sharp, 1996) and the resistance learners have
towards developing full understanding (e.g. Schneps & Sadler, 1988). The seasons, in itself is not a big idea but
rather a manifestation of the more generalized concept of celestial motion that unifies this with other related
concepts  in astronomy   (Plummer  &  Krajcik,  2010).      We   do  not present   a  full learning progression,    across
multiple grade-bands in this study; rather we focus on aspect of the progression in more detail and the ways in
which these connect to earlier conceptual development on the progression (Plummer             & Slagle, 2009). Songer et
al. (2009) have laid out the argument for integrating content and inquiry reasoning into learning progressions,
rather than focusing on content alone.    Their learning progression is developed around dual strands: the big
ideas of biodiversity and evidence-based explanations.         The   results of  this preliminary research   on   children
reasoning about the seasons will allow us to take a critical first step towards developing an integrated learning
progression hypothesis and plan for further instruction to test our   theories in celestial   motion.   We are guided by
following questions: 1. Do students provide explanations that make connections to evidence when reasoning
about celestial motion and the season? 2<""=04"%0&("+$.'&*(&%"#$%&'()*$%+$,"02")-&".0$)&$)"+31*.)"()#%&$)(!"#(&"

Research Design
Participants were students in five of Lori Agan!(">)-",'*%&"(.+&$.&"./*((&( (N=39).         The 10-day curriculum was
based on published curricula and teacher-created materials.      The pre/post assessment consisted of six multiple-
choice questions and seven open-responses questions.          The open response questions were assigned codes for
scoring.  Inter-rater reliability for the pre and post open response questions for 15 students (38% of the set) was
94% (by scores) and 89% (by individual codes).        Student responses to both the multiple-choice items and the
open-ended prompts were aligned to levels on a 4-level scoring guide to examine change in understanding.

Results
The results of a paired samples t-test indicates that there was significant improvement from the pretest to the
posttest (t= -7.458; p<0.001). However, only eight students (21%; compared to 1 student prior to instruction)
were able to provide scientifically accurate responses (which did not also include alternative ideas) on at least 6
out of 7 seasons-concept questions.   We present three cases in our anal8(+(" 02" ()#%&$)(!" '&*(0$+$,"about the

make a clear connection between observation and explanation (students did not provide evidence or gave a
reason that did not logically correspond to the evidence they presented).       Second, Table 1 shows the results of
Scenario A (temperature changes with latitude in water along Atlantic Coast) and Scenario B (temperature
changes in water between summer and winter at a set location), where students were specifically prompted to
reason with   what they  know  about   light from the   sun.  This   type of reasoning   is an important   step in  the
progression towards scientific sophistication on the seasons (Plummer & Agan, 2010). Note that this analysis is
not looking at scientifically accurate uses of light and explanations but rather how they attempt to reason in
these situations (change in number of accurate responses is also reported in Table 1).        Significant change was
only found for understanding in Scenario A and increased use of explanation for Scenario B.

Discussion and Implications
Learning to explain the seasons involves the ability to explain observable evidence relating to patterns of change
in sunlight with rotational and orbital motion of the earth on its tilted axis.      Student responses indicate that
additional guidance   in using observational   evidence    will be   necessary   to advance   their ability  to reason
scientifically about the seasons.  First, s)#%&$)(!" *))&31)(" )0" '&*(0$" *60#)" )-&" &*')-!(" '0)*)+0$" (#,,&()(" )-*)"

level of sophistication on the learning progression may have inhibited progress in the more sophisticated levels
(Plummer   &  Agan,   2010).   Second,  students  showed     some    improvement    in scientific knowledge     of how
changes in sunlight across the seasons and across locations on the earth affect seasonal temperature changes.
But many students did not attempt to use sunlight to reason about changes in temperature or to attempt to
explain changes in sunlight.   In our poster, we will consider how instruction in this intervention may have
supported some but not all students in moving forward in their reasoning about the seasons and the implications
for future curriculum   interventions  and   research. Our   results suggest that   successful instruction   along  the
celestial motion progression will first (#110')"()#%&$)("+$"#(&"02")-&"&*')-!("'0)*)+0$"0$"%*+/8"*11*'&$)"30)+0$E"
