         Abstract:   This    study investigates   the impact    of engaging    teacher-education  students  in
         sustained design and knowledge building practices in mathematics teaching on their views of
         mathematics and mathematics teaching. Participants were nine teacher-education students who
         took a university course titled "Middle School Mathematics Teaching." Data primarily came
         from student discourse recorded in a Knowledge Forum database, peer evaluation and video
         analysis   on  student  teaching   practices,   and   an  open-ended   mathematics    belief  survey.
         Preliminary    results  suggest   that teacher-education    students  became     progressively   more
         adaptive   in their teaching   practice. More   importantly,   their views of mathematics     became
         more constructivist-oriented, and in the meantime, their views of mathematics teaching also
         became more student-centered.

Introduction
The purpose of this study is to introduce knowledge building practices into a teacher-education course and to
investigate if such    practices have   any  impacts   on    teacher-education  students' views   of  mathematics    and
mathematics teaching. According to Paul Ernest (1991), there are two general epistemological stances in terms
of views  of   mathematics,   one    often referred   to as  foundationalists  and  absolutists,  the other fallibilists,
humanists, relativists and constructivists (see also Handal, 2003). The fundamental argument of the former is
that mathematics knowledge is certain, cumulative and unaffected by social interests or personal value. On the
other hand, the latter is inclined to believe that mathematics knowledge is through historical, social and cultural,
and that there are limitations to its claims of certainty and absoluteness (Ernest, 1991). While the two views are
opposing to each other, it is accepted that people's epistemological views in general tend to progress slowly
from one that sees knowledge as certain and absolute, to a more relativistic stance that emphasizes knowledge as
uncertain and constructed by individuals (Chai, Hong, & Teo, 2009; Magolda, 2004; King & Kitchner, 1994).
     As for views of mathematics teaching, they may be broadly classified under the knowledge transmission
category or  the knowledge    construction   category    (Entwistle, Skinner,  Entwistle  & Orr,  2000;   Handal, 2003;
Samuelowicz & Bain, 2001). The former category is characterized as teacher-centered, content-based didactic
teaching  practice  that  emphasizes     on   passive    reception   of knowledge   by    students;   and the  later as
student-centered, learning-oriented constructivist instruction that encourages students to actively make sense of
their experiences.
     Previous research indicates that epistemological views are closely in relation to learning in various ways
and have implications for teaching (Pajares, 1992; Richardson, Anders, Tidwell & Lloyd, 1991; Schommer,
1994; Wilson, 1990). Yet, such views are often neglected, or not properly addressed, within teacher education
programs (Nespor, 1987). Despite studies in general suggest that it is possible to change pre-service teachers'
epistemological   views  (e.g.,  see Brownlee,    Purdie  &    Boulton-Lewis,  2001;  Gill, Ashton    &   Algina, 2004;
Howard, McGee, Schwartz & Puecell, 2000), there is no consensus as to what represents a most effective way.
     One    way  to help  teacher-education     students develop   more   constructivist-oriented epistemological    and
pedagogical  views  is  perhaps  to  directly engage     them  in knowledge   building practices  (Chai   & Tan,  2009;
Hargreaves, 1999; Hong, Zhang, Teo, Scardamalia, 2009). Knowledge-building is a social process focused on
the production and continual improvement of ideas of value to a community (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2003) and
is supplemented by the use of a software program called Knowledge Forum. Previous research on in-service
teachers who   have    been  practicing knowledge     building  pedagogy   for  years suggests   that it  may stimulate
epistemological growth among teachers (Chai, Wong & Bopry, 2009; Chai & Tan, 2009; Hong, Zhang, Teo,
Scardamalia, 2009). Therefore, it is posited that engaging teacher-education students in collaborative knowledge
building practices should also have effects on their views about the subject matter they are to teach and about
their teaching methods. Yet, such assumption remains to be examined, especially for the subject of mathematics.
The purpose of the present study is to investigate this claim and our main research questions focus on: How do
knowledge-building     practices affect  students'  learning   processes   and  outcomes?   Specifically,  in  terms  of
processes, we looked into participants' online contribution pattern, social interaction patterns, and patterns in
their teaching practices throughout the semester; and in terms of outcomes, we looked into changes in their
views of mathematics and mathematics teaching.

Method

Context and participants
The present research was conducted in a university course titled "Middle School Mathematics Teaching" in
Taiwan.  The  course     was offered  by  the university's   Center  of   Teacher  Education to  students  who   plan  to
become a mathematics teacher at the middle school level. The university is ranked as one of the best universities
in the nation and    the  students enrolled in  the subject  university   are all academically  high-achievers   and   are
overall considered by the society as the best prospective teachers in the nation. Participants in this study were
four female  and    five  male  teacher-education   students   and  their age ranged   from 19   to 23  years (M  =    21;
SD=1.59).

Instructional approach
We employed an instructional approach that features design-based knowledge building practices (Hong, Zhang,
Teo, &  Scardamalia,      2009). The   main  purpose    of engaging  teacher-education    students  in such practices   is
threefold: (1) to help them understand the nature of teaching as creative and adaptive (Sawyer, 2004), rather
than routine and script-oriented, (2) to help them avoid viewing teaching as merely pursuing best practices of
certain model teachers by means of mastering pre-defined teaching skills; and (3) to enable them to go beyond
"best practices" and assume the role of designer and knowledge-builder in continual improvement of their own
teaching practices.
      To implement, the course was divided into the following four related phases: (1) Initial Design: First,
participants were   guided   to  work  on their initial design   in order  to implement   their first teaching  practice;
accordingly,  they   prepared   lesson plans,  and  learning   materials  and  learning  sheet, etc.; (2) First teaching
practice: Then, based on their initial design, they performed their first teaching practices in class, with the other
classmates serving as the audience. The whole process of each student's teaching practice was video-taped, and,
at the end of each teaching practice, a peer evaluation was conducted to assess the quality of teaching for future
improvement; (3) Re-design: During this phase, participants collectively worked online in Knowledge Forum to
provide feedback and suggestions to the target student who already performed his (or her) teaching practice.
Then he (or she) further reflected on these suggestions, analyzed the recorded video of his (or her) own teaching
practice, and collaborated with other peers to improve his (or her) initial design by co-designing next lesson; and
(4) Second teaching practice: Finally, based on the new instructional design, each participant performed their
second teaching practice; the whole teaching process again was video-taped, and then a second peer evaluation
on the quality of teaching was conducted again.
      In addition, the course also employed other complementary instructional activities, mainly whole-class
and small-group discussion after each teacher-education student's teaching practice, in order to engage them to
frequently reflect on how to improve their own and others' teaching practices. Some questions being discussed
in class were, for example: what have you learned from others' teaching practices; if you were to teach this
lesson again, what would you do differently, and why? There were no fixed or pre-defined answers to most
questions. The   instructor  served   as  a facilitator in  guiding  students  to  explore, discuss   and reflect on   all
questions emerged in class in order to help them construct their own views of mathematics and mathematics
teaching. Knowledge Forum were only used after class and it played an important role as an online space for
students to record all key points generated from class discussion and personal reflection.

Knowledge Forum environment
The learning environments adopted in the present study is Knowledge Forum (KF). It is an online platform that
runs on a multimedia database. KF allows users to simultaneously create and post their ideas in the form of note
into the database, read others' postings, reply to others' notes, search and retrieve records, and organize notes
into more complex knowledge representation. KF runs on both a text-based and graphics-based mode. In the
graphics mode, it shows linkages of postings as a way to represent the interconnectivity and dialogical nature of
knowledge. As such, it also enables the development of ideas to be traced. Figure 1 shows an example of a KF
view (i.e., an open space designed for collaborative problem-solving), within which users are guided to work as
a  community  by    posting  their  problem  of interest,  producing  initial  ideas for problem-solving,   sharing  and
connecting ideas, synthesizing their ideas, and deepening their collective understanding of problems at issue.
Specifically for    this study, the main  problem   of  interest is  concerned    with understanding   of the   nature of
mathematics and mathematics teaching, and in the beginning of the course students generated and shared their
best ideas   (e.g., "What    is mathematics?");    then  they  designed    and  practiced their  mathematics    teaching
according to their initial ideas and try to improve their initial ideas about mathematics teaching through frequent
discussion, reflection, and co-design in Knowledge Forum.

Data Source and Analysis
Data source mainly came from student online discourse, two teaching practices, and a belief survey. First, in
terms of student online discourse, it was recorded in a Knowledge Forum database and we analyzed student
participation patterns (e.g., note creation and reading) and interaction patterns by employing descriptive analysis
and social network analysis. In addition, we also looked into patterns of group feedback and personal reflection,
in terms of each participant's own teaching practices.
     The second set of data came from peer evaluation and video analysis on students' two teaching practices.
In the beginning of the course, students collectively constructed an evaluation form focusing on the following
five categories: objective (one item), learning materials (five items), instructional methods (six items), activities
(six items), and presentation (three items). All items employed a 5-point Likert scale (5=excellent performance,
1=poor   performance). In addition, both    teaching  practices   of each    participant were  videotaped  and then
content-analyzed based on a pre-determined coding scheme highlighting the following three general types of
learning activity: passive, active, and interactive (see Collins, 1996). To analyze, we examined percentage of
time spent in each type of activity during each teaching practice.
     The  third set of  data came   from    a  belief survey,   which   was  designed    based  on Handal's  (2003)
conceptualization of mathematics beliefs concerning the nature of mathematics and that of mathematics teaching.
Accordingly, we  asked  the following eight    open-ended   questions:   (1) What is mathematics?    (2) What  does
"doing mathematics" mean? (3) What is an ideal way to teach mathematics? (4) What are some key factors for
successful mathematics teaching? (5) What makes an ideal mathematics teacher? (6) What is an ideal way to
learn mathematics? (7) What are some key factors for successful mathematics learning? (8) What does an ideal
mathematics  learning  environment  mean    to you?   Of  all questions, questions 1     and 2 concern the nature of
mathematics; and questions 3 to 8 concern the nature of mathematics instruction. To analyze, we employed an
open coding procedure (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Six codes emerged from this coding process (see table 1).
Pair-sampled t-tests were conducted to examine if there were any pre-post differences.

Results and discussion

Online contribution patterns
The overall    online activity and   performance  in  this community     is shown   in Table   2. Throughout   the  whole
semester, participants contributed a total number of 171 notes with a mean number of 17.8 (SD=4.29) notes per
person.  In addition,   other  complementary     online knowledge-building      measures  recorded   in  this community
include number of note read, percentage of note read, number of annotation, number of note revisions, number
of build-on notes, and percentage of notes linked. Overall, the online activities were substantive as compared
with previous research using subjects with similar background (Hong & Lin, accepted). Nevertheless, while
these behavioral measures gave a general picture of how participants worked online in this database, they do not
tell much about how participants actually interacted with one another. To better understand the social dynamics
in the community, a social network analysis (SNA) focusing on network density was conducted.

     SNA was conducted using the automatic assessment tools embedded in the Knowledge Forum. Figure 2
shows the overall interactive and collaborative patterns in the community throughout the whole semester, using
two  indicators  that   are available  in the   Knowledge      Forum:  "note  reading"   (which    indicates  community
awareness   of  contributions   made   by other  peers)  and    "note building-on"   (which    indicates complementary
contributions by the effort to build on to others' work and ideas). Table 3 shows detailed results of participants'
interactions in two knowledge-building stages (using mid-term exam as a point of separation). In this particular
analysis, we used an indicator, called "network density", which is defined as the proportion of connections in a
network relative to the total number possible. The higher the number of the density is, the stronger the social
dynamics a community is implied. An intention of adopting knowledge-building practices in this course is to
transform the traditional way of knowledge-transmission mode of learning into a knowledge-construction mode
that engages these students in collective problem-solving and knowledge work. Therefore, it was expected that
students should   progressively    work  more   collaboratively  in  Knowledge     Forum.   As expected,   there   was   an
increasing  trend   of  social  interactions as  reflected   by the   measures   of density    recorded  online  for this
community      from   the early to   the later  knowledge    building   stages.  Lipponen   Rahikainen,    Lallimo,  and
Hakkarainen    (2003)   regarded   a  social network    density of  .39  for students   building-on  each    other online
messages as adequate. In the present study, the density level is at .94, which indicates a highly satisfactory social
dynamics    of this community.     The SNA     findings alone,  however,    did not tell us much    about the    quality of
interaction in the community. So, we further content-analyzed students' notes to illustrate what they actually did
to help each other improve their teaching practices.
     Table 4 shows the total numbers of group feedback and personal reflection made after the first and before
the second     teaching   practice in terms   of three  dimensions:    instructional   design, learning  materials,  and
presentation skills. There were in total 106 suggestions/comments and 43 times of personal reflections being
made. On    average    each student   received  13.25   suggestions   from  others  and  made  4.78  times    of personal
reflection between the first and the second teaching practices. This suggests that participants' online interaction
were both quite purposeful and practical. The next question to ask is how online interaction, group feedback,
and personal reflection contribute to the improvement of student actual teaching practices.

Patterns in teaching practices
Table 5 shows students' peer evaluation results. It was found that the ratings in the second teaching practice
were significant higher than the first teaching practice in 20 (out of the total 24) aspects of teaching practice.
This suggests that there were significant improvement in students' second teaching practice. While the findings
showed no significant improvement in four aspects--"Clarity of instructional goal" (M=4.49), "Appropriateness
of learning materials" (M=3.98), "knowledge   of the     learning content" (M=4.38),    and  "Time   management"
(M=4.19)--this could be due to ceiling effects as their initial ratings were already very high (i.e., closer to or
beyond point 4, out of the maximum points of five in a Likert scale). One thing worth noting is that the biggest
improvement mainly came from the "Instructional methods" category which in particular highlights adaptive
teaching (e.g., Uses innovative instructional approaches) and student-centered learning (e.g., Promots creative,
critical and higher-level thinking), rather than conventional step-by-step and scripted teaching methods. These
changes are important indicators of adaptive teaching as a central goal of employing design-based knowledge
building practices in the present study was to help participants achieve a more flexible and innovative teaching
approaches.

      Video analysis was further conducted as a form of data triangulation. Table 6 shows analysis results in
terms of percentage of time spent in three different instructional activities during the two teaching practices. It
was found that there was a significant decrease in the percentage of time spent in passive learning activities,
from the first practice (72.1%) to the second practice (46.9%) (t=5.04, df=8, p<.01). In contrast, there was a
significant increase in the percentage of time spent in active learning activities, from the first practice (17.9%) to
the second  practice (36.4%)   (t=-3.79, df=8, p<.01),   and  a  slight increase  in the  percentage of  time spent   in
interactive learning activities (t=-2.15, df=8, p=.064). Overall, our video analysis confirmed that participants'
teaching practice was shifting from a more teacher-centered approach to a more student-centered approach.

Views of mathematics and mathematics teaching
Finally, we  looked  into  whether  engaging   students  in  design-based  knowledge      building practices also  have
effects on their views of mathematics and mathematics teaching. As shown in Table 7, in terms of views of
mathematics, there was a significant drop in scores in the view that emphasizes mathematics as a science of
quantity and calculation (M = 3.67 in the pre-survey and M = 1.67 in the post- survey). In contrast, there is a
significant increase in scores in the view that highlights mathematics as a science of patterns and orders between
the two measurements (M = 0 in the pre-measurement and M = 2.33 in the post- measurement). In sum, the
findings  suggest  that in the    beginning of  the   semester,  teacher-education    students  tended   to  think that
mathematics was all about number calculation or was something that is useful and can be applied to our daily
life. Accordingly, it was assumed that a teacher should focus his or her instructional goal on helping students do
appropriate  mathematics   calculation or   develop   related math   abilities. However,   such  routine mathematics
practices  and training may    only help  students  be  familiar  with  and able   to   acquire some   conceptual   and
procedural  mathematics   knowledge   efficiently. It may   not necessarily help   students to  use mathematics    in a
more creative way. But, after a semester, it was found that the teacher-education students were able to gradually
view mathematics from a more constructive and creative manner. They began to appreciate mathematics as a
science of finding patterns and orders, or as a tool for more constructive learning and problem-solving.
      Accordingly,   they also changed   their views  of   mathematics   teaching.   As shown   in the bottom  part   of

Table  7, there   was  a desirable   (although   insignificant)  drop    in scores    in terms   of the   first three views  of
mathematics teaching, which regard mathematics teaching as a way "to let students practice again and again"
(M = 2.11 in the pre-test and M = 0.44 in the post-test), or a way "to let students understand basic concepts and
procedures"  (M    =  2.56  for the  pre-test and M  =   1.33    for the  post-test), or  a way   "to  train students'  logical
thinking  ability"  ( M  =  4 for  the  pre-test and M   =  3.11  for   the post-test).  In  contrast,  there   is a significant
increase in scores between the pre-measurement (M = 0.22) and the post-measurement (M = 3.56) in terms of
the last  view  of  mathematics     teaching, which  highlights      mathematics   teaching    as   a  way "to   help  students
develop and explore their own way of math learning". Overall, it was found that in the beginning of the semester,
teacher-education     students' views   of mathematics    teaching     is more   teacher-led,    whereas   after   engaging  in
design-based    knowledge     building   practices   for  a   semester,   their  views      of mathematics       became  more
student-centered.

Summary and implication
      In this study, we reported an instructional approach of design-based knowledge building practices among
a group of teacher-education students and investigated the effects of such instructional approach on their views
of mathematics and mathematics teaching. The instructional approach was design-based as participants were
engaged in sustained design, re-design, and co-design activities when planning and practicing their mathematics
teaching. The instructional approach was knowledge building oriented as it highlighted continual production and
improvement of ideas in pursuit of deeper understanding of the nature of mathematics and mathematics teaching.
In  summary,   it was  found    that design-based  knowledge      building   practices   as  an  instructional   approach  was
helpful to promote more interactive and reflective online activities. Moreover, it was found that at the end of the
course, teacher-education students changed their views of mathematics to become more relativist-oriented and
they also  changed    their views    of mathematics   teaching    to  become     more    student-centered.   Arguably,   while
cultivating teachers'   pedagogical     content  knowledge    is important   and  should    always     be included   as part of
overall teaching training in a teacher-education program, our study suggests that it is equally important to help
teacher-education students develop more informed and sophisticated mathematical beliefs. And to enable such
belief change, it will be crucial for teacher education programs to avoid traditional didactic ways of teacher
training, and   adopt  more   constructivist-oriented    instructional    approaches     in order   to cultivate   more  future
teachers who view mathematics teaching as creative and adaptive, rather than routine and ritualistic, practices.
