          supported by appropriate pedagogy. The present study examined the effect of this
          environment      on the   learning  process      during   an M.Ed     literature course    for a
          multidisciplinary group of Jewish and Arab teachers in Israel. The findings were

This article is about the use of the Wiki technology as an alternative platform for the construction of a
shared interpretive space (Sumara, 2002) for the study of literature in the context of an M.Ed program
for experienced   teachers.   It  examines    the  data    from  the   point  of  view  of  a   teacher  educator,
investigating the experience     of her  teaching  with    the purpose    of both   improving   her  work   and   of
contributing to the accumulating knowledge regarding the use of Wiki in professional development
programs for teachers.

Theoretical Background

The Wiki Environment in Educational Settings
The Wiki platform is an environment enabling cooperative and collaborative learning, each participant
being  permitted  to   write,  add,  edit  and    alter any    text  written  within   its  framework     (Leuf   &
Cunningham, 2001). In this sense, Wiki's features create a "low risk" editing environment (Wang &
Beasley, 2008!, providing a multimodal and hypertextual writing platform, transparent to all readers.
Studies examining Wiki-aided teaching found that this environment has many advantages. It fosters
constructivist learning, as well as collaboration and interaction among the students themselves and
between each student and the teacher. The knowledge constructed by students is made available to all
the participants  in the   course   for study and    evaluation    (Morgan,   2004;  Watson,    Boudreau,    York,
Greiner & Wynn, 2008). Moreover, it appears that the level of investigation by students using the Wiki
platform improves,     due to their  being  exposed     to appraisal   by  their colleagues   and others    (Ravid,
2006).  Recently  researchers    recommended      the   incorporation     of Wiki   as a   platform  for    creating
collaborative updated and course-oriented textbooks, in order to empower learners (Ravid, Kalman &
Rafaeli, 2008). As Ruth and Houghton (2009) claim, Wiki is more than a tool, it is a way of learning.
         Satisfaction with learning in the Wiki environment was found to be high, when supported by
appropriate pedagogy     (Ben-Zvi,   2007;  Meshar-Tal      &   Tal-el-Hasid,    2006; Morgan,    2004).    Studies
dealing  with learning   language    and  literature  with   the  help  of   Wiki   show   that this environment
promotes  high-level    reading   comprehension,      a    diversity   of interpretations,   and  dialog    among
interpreters with various cultural backgrounds (Désilets & Paquet, 2005; Faranbaugh, 2007). It also
increases writers' awareness of the effectiveness of critique in improving their written products, their
meticulousness   regarding    spelling  and   syntax,   and  their  sensitivity  to different   context-dependent
modes of writing (Wheeler & Wheeler, 2009).
         Researchers reveal that the success of educational Wiki-based learning projects or their failure
depends on many factors; indeed, the same researchers may sometimes report success and at other
times  describe  difficulties and   discontent (Wang       & Beasley,     2008). It was    also reported    that the
learners' attitude towards Wiki and their time investment in posting varies from one learner to another
(Ravid, Kalman and Rafaeli, 2008; Robertson, 2008). Studies also showed that the specific discipline
and its culture of study affect the success in Wiki-aided learning (Rick & Guzdial, 2006).

Culture and learning via interactive educational technologies
Culture influences its members' ways of thinking and interpreting (Branch, 1997; Matsumoto, 1996).
When teaching with the aid of technological tools two cultural factors should be noted: effects of
cultural attitudes concerning interpersonal communication, and the language and ways of coding and

decoding    knowledge    (Wild,   1999),  as well  as   the    effects of    the learners'  epistemological   and
philosophical perceptions concerning teaching and learning.
Effects of  cultural attitudes  - Researchers  proposed      a variety  of   models  to  explain  the  differences
between cultures, for instance between individualist and collectivist cultures, cultures with high-level
context-dependent      communication     as  opposed      to   cultures   with    low-level  context-dependent
communication,      as  well  as  cultures   capable   of    accepting    ambiguity     and  those    avoiding  it
(Gunawardena, Wilson & Nolla, 2003; Hall, 1966, 1976; Hofstede, 1986; Matsumoto, 1996). Different
cultural codes, culture-dependent information processing and expression, as well as culture-dependent
networks of relationships and norms of interpersonal communication, may cause participants various
problems while studying in multicultural groups in social technological interactive environments such
as Wiki (Gunawardena, Wilson, & Nolla, 2001; Hall, 2006). There are cultures (like western cultures)
in which language is perceived as a tool conveying precise meaning, and other cultures (like the Arab
culture), where it is perceived as a system of linguistic forms, arousing feelings and visual images.
Thus, while one culture pursues functional, precise, explicit and unambiguous use of language, another
prefers affective language, implicit and rich in imagery (Dwairy, 2006; Zaharna, 1995). For instance,
studies showed that students from cultures avoiding ambiguity find online learning environments more
frustrating  than    students   from  cultures     accepting    ambiguity        (Downey,   Wentling, Wentling
& Wadsworth, 2005), and that students writing in a foreign or second language participated less and
were less confident in their contributions (Yilditz & Bichelmeyer, 2003).
Effects  of learners'   perceptions  concerning    teaching     and    learning   - Studies  report    that while
developing their pages on Wiki, many learners find it difficult to cope with the task of knowledge
construction owing to the norms they had become used to, with the teacher not only providing them
with the required knowledge, but also determining the framework for its organization and presentation
(Farabaugh, 2007; Wang & Beasley, 2008). Such difficulties become acute when students, partaking in
a collaborative interactive multicultural learning group, are accustomed to traditional spoon-feeding
ways of teaching and learning; they encounter tremendous obstacles in attempting to adapt to the self-
directed environment     (Alsunbul,  2001).   The   characteristics     of   academic    culture,   which   honors
ownership   of knowledge      and  copyright   laws,   were    also found     to  affect   activity in  the  Wiki
environment; they minimize learners' willingness to allow peers to edit their Wiki pages and their own
willingness to evaluate other students' work (Lindsey, 2006; Wang & Beasley, 2008).
Educational technology and teachers' development- Research on teacher education and educational
technology including Wiki is growing rapidly. The teachers' attitude towards the benefits of technology
for everyday school instruction is a crucial factor affecting technology implementation (Becker, 2000;
Cuban, 2001). If the experience of learning with Wiki undergoes reflective processing and is integrated
in the teachers' curricular thinking, it may be translated into effective use in the planning of teaching
and in sharing experiences with colleagues (Darling-Hammond, Banks, Zumwalt, Gomez, Gamoran
Sherin, Griesdorn & Finn, 2005). A positive experience of the use of the Wiki technology in teacher
education programs will hopefully encourage teachers to subsequently use Wiki in their teaching.
         The current study focuses on the impact of learning with Wiki on the process of the learners'
writing and editing of their contributions as a result of a collaborative activity, within the framework of
in-service M.Ed studies at a college of education in northern Israel.

The Study

Course Context
The M.Ed program of multidisciplinary instruction is intended for experienced teachers from Arab and
Jewish schools from the northern periphery of Israel. The Arab and Jewish sectors in Israel have
separate elementary and secondary educational systems, each one of them having its own language of
instruction  (i.e., Arabic,  Hebrew).    Only  in  higher      education   are   Jews   and Arabs     engaged  in
multicultural  encounters,   sometimes    in very  conflictual   political   contexts.   Studies  examining    the
integration of Arab students in colleges and universities where the language of instruction is Hebrew,
found that Arab students had to cope not only with high level and academic Hebrew, but also with
reading material in English, teaching methods demanding more independent study, and more free and
open relationships   between   students  and  between     them  and    their teachers   (Al-Haj,  1996; Peleg  &
Raslan, 2003).

Course   Participants  - 19  participants took part    in the  course   under    study, 9 Arab   teachers and  10
Jewish teachers. Most teachers were women (typical of the state of the profession in Israel). Their ages
ranged from 26 to 56 years, while half of them were between 41 and 55 years old. ?0!) /!*'0!$4:)
professional experience ranged from three to dozens of years. Twelve of the teachers were teaching in

primary schools and the rest in secondary schools. Only seven of them had studied literature for their
B.A. degree. None of them had previously read the novel studied, nor had any experience of study in
the Wiki environment. The affiliation of the group's members to Arab or Jewish society, their different
mother tongue (i.e., Arabic or Hebrew), were the salient cultural factors distinguishing between them.
As for other factors, such as age and professional identity, the participants had much in common.

Aim and Content of the Course - The aim of the course under study (14 weeks) was to engage the
learners in an encounter with world literature (Cai & Sims Bishop, 1990), and to build up a group
database about the novel The Day Lasts more than a Hundred Years by Chinghiz Aitmatov, sharing
historical,  geographical,    cultural,  and   literary  knowledge,      as  well  as  individual     and  group
interpretations. The assignment was to write an entry about a broad topic in the novel, relating it to
entries written by other colleagues, complementing or expanding them. Writing on the Wiki platform
evolved alongside 10 weekly face-to-face lessons, lasting 90 minutes each. (In the other four weeks
there were   no  F2F  meetings.)  Blended      model  of teaching  &  learning    was preferred    to reduce the
difficulties of adapting to Wiki-based writing, and to enable whole group F2F discussions of the novel
and the written products. The learners were also asked to respond to their colleagues' entries on the

altogether about five months. No specific guidelines for content, style and organization of the entries
were provided, in order to give the learners freedom with respect to their style and interpretations.

Research questions
This paper focuses on the development of the written products on the group's Wiki database.
     1.  What   was   the pace  of the   entry   into activity in the Wiki    environment    and which    factors
         affected it?
     2.  What steps did the learners take and which strategies did they employ in their writing when
         given free rein to carry out literary interpretive tasks in the Wiki environment?

Data Collection and Analysis
The data were derived from three main sources:
Data provided by the Wiki platform: (a) The entries written by the teachers; (b) The remarks on each
entry, written on the discussion board; (c) Data provided by the history of each entry regarding the
number of posts, changes and editing operations made.

writing and editing throughout the course. The written entries were surveyed for the number of linkages

version. Utilization of linkages to their peers' entries (and/or other Internet sites) implied teachers'
adjustment to some of the norms of writing in hypertextual environments as well as their familiarity
with  peers'  products    and contributions.     The  discussion   boards    were  examined     to identify  the

          According to the participants' explanations, the slow entry into writing on the website was due
to four  main  reasons:   (a) less confidence   in   their knowledge    of the language;     (b) the felt need    to
become    well acquainted     with the  text; (c);   their habits  of study,   and   (d) their   attitude towards
technology.
Knowledge of the language was mentioned repeatedly by four of the Arab teachers, their fear of writing
in a faulty style,  of making    linguistic and spelling    mistakes  for  all to see.   When    asked,   the Arab
teachers who were actually teaching Hebrew (6 out of 9 teachers) stated clearly they were more fluent
and proficient in Hebrew academic writing than in their own language; however, when it came to
exposing in public their writing in progress alongside that of their Jewish colleagues, they became less
willing to participate in the activity.
Knowledge of the novel: Native Hebrew speakers read the novel fluently and did not wait for group
discussions in order to continue reading, while eight out of the nine Arabic native speakers read the

it raised. As a result they constructed their initial impression of the novel at a later stage of the course
and started writing their entries later than most of their Jewish colleagues.
Habits of study: Three (33%) Arab teachers expressed frustration regarding the complexity of the task,
which called for their own interpretation of a phenomenon in the novel or outside it, without any
specific guidance regarding content or structure. Their explanations exposed their expectations that the
lecturer would provide them with clear instructions, similar to those usually provided in an academic
course regarding the final paper. The case of thes!)/!*'0!$4:)41-;!$)*&+) .-$!)'*2/%-24)!&/$6)%&/-)/0!)
activity and the crutches they needed drew attention to the difficulty, caused by open assignments in
the transparent Wiki environment as experienced by those who are not confident enough to cope with

community of learners consists of self-aware experienced teachers, this exposure may mentally block
some of them.
Attitude  towards  technology:   Some   older  teachers    who   hesitated in  their first steps  explained     their
difficulties in their reluctance to use technology for writing.
          8''-$+%&9) /-) /0!) #*$/%'%#*&/4:) $!4#-&ses, it appears that their mother tongue, age as well as
learning habits were important factors, affecting the pace of entry into the writing activity.

Steps and Strategies in Writing
Using the word processor: About a third of all participants admitted that they wrote their thought first
on the word processor, placing them on the website only when they were entirely satisfied with what
they had written. This phenomenon may also explain why many entries began to appear on the website
only in the last third of the semester. Seven teachers, Arab and Jewish, mentioned they were incapable
of showing their work in progress to others. Seven others began writing only after composing several
paragraphs on the word processor, but from this point on continued to use the Wiki, without resorting
to the word processor again. Only four Jewish and one Arab teacher presented their work in progress
throughout the course. During the feedback discussion at the end of the course all the teachers agreed
with one of their colleagues' assertion that it was very strange and unusual to skip the private, intimate
and  reassuring step   of working   on   the  draft  papers,  and  that it needed    courage   to expose   partial
products in public.

Duration of writing, editing and revising: The students not only started their task at different points in
time, but also varied in the number of times they posted and edited their entries and in the duration of
their Wiki-based writing periods, as is evident on the following Table (see Table 2):

         Teachers who wrote directly on the website edited their entries fifteen to twenty times in the
course of the semester, worked on it for long periods and expressed explicitly their great involvement
in the novel and their enjoyment of the course. Others posted or edited their posts only 3 to 7 times.

Writing in   a  hyper-textual   environment:  At first   the entries resembled    the usual  type of  academic
writing, the students almost totally ignoring the hypertextual features of the Wiki environment. The
awareness of the need to adapt their writing to a hyper-textual environment developed slowly. An
overall survey   of  the entries' development    revealed    that it took  seven  or  eight  weeks   before the
participants realized what a hypertextual environment could offer.       It occurred only after (a) the entries
had grown     to several   paragraphs  each;    (b) participants   were explicitly    instructed  to read   their
'-11!*92!4:)!&/$%!4)(c) devoting time to F2F review of several entries. At the same time the paragraphs
in their own entries became denser and more in line with the definition of their topic. However, only
small number of links was made by learners to external sites and the use of internal links was moderate
(see Tables 3 and 4).

         This phenomenon may be related to traditional academic writing habits and routines, and to
difficulties to  adjust to interactive hypertextual    norms  of  writing.  Reflections  of  six of  the Jewish
participants support this assumption.

Wiki characteristics expose all the participants to a whole gamut of opinions, voiced throughout the

        A more cautious perusal of the results revealed that alongside the apparent success, certain
limitations and problems must also be taken into account when teaching with Wiki in programs aimed

multicultural study groups.
        The   current  study  focused  on  the first  experience    on  Wiki  of a   heterogeneous group   of
relatively experienced and older teachers, from different cultures and schools; it investigated the way
they made use of the various devices available to them, to improve their written product. These learners

according to the rules and customs of the school in which they were working and the education system
they were used to.
        When such a group of experienced teachers, aware of their professional status, is to assimilate
Wiki-based  learning,  it encounters  obstacles,   stemming    from  their  habitual way   of studying, their
teaching cultures (Feiman-Nemser, & Floden, 1986), as well as their entrenched perceptions of the
appropriate relations between teachers and students and their differing roles in the classroom. The
findings reveal that the issue of ownership of knowledge prevented colleagues from becoming involved

social-constructivist value of the Wiki technology.
        The sense of fellowship among colleagues is not conducive to mutual criticism in the presence
of the lecturer, responsible for giving grades (see also Brett, Forrester, & Fujita, 2009). In this sense,
Wiki-based learning calls for alternative ways of assessment, different from the traditional academic
one.
        The study reinforced previous findings, which maintained that the ways of writing in the Wiki
environment differ from customary academic writing and apparently more than one exposure to Wiki is

had written about the literary work. This phenomenon may be attributed to learners' limited experience
with hypertextual non-linear environments due to their long established habits of learning (Dziuban,
Moskal, & Hartman, 2005).
        The study found that learners in the Wiki environment, not writing in their mother tongue, feel
diffident; here this factor was salient and affected the ongoing process of group learning, since a part of

         When the learners are teachers who have a high opinion of their ability to write and construct
knowledge, the fear of exposure of their weaknesses may cause them misgivings about early posting on
the website.
         Limitations   of the  study:  This  study  suffers  from  limitations   characterizing  'messy'   field
conditions, since it is impossible to differentiate accurately among variables. Moreover, it tells a story
of a single   case study.  Nevertheless,   every  case   study  of Wiki-assisted  teaching   may   enrich  our
knowledge concerning the Wiki impact on learning in diverse contexts. Additional factors, such as the

academic backgrounds of each learner, call for further research in this field while using more modes of
inquiry, such as in-depth interviews of the learners and their teacher.
