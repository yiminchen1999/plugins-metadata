         T his paper reports on the initial development of a program that uses engineering design
         challenges   with middle  school  students     to facilitate  ST E M learning  and interest.  We
         present    the goals and  design  features     of the  modules   and   compare   them  to  other
         successful approaches.    We  also present     data  showing   differences in how  students  who
         worked with the modules perceive engineering.          T he results are discussed as they relate
         to the continued successful design and development of the modules.

         Education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields) is often discussed as
important   to economic   growth.  The project  described     here emerged    from such a  community   concern for
workforce development in a medium size city. The work was spearheaded by the local education foundation.
Before the foundation began its work, the focus on engineering was initially was sparked by a high school that
developed   an  engineering   themed curriculum  to boost     enrollment. The   foundation  started by developing
engineering clubs and camps for elementary school students.        Then the project moved into middle schools to
help build opportunities for theses students. Along with this expansion has come funding to pursue further
design and development.
         The centerpiece of the project is a set of modules that use engineering design challenges.       Students
work on these design challenges each quarter during their middle school years. The goal of the modules is
provide students with experiences that help them learn and motivate their interests in STEM. There are many
potential benefits to the design challenges that suggest that they may enhance STEM learning and motivation.
First, they provide   a meaningful context  for learning     of science and   mathematics.  Second, given that the
challenges involve meaningful applications, students are more likely to see the value of math and science. Third,
students often have misconceptions about how engineers work. Practice working in collaborative groups to
solve engineering problems provides a context that mimics the actual practice of engineers and may reduce
student misconceptions.

*        While in the past engineering challenges have been used in k-12, most of the time they have not been
required in the curriculum (Brophy, Klein, Portsmore, & Rogers, 2008).        So, one potential significance element
is that the project involves the design of engineering challenges for all students. A second significant element is
that the modules involve work in both mathematics and science classes.      Thus, as we study the modules, we can
potentially learn about how to integrate these engineering related themes across the two content domains.       A
third significant element of this project is that the modules are being developed so that students get a glimpse of
the communities of practice of engineers. Finally, a fourth significant element is that the long term goal of this
project is motivation and interest in STEM fields, not just student learning that occurs in the modules. Thus,
there are potential insights that might be gleaned concerning the building long-term motivation and interest.

         As    the modules are being  designed  and revised     we  are using  elements  of design  from  anchored
instruction (CTGV, 1997), Learning by Design (Kolodner, et al., 2003), and the How People Learn Model to
guide our work (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking 1999). Also, since one of our goals is motivational, we also are
designing the modules with theories of interest and motivation in mind (e.g., Hidi & Harackiewicz, 2000). Our
goal is to explore how we can develop and improve modules from these existing models.

         The project is designed to examine both the development of the modules, and outcomes for students,
teachers, and parents.   For this poster, we focus on two different elements.      First, we report quantitative data

showing  differences    in student   perceptions  of  engineering   from   the school   that  was  used  to  develop  the
preliminary versions of the modules. Second, we analyze the currently designed modules in light of classroom
observations, and through comparing them to other successful programs.

*        First, in analyzing the modules in comparison to other initiatives, we learned that our modules are not
as thematically tight nor are the units as long as those of other programs. The concepts covered across the
different challenges involve different types of engineering and different aspects of science, and typically do not
last more than one week or two.       However, they all have the in common idea of designing something in a
collaborative group to solve a problem.      The diversity of topics is intentional.       First it was done to fit within
current math and science standards (the modules were meant to enhance not replace the curriculum). Second it
was done to provide students with evidence of the diversity within fields of engineering. Third, an important
element of design for the modules is that the modules are set up so that the work takes place in science and math
class. We believe   that this feature has potential for helping students recognize    the value of mathematics.     If they
just worked in science class they might not as easily see the importance of mathematics to these challenges. An
initial analysis of a videotape of the implementation of the first module suggests that one issue that needs to be
considered is whether the math class involves a continuation of the design process or whether the goal of
activities in math class is to expand the concepts and facilitate transfer. For example, in a wind-turbine module,
the  science part   of the  activity  involved working   in    groups  to  design   and test the   turbines, whereas  the
mathematics part of the activity involved working with a computer-based simulation of wind turbines.                 The
teacher reviewed    turbine concepts,    and then the  students    and the teacher   filled out  a worksheet   that asked
students to make estimates from graphs, fill in charts, and do other calculations.
         An  additional    feature of this project  is that it has  a  strong  community!based      focus.   We use the
community    focus  in  ways  suggested    by  Bransford    et al. (1999).   First, engineers   in the community     have
volunteered to help with the modules and visit classrooms.       For example, an aerospace engineer was present for
part of the  wind   turbine challenge.   He  told the  students  about   his career  and   helped  the students  work  on
developing their turbines. Hence, there is involvement of the professional community in supporting the work.
Second, the issues addressed by the modules are ones that are important to the community.              For example, the
community is located along a coastal area so a soil erosion challenge was built. Third, there is a pathway to
continuing the emphasis on STEM fields in specialty high schools.
         Finally, as noted earlier, an important element to the modules is an emphasis on the design process

them focus on how the design process is present throughout the modules.              This focus on the design process
along with the connection to engineers of different types from the community provides students who work on
the modules the opportunity to learn that engineering is a collaborative process. Part of the data for the project
involves examining ideas students have about engineering. We asked students whether they agreed, disagreed,
or did not know about statements concerning what engineers do. Students from the school that worked on the
modules were more likely to believe that engineers mainly worked with other people to solve problems, were
more likely to believe that engineers designed things that helped the world, and were more likely to know that
engineers can choose different kinds of jobs than students from a matched comparison school. They were more

is some initial evidence that the beliefs of students may be influenced by the modules.
