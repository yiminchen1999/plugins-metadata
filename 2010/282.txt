       A bst r act : This paper  reports on    a study  to   investigate   the effects  of  collaborative concept
       mapping in a one-device-per-student (1:1) digital learning environment, as compared with
       one-device-to-many-students (1:m), in terms of students' overall learning gains, knowledge
       retention, quality of the concept maps, interactional patterns, and learning perceptions. Guided
       by the methodology of quasi-experimental research, we adopted Group Scribbles (GS) 1.0 in
       our empirical study where students carried out collaborative concept mapping activities in two
       different settings: (a) students working in pairs with one Tablet PC assigned to each of them;
       (b) multiple students sharing a Tablet PC. In particular, we investigated the students' learning
       process, identified and compared various interactional patterns exhibited by the student groups
       who    were   engaged  in   both settings,  and  discussed     how   such group     dynamics   might have
       affected the quality of the student artifacts produced by individual groups.

Introduction
Social study is an integrative theme that applies multiple disciplines of learning concepts and principles to social
life. In most of the routine social study lessons in schools, teachers are in general still practicing didactic
instructions, drill and practice, and continuous assessments. They are learning outcome-oriented but not keen on
ensuring students' thorough understanding of what they learned, which results in the fact that students only
focus on memorizing fragmented knowledge without synthesizing it. This paper reports on a study that aimed to
investigate the process and the effects of collaborative concept mapping in a 1:1 digital learning environment, as
compared    with  1:many  mode.    In particular,  we   are  keen     on exploring     the students' learning process   and
identifying various   interactional patterns   exhibited   by     the student  groups    who  were   engaged    in  the two
collaborative modes   through our     analysis of  student   interview     transcripts  and  video   recordings during   the
activities. Eventually, we triangulated all the data and formulated our findings in the nature of 1:1 and 1:4
computer-supported collaborative concept mapping activities.

Literature Review
One-to-one technology enhanced learning is the way that a student uses at least one computing device with a
networking environment for learning (Chan et al, 2006). The devices used for such a learning mode usually
incorporate the affordances such as: personalization, connectivity and supporting social interactivity (ibid). With
the advancement of the information technology, the concept mapping software that provides the affordances of
selecting, deleting,  classifying,  sequencing,    modifying,     connecting   and listing   of concept    maps    has  been
developed.  Plotnick  (2001) also   points out   that as  computer-supported       concept   mapping   offers   the ease of
editing, dynamic linking, format conversion, ease of transfer and storing, which are very conducive for learners
to create concept maps. Otherwise, various researchers have been seeking for ways to categorize interactional
patterns in small learning groups, with or without computer supports, through their ethnographic studies on such
learning activities. In Table 1, we compare three relevant studies and a recent effort to synthesize them.

Methodology
Sixty four students from two Grade 6 classes in a primary school were involved in the study. They were taught
in the second unit of the Social Study lesson, !"#$%&'(%#')*+,#-#.,-/*0-#-1%(%#'*-#2*3.4#4(,.*5.',$,',%&6, as
well as taking a competency pre-test on the subject, prior to the study. Students were split into e!"#$% &'('%

Conclusions
Social Studies emphasizes the skills of synthesis and application. The key to the mastery of the subject is to
move away from the conventional "rote learning" and take place with actively engagements in meaningful
learning and knowledge building. In this study, we investigated collaborative concept mapping as a solution to
this issue. Both 1:1 and 1:4 settings were implemented and compared, with the following findings being drawn,
!   L earning outcomes: Our analysis of student performances show that both 1:1 and 1:4 settings had indeed
    been able to improve the students' results and demonstrated good retention. Furthermore, both settings did
    not result in significant differences in the improvement in these two aspects.
!   Results of  concept   mapping:    Although    little difference in  the concept  map   scores between  students
    engaged in the two settings, the standard deviations of the 1:1 groups had been greater than those of the 1:4
    groups. According to our analysis, the underlying reason of the greater differences in the performances
    among the individual 1:1 group members would be that the levels of group bonding had a greater influence
    on the effectiveness of their collaborations.
!   Interactional patterns: We analyzed all the student groups' interactions and discovered that the 1:1 groups
    had practiced four interactional patterns respectivelyB% 0/C2D8B% &!12/D.% =$#2% C*-$% ,*,+D/)% C*12AB% &D2/12).B%

    (the most  popular)   patterns but  not the   other    two. We   argue  that the  1:1 group   had  demonstrated
    interactions of better quality as compared with the 14 groups as the former setting had facilitated greater
    autonomy to individual students, thus enhancing their level of participations in collaborative learning. On
    the other hand, there had been isolated students occurred in some of the 1:4 group, resulting in far-from-
    ideal group interactions.
