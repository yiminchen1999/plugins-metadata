         Abstract:    We described     and  compared     94  pre-service   elementary    teachers'   epistemologies
         during   three different   activities:  one   semi-structured     interview,    an  asynchronous    on-line
         discussion   about   a  physics   problem    and  their  reflection   on   the discussion    of the second
         activity. Using   discourse-based      analysis,  we     analyzed  the  data   in  terms  of  the  teachers'
         underlying    epistemologies      and  findings   revealed     significant differences   across   the three
         activities. This suggests that (a) teachers' epistemologies might be better understood as finer
         grained cognitive resources whose activation is sensitive to the context, unlike most research
         which   views  them     as coherent    and   stable   cognitive  structures,   and  that (b)  the  research
         community is far from settling the debate as to what particular approaches should be used to
         assess  or study    personal   epistemologies.      Depending     on  the  context    and the     manner  of
         investigation, students and teachers may "show" different epistemological understanding.

Introduction
Current  science   education  standards    (NRC,   1996;   2007)     argue  that inquiry    should be    a central strategy of
science  instruction,  partly   because    that inquiry   can   be   a  dynamic     way  for   helping   students  to   develop
sophisticated  understanding     of    the nature   of   science   (NOS)    or   sophisticated    scientific epistemologies.
Epistemology is a term used differently by philosophers and psychologists (Sandoval, 2005). For the purposes
of this paper we take scientific epistemologies to mean the individual's understanding of or views about the
nature  and  characteristics  of   scientific  knowledge     and  its   construction,   including  the   sources  of  scientific
knowledge,   its truth value  and   what   constitutes   scientifically  appropriate    warrants,  and   science  as  a way of
knowing and its values inherited in the development of the scientific knowledge (Abd-El-Khalick & Lederman,
2000; Abd-El-Khalick et al., 1998; Lederman, 1992). The development of sophisticated epistemologies has been
a central component of scientific literacy for some years (AAAS, 1993; NRC, 1996).
         However, this agenda has been slow to become established in instructional practice for a number of
reasons. First, despite a wide consensus for the importance of developing epistemological awareness in science
among learners, the education community has yet to agree on precisely how this awareness is developed, how
epistemological   knowledge     is  developed   and   in what   form    (Louca   et al, 2004).  Most    research  on  personal
epistemologies has assumed they consist of developmental stages or beliefs and thus can be explicitly taught and
developed   (van  Driel et  al., 2001;   Olson,    2007).  Others    have  advocated    a  structure  of   epistemologies   that
consists of units of cognitive structure at a finer grain size than stages or beliefs, suggesting that it is not really a
matter   of developing   new       knowledge    constructs,    but    a matter   of   organizing   a    network    of   existing
epistemological resources (Louca et al, 2004; Hammer & Elby, 2002). Second, there is no consensus regarding
the methodological     approaches   used   to   study students'   epistemologies     (Sandoval,   2005).   One   approach   has
argued that students' epistemologies can be directly investigated, e.g., via interviews (Van Driel et al., 2001). A
second   approach  has  suggested   that   students'  personal    epistemologies    are  manifested   through  practice,  and,
thus, practice is the only way of studying them (Sandoval, 2005; Richardson, 1996). These ambiguities have
resulted in  a rather  fragmented      picture  of students'   epistemologies,      with  often contradicting    findings   and
frequently  students'  practices    of inquiry  appear   to    share much   with    scientific practice  but their   expressed
epistemologies are naïve (Sandoval, 2005).
         Our purpose in this paper was to investigate 94 pre-service elementary teachers' epistemologies while
engaged in three different activities. The differences among these activities refer to the context in which we
investigated their expressed or enacted epistemologies. Firstly, participants were prompted to talk about their
personal epistemologies    during   an   individual   interview.     Secondly,  they    were asked   to  "enact"   science, by
talking about a physics topic on relative motion through an online discussion (without specifically talking about
their personal epistemologies). By enactment, we refer to the participants' efforts to reach a consensus about a
problem related to relative motion. In some cases this involved students trying out experiments and reporting
them to the group or debating various points of view. Thirdly, they were asked to reflect on their enactment of

science during the second activity by debating whether their discussion was scientific or not ­ thus, prompting
them to reflect on the NOS underlying their discussion of relative motion.

Theoretical framework

Current views of NOS
Traditionally,  science   has  been   presented    to students       as a rigid body    of facts, theories,   and   rules to  be
memorized and practiced, rather than a way of knowing about natural phenomena (van Driel et al., 2001). The
learning of correct answers, memorizing of information, rote learning, and reading were central components of
the exploration of questions, critical thought, understanding in context, argument, and doing science. In this
view, teaching science assumed that an already developed body of knowledge, one generally accepted by the
scientific community, could be transmitted to students through passive instructional means (Tobin, Tippins, &
Gallard, 1994).
          To   an increasing  extent   this approach    has     become    the subject   of criticism   among    policy  makers,
teachers, educators, and researchers (e.g., Tobin et al., 1994).          This approach has been related to the decreasing
popularity  of  science among     students  (van    Driel  et   al., 2001). Furthermore,      research on    students' scientific
epistemologies has demonstrated that students exposed to this approach often end up with a poor understanding
of  scientific concepts   (van  Driel  et al., 2001).   Moreover,       science education     in its traditional  form  fails to
adequately prepare future citizens to understand science and technology issues in a rapidly evolving society
(Millar & Osborne, 1998).
          Recently, modern views of NOS suggest that scientific knowledge is (a) tentative (that is, subject to
change), (b) empirically based (that is, testable), (c) subjective (and thus, not absolute), (d) creative, (e) socially
and culturally embedded, (f) unified, (g) amoral, (h) parsimonious (scientific knowledge attempts to achieve a
simplicity of explanation as opposed to complexity), and (i) differentiates between observation and inference
(Abd-El-Khalick, Bell, & Lederman, 1998). In this sense, scientific knowledge is based on observations from
the natural world and reflects human attempts to impose order on the understanding of nature and explain the
mechanism underlying the physical phenomena.
          Reform documents (e.g., AAAS, 1990; NRC, 1996) and researchers (e.g., Lederman, 1992; McComas
& Olson, 1998) have advocated that there are several elements of NOS that should be communicated to students
in  order  for them  to become    scientifically    literate.   Thus,   aspects of  NOS    are   crucial to  guide  the current
assessment of individuals' understandings of NOS, because they are not contentious, they are developmentally
appropriate for K­12 students, they are learnable by K­12 students as indicated by empirical research, and they
are arguably important for all high school graduates to know. Consequently, the objective of helping students
(and teachers for that manner) to develop understandings of NOS is one of the most common objectives for
science education (Abd-El-Khalick, Bell, & Lederman, 1998).

Views about the nature of scientific epistemologies
Disagreements about the tenets of NOS exist at a general level among scientists, science educators, historians
and philosophers of science. Despite these disagreements, there is a widely shared view which suggests that
individuals' epistemologies have a developmental aspect and that these are learnable throughout K-12 (Abd-El-
Khalick & Lederman, 2000). This perspective presents the development of epistemologies as developmental
stages somewhat resembling cognitive development as conceptualized e.g., by Piaget (1967). For instance, in
the seven-stage   scheme   of   King  and   Kitchener   (1994),      children initially view     knowledge   as   comparatively
certain and gained from authority or direct observation. From there they progress to relativist stages in which
they view knowledge as constructed and different viewpoints as valid. Finally, some reach expert stages in
which they see knowledge as constructed yet subject to scrutiny, judgment, and synthesis. Invoking more recent
developmental theorists such as Fischer's (1980), King and Kitchener (2004) adopt a "complex stage theory" in
which a typical subject's epistemology is like a wave spread over two stages.
          A  second  perspective   suggests    that students'      epistemologies   are   not a  unified  whole.   Following   a
growing    set of studies  that suggest   that students'   epistemological      views   of  science   are  not stable  coherent
frameworks, but inconsistent, fragmented and possibly unstable beliefs, this perspective deals separately with
each different    dimension  of  NOS,  such    as,  structure,  certainty   and    source  of knowledge     (Hofer  &  Pintrich,
1997).  It  suggests  that  learners'  epistemologies      along     each   dimension     are assumed     to consist   of semi-
independent beliefs, implying that a student could hold sophisticated views about the structure of e.g., physics
knowledge, seeing it as a hierarchy of concepts rather than a collection of equations, while also holding naïve
beliefs about   the certainty  of that knowledge,     viewing      new    theories as fixed   and absolute.  In   Leach  et al.'s
(2000) study, students' responses to decontextualized and contextualized open-ended survey items that asked
them to reason about the relation between theory and data were found to be inconsistent across the two contexts.
Sandoval   and  Morrison   (2003)  interviewed      a sample    of   high  school  students   before  and   after a month-long
intervention   and  found   that  both  individual    students'      responses  to  different    questions   reflected different

epistemological levels, and that student responses were not stable across interviews (nor predictable). According
to  this perspective,   views   about NOS     consist largely    of  comparatively     stable,  robust    cognitive  structures
corresponding   to articulate,  declarative   knowledge.   These    epistemologies     are taken  to be   the  units of   views
about NOS (Schommer-Aikins, 2004). Some researchers view epistemological beliefs as comparatively global
(Schommer,     1990), while   others  have    investigated  how   epistemological      beliefs vary  by   discipline, e.g., in
chemistry vs. psychology (Hofer, 2002a). What they all agree upon, however, is that epistemologies consist
largely of comparatively stable, robust cognitive structures corresponding to articulate, declarative knowledge.
          Hammer and colleagues (Hammer & Elby, 2002; Louca et al, 2004) have proposed a third perspective,
suggesting that personal epistemologies are made up units of cognitive structure at a finer grain size than stages
or beliefs, which they call resources. Rather than attribute to individuals any general epistemological theories or
beliefs, they understand them to have a range of cognitive resources for understanding scientific knowledge and
its nature. They suggest that the difference between naïve and expert epistemologies lies not just in the content
(views), but also in the form of the relevant cognitive elements. Other studies show that students often hold
inconsistent epistemologies which emerge in different contexts (Hammer, 1994; Roth & Roychoudhury, 1994;
Solomon,    Duveen,   &  Scott, 1994).   There  is  also some    evidence   for    fragmented   epistemologies      from  those
studies that have been unable to assign large portions of students to a single epistemological "type" (Khishfe &
Abd-El-Khalick, 2002; Linn & Songer, 1993). In this sense, a teacher's professed epistemology, for example,
her  stated  views    about knowledge      and   learning,    may    possibly    differ  substantially    from   her  enacted
epistemology, the views about knowledge and learning an observer would infer from her classroom behavior
(Hofer,  2002b;  Tobin   &  McRobbie,     1997), suggesting     that it could   be   a matter  of different   resources   being
activated in different contexts ­ that of an interview and of teaching contexts (e.g., Louca et al., 2004; Leach et.
al, 2000; Roth & Roychoudhury, 1994; diSessa, Elby, & Hammer, 2002).

Novice teachers' epistemologies
A  large  number   of   studies have  indicated  that   teachers'   epistemologies     influence    their teaching   and  their
students'  learning  to a great   extent  (AAAS,    1993;   NRC,     1996). As     a result, researchers   have  investigated
teachers' epistemologies, in addition to developing programs that seek to improve them (e.g., Abell & Smith,
1994; Palmquist & Finley, 1997; Abell et al., 2001). Many of these studies were consistent in showing that
teachers  (both in-service  and   pre-service)  possessed    naive  scientific  epistemologies    (e.g.,  Abd-El-Khalick    &
BouJaoude, 1997).
          Moreover a number of these studies has provided insights about how novice teachers (pre-service and
early-career teachers) encounter teaching and their ability to reflect on practical experience (Penso, Shoman, &
Shiloah,  2001),  how   science   teachers'   views  about   science  and   science    teaching  influence    their classroom
practice (Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992) and how induction programs are essential in addressing the pedagogical
and content needs of science teachers (Luft, Roehrig, & Patterson, 2003). Other studies have documented the
nature and persistence of pre-service teachers' epistemologies. For instance, many pre-service teachers think of
teaching as passing on knowledge, and learning as absorbing and memorizing knowledge (e.g., Calderhead &
Robson, 1991). When they imagine themselves teaching, pre-service teachers often picture themselves standing
in front of a group of attentive students presenting information, going over problems and giving explanations. A
significant proportion   of teachers  believe   that  scientific knowledge      is not  tentative,  and   hold a positivistic,
idealistic view of science (Lederman, 1992).

The relationship between teachers' views of NOS and classroom practice
Research    concerning    improving    teachers'    epistemologies      has followed       the assumption      that  teachers'
epistemologies directly transfer into their classroom practices (Lederman, 1992). In other words, it is assumed
that studying teacher practices can help understand their epistemologies (Sandoval, 2005), and that improving
teachers' epistemologies is sufficient for promoting "effective" NOS instruction in science (Lederman, 1992).
          However, through a range of studies, it is currently understood that the relationship between teachers'
epistemologies and their classroom practice is more complex than originally assumed. Several factors have been
identified  to mediate  and   constrain   the translation  of   teachers'   epistemologies     into practice.  These   factors
include  pressure  to cover   content (Abd-El-Khalick      et al.,  1988;   Hodson     1993),  classroom    management     and
organizational principles (Hodson, 1993), concerns for student abilities and motivation (Brickhouse & Bodner
1992; Lederman, 1999), institutional constraints (Brickhouse & Bodner, 1992), teaching experience (Lederman,
1999), discomfort with understandings of NOS, and the lack of resources and experiences for assessing student
epistemologies (Abd-El-Khalick et al., 1998).
          Research   on the translation    of teachers'  epistemologies     into classroom     practice   indicates  that even
though   these can  be  thought   of  as a necessary    condition   for promoting      the development     of  students'  NOS
understanding, these epistemologies should not be considered sufficient (Lederman 1992). This may suggest
that research   efforts should   concentrate   beyond    simply     identifying  teachers'   professed    epistemologies,   to
investigating  their  translation into   enacting   (or  practical)  epistemologies     as   they  appear   during   everyday

teaching. By teachers' practical epistemology we refer to the set of epistemologies about ones' own knowledge
production   in  school science,   including  what   knowledge     is, the methods    through  which   knowledge  can  be
produced,  and   the  criteria for  evaluating   knowledge    claims,  which  are   reflected in the  epistemic decisions
people make during the construction and evaluation of scientific knowledge (Sandoval, 2005).
         All these issues raise three questions about teachers' scientific epistemologies and their development.
First, the nature of epistemologies remains somewhat unclear; whether epistemologies are organized in coherent
frameworks, or are fragmented beliefs or finer-grain resources. Second, the specific epistemologies that guide
teachers'  practices  are  largely  unknown.   Third,   the   relation of  these practical  epistemologies  and  teachers'
expressed epistemologies are not well articulated. Given the discrepancy between what teachers seem able to do
and the difficulty they have in articulating epistemological aspects of formal science, it seems more likely that
epistemological beliefs are contextualized rather than coherent frameworks (Hammer & Elby, 2002).
         Our purpose in this paper is to contribute specifically to these needs: to investigate teachers' expressed
and practical epistemologies through multiple data sources. The differences among these data sources refer to
the context  in  which  we    investigated their expressed    or  enacted  epistemologies.    Thus, we  compare   94  pre-
service  teachers'  expressed   epistemologies    as revealed     through  an interview,   their practical epistemologies
underlying a discussion about relative motion, and their epistemologies underlying a reflective discussion about
whether their science enactment in the relative motion discussion was scientific or not.

Methodology
The present study was interpretive in nature and focused on the epistemologies that participants held, expressed
or  underlay  their   actions  in  the three  aforementioned      tasks.  Ninety-four  pre-service   elementary  teachers
participated  in this  study.  All  participants were   enrolled  in   a science methods    course  in the same  semester
(separated in two groups), taught by the first author. The data collection took place at the very beginning of the
course (during the first three weeks), prior to any intervention and discussion about NOS characteristics.
         Data sources consisted of three different activities. For the first activity we randomly selected 47 out of
the 94 pre-service teachers of the study, whom we interviewed individually about their views concerning NOS.
All interviews were conducted by the second author, using a semi-structured protocol which focused on three
areas, namely, demographics, views about science and about teaching science. The first part of the interview
focused on identifying pre-service teachers' experiences with science from both pre-university and university
studies. The second part of the interview aimed at identifying pre-service teachers' epistemologies (for instance,
we asked them what is Science for them; under what conditions is something scientific; and what does the term
"experiment"    mean   to  them).  The  third part of  the  interview    focused  on  investigating pre-service  teachers'
views about science teaching. For instance, we asked them what they thought the goal of Science education is;
about the role of a teacher during a science lesson; and what they thought the components of a "good" science
lesson are. Finally, interviewees watched a short video clip from a science lesson and were asked to comment
about  the ways   they  might   respond   to students'  ideas    and reasoning,  had  they  been  the  teacher during this
lesson.
         For the second activity, all 94 teachers had an online, asynchronous threaded discussion about relative
motion. We randomly assigned pre-service teachers into groups of 10 or 11 participants and provided them with
a question on relative motion: A person is running, holding a set of keys in her hand, which she holds still next
to her  body. What    would    happen  to the  keys, if she   let go,  while  still running?  We  asked  each  pre-service
teacher to have at least one posting of her own answer to the question, respond to at least three other group-
mates' answers, respond to all the comments she received for her own postings, including her answer to the
initial question, in an effort to reach consensus about the answer to the question, after discussing this with the
rest of the members of her group. The pre-service teachers had a week in which to reach a consensus. A total of
341 posts were made by the 94 teachers which reflected an average of 80 words per post, and all groups of
students  were   close to, or  reached  consensus.   The   third  activity was   also an online,  asynchronous   threaded
discussion, carried out by the same groups of pre-service teachers as above. This occurred immediately after the
second activity and also lasted for a week. In this activity, pre-service teachers had to reflect on the discussions
they had during the second activity, in an attempt to discover whether that discussion was scientific or not. A
total of 359 posts were made by the 94 teachers, which reflected an average of 105 words per post.
         All interviews were transcribed and along with all threaded discussions served as the primary sources
of data. We analyzed all data using a discourse-based analysis focusing on three particular aspects of NOS: (a)
what is science (b) what is the result of science and (c) what is scientific knowledge? Categories for this analysis
were drawn from the literature we have described in the theoretical framework of the paper. Some categories
identified in the literature were not observed in our data and thus are not part of our coding scheme. The final
categories that we used for each aspect of NOS were organized in an ordinal scale based on their sophistication.
Each   teacher's  postings  for   a particular   discussion   were   analyzed    separately  and  coded  in terms  of  the
underlying ideas about the three aspects of NOS. The same was done with each participant's interview. In all
cases, each teacher's postings or interview was assigned with only one code for each of the three aspects of the

NOS. All codings were carried out independently by the first and the second author (Cohen's Kappa=0,84), and
differences were resolved through discussion.
        We    used descriptive  statistics to    compare teachers'  views   about the  result of science,  science as a
process and the scientific knowledge from the three different contexts. Lastly, the non-parametric Wilcoxon
Signed-Rank Test was applied to test for significant differences in teachers' views among the three data sources
(contexts). The test was applied only to the 47 pre-service teachers from whom we had data from all three
contexts.

Findings
Findings revealed considerable differences among teachers' epistemologies about NOS in the three contexts (see
Table 1). Activity  1 will  be  referred   to  as "interview,"  activity 2  as  "enacting science"  and   activity 3  as
"reflection."

Pre-service teachers' epistemologies related to what is science
When "enacting science" most of the pre-service teachers (83.9%) felt that the result of science consists of a
number of laws that govern the physical world. This idea appeared less often in the interviews (5.7%) and in the
reflections (8.6%). During the interviews, pre-service teachers suggested that science improves quality of life
(14.3%)   and provides answers   to questions     about  physical  phenomena    (20.0%);  these   ideas did  not appear
during the two online discussions. During the interview and the reflection, the majority of the teachers felt that
scientific knowledge is an interpretation of everyday physical phenomena (60% and 90.6%, respectively), an
idea which did not appear as often when teachers enacted science (15.7%).

Pre-service teachers' epistemologies related to what is the result of science
During the interviews, pre-service teachers described science as a process of observation and experimentation
(45.7%). Similarly, this idea appeared in teachers' reflections (43.2%), while only 17.6% of the pre-service
teachers seemed to use this idea while enacting science. When enacting science, most of the pre-service teachers
(82.4%) seemed to view science as the process of investigating, accepting or rejecting theories. However, during
their reflection and the interview, only about half of the pre-service teachers (56.8% and 54.3%, respectively)
seemed to view science as such. The other half (43.2% and 45.7%, respectively) viewed science as a process of
observation   and experimentation.  None      of the teachers  appeared  to see science as    a process of memorizing
scientific facts during the three activities.

individual understands the truth about the physical world, whereas, during the reflection fewer teachers (47.1%)

seemed   to understand  scientific knowledge    as   the most   commonly     accepted  answers   to  questions about   the
physical world. During the interview more than half of the teachers (54.3%) indicated that scientific knowledge
is what we learn from doing experiments. This idea appeared less during the rest of the activities.            Moreover,
during the interview 20,0% of the teachers seemed to understand scientific knowledge as absolutely true, but
less seemed to do so during their reflections (10.5%) and even less when they enacted science (5.3%). Similarly,
during their interviews 14.3% of the pre-service teachers      described scientific knowledge as a "truth" that might
change in the future, an idea observed much less during the enactment of science (4.1%) and the reflection
(2.5%).

Comparison of pre-service teachers epistemologies across the three contexts
Overall, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test indicated that the pre-service teachers' epistemologies for each of the
three aspects of NOS investigated were statistically significantly different across the three contexts. Specifically,
the pre-service  teachers'   epistemologies   about  the  result  of  science  differed  significantly   among   all three
contexts  (p<0,001  across all  comparisons).   In terms    of what   science is, pre-service  teachers'  epistemologies
during  the interview  and the   reflection were  not   found  to differ  significantly, but both   were  found  to  differ
significantly from  the  enacting     science  activity  (p<0,001    across  all  comparisons).   Finally,   the findings
concerning what scientific knowledge is, revealed that all the contexts were significantly different (p< 0,001
across all comparisons).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate and describe pre-service teachers' epistemologies from three different
data sources reflecting three different contexts. Findings revealed statistically significant differences of the pre-
service teachers' epistemologies among the three contexts investigated, which raises two issues.
          The first issue is related with the nature and/or the development of epistemological understanding. Our
findings,  along with  a number    of  other   studies  (Hammer,     1994;   Roth  &  Roychoudhury,      1994;   Solomon,
Duveen, & Scott, 1994; Hammer & Elby, 2002; Louca et al, 2004) contend that personal epistemologies seem to
be better understood as fine-grain cognitive structures that are activated depending on the context in which the
activation takes place. Asking teachers about their views of NOS or inferring those views from their enactment
in science or their reflections seem to invoke statistically different epistemological resources, which they use to
explain, understand or respond to a particular situation.
          The fact that the differences among the three contexts are not similar in terms of the three areas of NOS
that we have investigated (what is science, what is the result of science and what is scientific knowledge), has
another  important  implication. It   suggests  that viewing   personal   epistemologies    as semi-independent    beliefs
(Hofer   &   Pintrich,  1997;   Schommer-Aikins,        2004)   cannot    explain    these  differences.  The    teachers'
epistemologies investigated in this study, differ among the three contexts, but the differences in the three areas
of NOS investigated are not similar among the three contexts. Teachers' epistemologies are not only different
across contexts, but there is also a variation of those differences within the various contexts. For instance, pre-
service  teachers' views   about   science  as  a process   are   similar between    the   interview  and the  reflection.
However,    the  same  teachers' views   about  the  nature    of scientific knowledge     are statistically significantly
different in the two contexts. Thus, we suggest that our findings indicate that even within a particular area of
NOS,   the  same  pre-service  teachers  hold  multiple  epistemological     resources,  which  they  activate   based on
context. Thus, attributing robust epistemologies developed into coherent theories (McComas, 1996; Sandoval &
Morrison, 2003) to pre-service elementary teachers is definitely inappropriate.
          The second   issue is related to  the debate   that  exists in  literature about  the approaches    of studying
personal epistemologies (Sandoval, 2005). Assessments of formal science tend to ask students to express their
views about the nature of scientific knowledge and activity, including questions about what scientists do, what
theories are, how theories and experimentation influence each other and so forth. The general picture from such
studies is  that students' ideas   about   formal  science   follow   a  developmental     trajectory toward   increasing
sophistication throughout adolescence (e.g., Leach et al., 1997), but tend to remain fairly naïve even during
university instruction. Our findings show a similar picture, which we feel suggests that the research community
is far from settling the debate as to which particular approaches should be used to assess or study personal
epistemologies. Depending on the context and the manner of investigation, students and teachers may "show"
different epistemological understanding. One suggestion is that, the research community may choose to follow a
multiple-data-source approach when studying personal epistemologies.
          Finally, disagreeing with the suggestion that it is an academic issue whether teachers' epistemologies
are necessarily  reflected in   their classroom   practice  (Lederman,    1999),   an implication    stemming    from  our
findings is that methodological effects might be possible. The ideas teachers express, explicitly or implicitly,
may differ depending on the situation in which they are engaged. For example in the context of an interview,
teachers may report views they believe they hold, whereas when they enact science, or reflect back on their
enactment   they may   reveal "alternative"   views. In  the   interview  context, the  teachers self-report  views   they

                                                     38   ·  © ISLS

think they hold about an issue, which are often influenced by social desirability. While enacting science their
conceptions will be interpreted by independent coders and are possibly influenced, not only by what they have
been  taught about  science,  but  also  by their experience    with science  in formal  informal  learning contexts.
Consequently, we propose that a broader account of personal epistemologies should include investigations with
methods that are not limited to questionnaire surveys and interviewing.
