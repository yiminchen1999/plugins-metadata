 Validation of a Learning Progression: Relating Empirical Data to
                                                      Theory
         A bst r act : Learning   progressions  (LPs) are   theoretical models of   learning trajectories  in  a
         domain. Recent policy reports have touted LPs as a promising approach to align standards,
         curriculum, and assessment. However, the scholarship on LPs is sparse, and the jury is still
         out on the theoretical and practical value of this approach. To realize any potential of LPs we
         need to systematically validate and refine these hypothetical models in real-world contexts.
         Such validation efforts are challenging, as they require the coordination of messy empirical
         data with, often, under-specified theoretical models. In this paper we report on our efforts to
         validate a genetics LP through a two-year longitudinal study in middle school. We describe
         how we used interview data to refine the hypothesized levels of progression in our LP and to
         identify contingencies between constructs (big ideas) within our LP. We conclude with some
         tentative heuristics for coordinating data and LP models.

Introduction
Recently   there has    been   a resurgence  of  interest in   learning progressions  (LPs)    - a theoretically  driven
pedagogical  approach     that  emphasizes  the  learning   of big ideas  and practices, in  a   domain, over  extended
periods of time (Author et al., 2009a; Lehrer & Schauble, 2009). Advocated by policy reports as means to align
standards, curriculum, and assessment, LPs have the potential to be a transformative new approach to science
education reform (e.g. NRC, 2007). However, the scholarship about LPs is still in its infancy and extensive
validation efforts are needed to move this scholarship forward and ascertain the theoretical soundness of LPs
and practicality of using them in the science classroom.
         LPs    are theoretical  models  of learning  in  a  domain   that describe progressively   more   sophisticated
levels of reasoning that a learner exhibits as she develops expertise (NRC, 2007). These progressions describe
learning as it unfolds over extended periods of time (grades and grade bands). LPs are not developmentally
inevitable but require targeted instruction and curriculum. Most importantly, LPs are hypothetical constructs;
and while they are grounded in research in student learning, to the extent possible, they do require validation.
Existing examples of progressions vary in the number, and hence grain size, of the levels they postulate (e.g.
Author  et al.,  2008;   Schwarz   et al., 2009; Songer,     Kelsey   & Gotwals, 2009).  These     differences raise the
question of what is a useful grain size for LPs? Too many levels and it is difficult to generalize (you loose the
forest for  all  the   trees), too few  levels  and  one   looses  explanatory  power    (Lehrer   & Schauble,    2009).
Determining the appropriate number of levels is not merely a theoretical exercise; it also entails empirical tests

       LPs also differ in the number of big ideas or constructs they encompass, and in the ways in which
progress along one construct is related (or not) to progress along other constructs. Wilson (2009) described
different assessment structures of LPs that exemplified distinct types of relationships between constructs. For
example, progress along two constructs may occur independently in a parallel structure, or constructs may be
linked such that progress along one construct may only begin after the attainment of some level of sophistication
on another. Establishing the existence of such links is an important part of the LP validation process. Like the
validation of the number of levels in an LP, the validation of links between constructs presents both theoretical
and methodological challenges. In this paper we describe out efforts to address the challenge of validating an
LP, and  coordinating    between    the hypothetical  model    and  empirical data, in the   context of  a genetics  LP
previously described (Author et al., 2009a). We describe how we refined the number of levels (for a construct in
our LP) and how we identified contingencies, or links, between levels of two constructs within the LP.
         Here we will focus on two constructs within this eight construct LP and describe the progression along
these constructs as hypothesized in the LP. We chose to focus on these constructs as they are core ideas
molecular genetics that are often underrepresented in middle school curricula, and therefore students had a wide
array of understandings about these ideas (providing a fruitful context for our validation efforts). The first
construct (construct B of our LP) concerns the nature of the genetic information. Genes are essentially
instructions that encode the order and type of building blocks of proteins. While the outcomes of genes have far
reaching effects, the information itself mostly specifies the structure of one, very important, biological molecule
- the protein (Author et al., 2009a). The second construct (construct C of our LP) focuses on the idea that
proteins act as the intermediary between genes and traits and are required for the functioning of all organisms
(Author et al., 2009a). These molecules have many biological functions such as catalyzing chemical reactions,
building channels, structural support, relaying messages within cells, among other functions. Understanding the
link between genes and proteins, and the role of proteins in biological traits is at the core of molecular genetics.

Table 1 illustrates the levels of knowledge to be reached by students at the specified grades. We explain the
hypothetical progression for these constructs in more detail in the results and discussion section.

Methods

Study Context
The data analyzed in this paper was collected as part of a two-year longitudinal study designed to empirically
test the genetics learning progression described by Author et al. (2008). Due to logistical concerns, 8th graders
were used as a proxy for high school students. In order to validate the progression we instantiated it within two
instructional units. These units were project-based, where students investigated three genetic diseases in the first
unit and focused   on   a genetic engineering  problem    in  the  second unit.   These  units were developed    by  a
collaborative design team of educational researchers and teachers.     The units were implemented by of one of the
teachers on the design team in her mixed grade classroom (6th, 7th, and 8th grade students) in a small urban,
public K-8 charter school. The school has a total of 234 students (with 59 6-8th grade students in the study) with
a large proportion of minority students and about 35% of the students eligible for free or reduced lunch.

Data Collected
Four types of data were collected: (a) pre and post written assessments, (b) artifacts of student work (including a
performance assessment),    (c) individual pre  and   post  clinical  interviews, and (d) video   tapes of  classroom
instruction and group work. For this paper we discuss the collection and analysis of the clinical interviews only.
We conducted pre and post interviews during the first year of the study (before and after implementation of the
first unit); and a second round of post interviews were conducted at the end of the implementation of the second
unit. The interviewed students (N=24) were selected by the teacher to offer the most representative sample of
students from the study classrooms (Total N=60).
         Interviews included three open-ended tasks that all provided opportunities for students to discuss their
understanding of how genes bring about their effects and the role of proteins in genetic phenomena. In the first
task students were asked to reason about the inheritance of a genetic disorder based on a family pedigree and to
speculate about the molecular mechanism underlying this disorder. Part of this task specifically focused on how
students used  ideas  about  genes  and  proteins  to  formulate   explanations   of the mechanism    of the   genetic
disorder. The second task, involving a genetic trait in bacteria (chemotaxis), prompted students to provide a
hypothetical explanation, at the cellular level, how bacteria can sense substances in their environment. As well
as to speculate about cellular mechanisms that could render mutated bacteria unable to sense (Author et al.,
2007). In the final task we asked students for specific definitions of genetic terminology such as gene, protein,
DNA, and chromosome. In this task we also prompted students to share their ideas about how these entities are
related to one another.

Data Analysis
In this paper, we report our analysis of the second round of post interviews. We chose this set of interviews
because it exemplified the largest variation in student ideas and represented multiple levels of understandings in
the domain. This variation in student ideas provides a suitable context for examining the different levels of
sophistication and any    relationships between   ideas  in  distinct constructs  in the progression.   All interview
transcripts were blinded for analysis. As noted earlier, we will discuss students' understandings of constructs B
and C in the progression, which pertain to the molecular model.

two constructs in the progression. The expected levels of sophistication, as detailed in the progression, informed
the initial coding schemes. Through an iterative process these initial coding schemes were refined to capture
relevant variation in the data. Within the first construct, several levels of sophistication were identified and they
ranged from identifying genes as passive particles associated with traits, to the most sophisticated level of
understanding-    the cellular mechanism      by  which    genes   code   for  proteins. Similarly, several  levels  of
sophistication were observed for the second construct, ranging from a vitalistic view of proteins (a general
notion of proteins as important to vitality and health) to a view of proteins as having specific functions that
mediate genetic effects in an organism. We also determined the number of student responses associated with
each level of sophistication for both constructs.
        Another aspect of analysis was to determine dependencies, or links, between the two constructs; we
characterized the ways in which students connected ideas relating to the two constructs. For this analysis we
examined the interview as a whole and looked for evidence of connections between ideas in the two constructs.
We created individual profiles for each student that described the extent to which the constructs were linked. We
were able to triangulate our findings by referring back to two previously coded aspects of the first interview
task: how gene mutations affect protein function and how students organized ideas about genes and proteins.
Referring to this  analysis  provided   supporting  evidence    for the  contingencies   determined  between    the two
constructs. Inter-rater reliability for these two aspects was 91%.

Results and Discussion

Refining the Levels of a Learning Progression
One of the major difficulties with validating LPs is mapping the theoretical framework onto empirical findings.
In our analyses   we   found   several levels of  understanding     that had   not been  captured by   the hypothetical
progression. This was particularly prominent in our analysis of Construct B, which deals with the nature of the
genetic information.   At the lower anchor of the progression for construct B are non-information based views of
the genetic material, namely, genes as passive particles associated with traits. As a result of instruction students
are expected to develop information-based views of genes at various levels of sophistication. According to the
progression  students  move    from a  view   of  genes   as   instructions Dfor how  organisms   grow,    develop, and
#.&($0"&E;'6.$'20$3".$'*'&"$0"&'"#'C%&%+'*+'("/0&C'D%>().+07%)=E' #",'<,"$%0&+'!)%7%)'F'"#'$3%'<,"C,%++0"&1;'$"'*'
view of genes as productive instructions for protein molecules that perform tasks within cells (level 2), and
finally to a view of genes as instructions that encode for the order and type of amino acids in a protein (level 3)
(Author et  al., 2009a,  p.660). Our   data   did reflect  the existence    of these levels. However,  we   also found
evidence for other student+: ideas and levels of understandings that were not previously captured in the LP.
        Thus the data allowed us to refine the construct map regarding idea B in the following ways. First,
while the instructional units mapped onto levels 2 and 3 of the progression, we found that students in our study
entered the progression with understandings that were below a level 1. The progression at a level 2 anticipates
that students will already have an information-based view of genes (essentially level 1 of the LP is getting to
this understanding). What we found is that 23 of the 24 students were at a level 0 (non-information based view
of genes) upon entering the study and only 1 student still held this view at the end. Given that students did not
receive any genetics instruction prior to the study, this finding is not surprising. However, it does underscore the
importance of moving students from a non-information based view of genes to an information-based view of
genes as a precursor to any of the more sophisticated understandings regarding gene function.
        Second, we found that many students struggled with the transition to an information-based view of
genes, and   that there  seems   to be   an intermediate     level  of   understanding,  not  captured by   the  current
progression, that instantiates this transitional understanding (genes as active information). Students who held

is information based, but no translation is required between the genetic information and a physical entity, as the
gene itself directs the function. For example, in the case of a genetically inherited blood clotting disorder, Barry
claimed that D[the genes are] giving instructions for uh, to tell the cell, to tell the cell what to doE8 When we
identified this transitory level of understanding we had to decide whether it was sufficiently distinct from other
levels of understanding to merit inclusion, as its own level, in the progression. Given that the transition from the
non-information based to an information-based view of genes is a particularly challenging one (Author et al.,
2007; Venville & Treagust, 1998) we decided that capturing this understanding as a distinct level was merited
for two reasons. First, cognitively this understanding reflect+'*&'"&$")"C0(*)'+30#$'0&'+$./%&$+:'.&/%,+$*&/0&C+'"#'
genes, in essence the beginning of an important conceptual change. Second, and following from the first, it is
pertinent that teachers (and curriculum/assessment designers) recognize this understanding as bridging across
ontologies and leverage it in their instruction.
        We also found that there were variations in the ideas that fell within level 1 of the progression (genes
as information for growth and development). At this level of the progression, students tend to assume that genes

                                                    534   ·  © ISLS

can code for multiple biological entities (and functions) such as cells, tissues, organ functions, and whole traits.
While students may include proteins as one of the many things genes code for, they usually do not view proteins
as the predominant product of the genetic instructions. We found that some of the students in our study included
only proteins and cells as entities specified by the genetic information. We initially thought of separating this
understanding out into its own level, as thinking at the cellular level seemed more sophisticated than thinking at
the tissue or organism level. However, we decided against this because our sense was that students tended to
map the genetic information onto the lowest level of organization they were familiar with, for some students this
was organs, for others cells. Making a distinction between these ideas did not seem like a true representation of
+$./%&$+:'A&"2)%/C%' "#'C%&%+;'6.$',*$3%,'$3%0,'A&"2)%/C%' "#'60")"C0(*)'",C*&0B*$0"&')evels. Moreover, we felt
that this understanding tended to be context dependent such that a student may map the genetic information onto
cells in one context and onto organs in another.
                        Table 2 illustrates our data-driven refinements of construct B. Overall, we found that 6 of the students
were able to reach level 2 of construct B of the progression. There were 5 students still at level 1 and 9 students
were at the new transitory level between levels 1 and 2 of the progression. Very few students were able to reach
level 3 of the LP (4 students total), and even for those who did express a level 3 understanding it was not as
robust as we had hoped.

                        We now turn to our findings regarding construct C of the LP, which involves the understanding that
proteins have a central role in organism function and are essentially the link between the genetic information
(genotype) and the resulting physical trait (phenotype) (Author et al., 2009a). Again, three levels were defined
in the hypothetical LP. The first level involves a non-protein based understanding of biological phenomena
whereby proteins are not yet central to biological function (and may not be mentioned by students) however,
students are able to reason about biological organization levels and in particular cells as the building blocks of
life and as                 having specific functions within tissues and organs (see Table 3). Level 2 of the progression
anticipates a protein-based view of biological function; at this level students should be able to explain biological
phenomena by invoking proteins as central players, and be able to propose specific functions for those proteins
in cells and tissues. Finally, by the end of the LP (level 3) students are expected to understand that that proteins

able to reason about the ways in which changes to the genetic code (mutations) can affect the structure and thus

                        For this construct, we analyzed the interviews and identified three distinct levels of sophistication that
students exhibited with respect to proteins (see Table 3).                 In the first level students had vitalistic notions of
proteins and considered proteins as solely providing positive health benefits for the body. For example, Alyssa

                                                                  535  ·  © ISLS

proteins are necessary. These students also explained that without proteins negative health affects would ensue,
that is, they realized that proteins have an important biological role and that there are consequences to
interfering with protein function. This level was not captured by our hypothetical LP, but is considered to be
below level 2 of the hypothetical LP in terms of sophistication. In the next level students explicitly described
proteins as central to genetic phenomena but were unable to provide any contextual examples, which

as an explanatory element of the genetic phenomena. That is, these students knew that if a phenomenon is
genetic, it must involve proteins. However, they struggled to apply this schema in context and provide specific
examples of protein involvement. For example, when presented with a reasoning task concerning an inherited
genetic disorder, Daniel immediately discussed inheritance of genes from family members. He also agreed that
proteins are involved in the genetic disorder, but when prompted to give an explanation of this he responds that

proteins are involved in the genetic phenomena but cannot provide examples beyond his acknowledgment of
their presence. In the final level students could instantiate their ideas about proteins as related to genetic
phenomena by providing specific examples of protein functions and how a genetic mutation might affect protein
function (corresponding to level 3 of the LP).
                       Table 3 illustrates our data-driven refinements for construct C. We did not have any students at a level
1 of the hypothetical progression by the end of the two units. However, we did have evidence from earlier
interviews that a non-protein based view of genetic phenomena exists. We found that 12 students remained at
level 1.5 of the refined construct C. Several students (8 total) were able to reach a level 2 understanding where
some could provide contextual examples, while others could not (suggesting this level could be split further).
Very few students (4 total) were able to reach level 3 of the refined construct C and could reason about amino
acids as building blocks for proteins. Again, as with construct B, their ideas about proteins were not as robust as
we had hoped.

Identifying Connections and Contingencies between the Constructs
The                 theoretical LP in genetics  did not include    any  hypotheses    regarding  links or dependencies    between
constructs, there was simply not enough evidence in the literature to support such assertions. Our second goal
for this analysis was to ascertain the ways in which understandings along constructs B and C might be related,
or dependent upon each other. From a canonical point of view these constructs must be related as construct B
essentially               defines  what biological  entity the  genetic   information specifies  (genes  code for proteins),   and

                                                                 536  ·  © ISLS

construct C defines the role of proteins in genetic phenomena (the idea that proteins bring about the phenotype).
However, it is not clear whether these understandings develop in parallel, or whether a student needs to attain a
certain level of sophistication for construct B in order to reason at particular levels for construct C (or vice
versa). Towards this end  we tried to map out the connections between these constructs as manifested                                                in students
thinking.  Overall, we found that                                              students had difficulty drawing a relationship between genes and proteins and
thus these constructs seemed to exist (and to some extent develop) in parallel.
          We found that for 8 of the students there did not seem to be any connection at all between genes and
proteins (see Figure 1 L light shading). There were 11 students that demonstrated understandings that suggested
a weak link between these constructs, a sort of touch-and-go connection, in which the extent of linkage varied
with the task context (see Figure 1 L medium shading). Only 5 students expressed understandings that suggested
fairly stable and  robust connections                                               between  the   constructs. Figure 1 further illustrates the distribution of

connections between these constructs. For these students, the constructs seemed intertwined and they were able

intertwined understandings, Amy also held a level 6 understanding for construct B (genes encode for amino
acids which provide structure and function for proteins), and a level 3 understanding for construct C (proteins as
central to genetic phenomena                                                 with contextual explanations).    However  her understanding    of the connection
between genes and proteins was not as straight forward. It is also possible that she held a higher level of
understanding but did not provide evidence of this in her interview. For example, in the following exchange,
Amy was asked to reason about a genetically inherited blood clotting disorder:

   Interviewer:     Now do you think proteins have anything to do with this?
   Amy:             Mmm hmm (agrees)
   Interviewer:     Okay, what do you think proteins are doing?
   Amy:             Um, I think the proteins that should be doing its job is, has to um, has to send a
                    message to the cells to like, um, to um, to duplicate their cells and um close the, close

   Interviewer:     Okay, very good. What about genes? Do genes have anything to do with this?
   Amy:             Mmm hmm (agrees)
   Interviewer:     Okay how do genes work?

                    something.

          In this example, Amy provides intertwined understandings of the two constructs. She is able to define
the role of the protein (causing the cell to undergo mitosis and close the cut) and the role of the gene (to provide

         An understanding of the role of protein structure and function in genetic phenomena was critical for
students to fully explain how genes and proteins are related to one another. This was also reflected in the other
two categories of relationships between the constructs (no link, and weak link). If students were at a level 2 on
construct C (proteins as central to genetic phenomena without specific contextual examples), they were limited
to providing only specific touch-and-go connections between genes and proteins. For example, Kaitlyn (at a
level 2 for construct C and level 3 for construct B) was asked how genes and proteins are involved in an
inherited skin elasticity disorder:

  Kaitlyn:       I think it has to do with that their body is not making that protein.
  Interviewer:   OA*=;'23='0+&:$'$3%0,'6"/='-*A0&C'$3*$'<,"$%0&P
  Kaitlyn:       Maybe because there is a mutation in the code or something.
  Interviewer:   So why would a mutation in the code prevent them from making a protein?
  Kaitlyn:       Because it:s messing everything up and not letting it do its job.
  Interviewer:   So the mutation is messing up the protein?
  Kaitlyn:       Mmm hmm (agrees)
  Interviewer:   So the prot%0&'(*&:$'/"'0$+'R"68'@3*$'/"'2%'$30&A'$3%'R"6'"#'$3%'<,"$%0&'-0C3$'6%'3%,%P

         In this example, Kaitlyn was unable to explain the link between a change to the gene and a resultant

This example illustrates the incomplete explanations students generate when they only have weakly connected
knowledge of the two constructs.
         The strength of the linkage was reflected in the level to which they progressed for each construct. For
example students reaching level 3 on construct B and a level 2 on construct C (the lowest score possible for
linkage) held weaker associations between genes and proteins than a student reaching a level 5 on construct B
and a level 2 on construct C. There were several students (8 total) who did not demonstrate any understandings
that genes and proteins are related, and this was symptomatic of their understanding of proteins. These students
tended to view proteins as vitalistic or being required to maintain optimal health; these views of proteins were
paired with views of genes as non-informational or, at most, as active information (level 3 of refined construct
B). Two of these students held a level 5 understanding of genes in construct B (genes as information for
proteins), but only  a level 1.5    understanding of proteins  in  construct C (proteins as required   for optimum
health). In these cases, the students both viewed genes as providing information to make proteins, yet at the
same time did not view proteins as central to the genetic phenomena (described proteins as required for health
and vitalistic). This is unique, since other students who held a similar level 5 understanding for construct B, had
at least a level 2 (or higher) understanding for construct C (proteins as central without contextual examples).
This suggests that high levels of sophistication for construct B do not necessarily bootstrap connections between
the two constructs.
         By analyzing the relationships between two constructs within our LP we were able to determine that

students were   able to describe    genes in terms   of genetic inheritance   quite accurately (relate genotype    to
phenotype), but it was not until they viewed proteins as central to genetic phenomena that linkages between
ideas about genes and proteins could be made. Based on our data we can both revise these two constructs within
our LP   and describe  the ways     in which development     along one  construct depends,  or is dependent   upon,
development along another.

Conclusions and Implications
We, like others, are cautiously optimistic about the potential of LPs to inform instruction, curriculum and
assessment (Author et al., 2009b; Lehrer & Schauble,     2009; NRC, 2005; NRC 2007).     Their potential can only
be realized if we can effectively validate and revise them based on empirical findings. Such validation efforts
are challenging given the messy, and context dependent, nature of the data.    In this paper we presented our
efforts to use our empirical findings to inform revisions for a theoretical LP in genetics. Based on this research
we next provide a few heuristics and suggestions for the process of refining LPs in relation to data.
         Levels should be added (or split) when the ideas inherent to the new level are directly related to the
construct and offer explanatory power (in terms of student cognition) or instructional leverage. In the case of
our refinement of construct B (Table 2) we added the transition level because it highlighted the initial step of
conceptual change. This new level provides explanatory power in terms of modeling conceptual change and is

                                                    538  ·  © ISLS

an instructional leverage in the sense that it can be a bridging understanding from a non-information based view
of genes to one that is information-based. We did not, however, include a new level to capture students:'0/%*+'
that genes have information about cells, despite their existence in the data set. This new idea was not directly
relevant to the construct as it reflected an understanding of biological organization levels rather than notions
about genetic information per se.
        While we did not have to consolidate or remove levels based on our data, our sense is that such a move
would be necessary if there are no cases, in the data set, of the specific level of understanding, and the level
provided little explanatory power in terms of predicting student performance or modeling student cognition.
Given that starting point for the LP included only three levels, it was unlikely that we would need to remove any
levels. It was the case that we observed very few data points for level 3 understandings, however, we do see this
is reason to remove the upper target of the progression. It does, however, suggest ways in which we would need
to revise our instructional materials in order to move more students along the progression.
        It is very likely, given the complex nature of learning, that movement along one or more constructs in a

2009). In order to identifying such links or dependencies between levels across multiple constructs it is

level of understanding in each. Such a representation allowed us to see the constraints and affordances that
different levels of understandings have in relation to other constructs. In this paper we conducted the analysis
for two constructs. Adding more constructs to the mix will certainly present a challenge, but we believe that a
similar approach could be used with larger numbers of constructs at play.
        We anticipate that our revisions to the genetics LP will be a first step in a series of refinement and
revision cycles. In future studies we also intend to vary the curriculum in order to begin to tease apart aspects of
student thinking and learning that seem curriculum dependent. This is another challenge in validating the LP
approach and much additional work is needed in order to develop our understanding of the relationship between
LPs and the instructional context.
