     Abstract. To reduce the risk of failure when implementing an innovation, understanding factors
     that may influence users' intention to use a system should be obtained before the system is
     implemented.      This study proposed and tested       a pre-implementation technology acceptance
     model. This model may help change agents to evaluate the feasibility of the innovation and to
     identify the key factors that may determine the success of the innovation.

Introduction
Enthusiasm and expectations about the benefits that an eportfolio system could bring for students has run very
high recently. However, current practices of developing and implementing eportfolio systems are primarily
determined by administrators or faculty; students' voices are substantially neglected from both practices and
research (Ayala, 2006). Research shows that it is important to understand whether users view a product as
valuable even before they have any real experiences with it, because such perceptions may strongly influence
their intention to use the product and the level of satisfaction that they feel with it (Sweeny & Soutar, 2001).
While Davis, et al. (1989) called for an investigation on "how far upstream in the development process we can
push user acceptance testing (p.1000)," on the basis of the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (Rogers, 2003) and
Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, et al.), this study proposed and tested a model to show how users'
intentions to use an eportfolio system may be predicted by variables such as prior experiences, key usability
concerns, perceived values, organizational championships, and attitudes before users have any chance to interact
with the system. Eight hypotheses for the relations between these variables constituted this model.
H1: Perceived values may significantly influence users' intention to use an eportfolio system.
H2: Perceived values may significantly influence the perceived importance of the key usability concerns.
H3: Perceived key usability concerns may significantly influence users' attitude toward using an eportfolio
system.
H4: Perceived importance of institutional championship may significantly influence the perceived values of an
eportfolio system.
H5: Perceived importance of institutional championship may significantly influence the perceived importance of
key usability features
H6: Perceived importance of institutional championship may significantly influence the attitudes toward using
an eportfolio system.
H7: Users' attitudes toward using an eportfolio system may significantly influence users' intention touse it.
H8: Users' prior experience may significantly influence the perceived importance of the key usability features.

Method
A web-based questionnaire composed of 6 scales (for the aforementioned 5 predicting variables and 1 dependent
variable)         with       a     total      of   40       items      measured             with           5-point    Likert     scales  was   developed. Exploratory  and
confirmatory factor analyses were conducted and identified two to three factors within each scales (Figure 1).
Three hundred and sixty four college students who never used an eportfolio system before were invited to
participate in this study.
           AMOS was used to test the convergent validity. The standardized path loadings were all significant and
greater than 0.7. The composite reliability (CR) and the Cronbach's alpha for all constructs exceeded 0.7, and
the average            variance              extracted           (AVE)          for      each       construct         was      greater than  0.6. These   results suggested
satisfactory convergent validity of this model. The tests on the structural model found that all the fit indices and
the parsimonious fit measures meet the recommended criteria (Figure 1). These results suggested that this model
appropriately explains the structure of the data and that all hypotheses were supported.

Conclusion
Implementing                 an    information              system,           such       as    eportfolio          in schools,     is  usually a  big investment  and often
susceptible            to    failure         if    users'        opinions        were          not    well      considered.       This  study   provided  a framework   for
understanding factors that influence users' intention to use a system before they have real experience with it. It
helps to evaluate the feasibility of implementing an innovation.
