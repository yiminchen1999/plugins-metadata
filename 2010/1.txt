          Abstract:    Do    pictorial  illustrations distract    from   learning  and,  thus,  decrease   learning
          outcomes,    as suggested     by  Cognitive   Load    Theory   and  Cognitive    Theory  of Multimedia
          Learning? Or can pictorial illustrations trigger interest and thereby enhance the willingness to
          learn as suggested by interest theories? Although these approaches seem to contradict each
          other, we  assume     that   they are  compatible:    Pictorial illustrations  may   hamper    short-term
          learning  but   raise interest   and  engagement      so  that in  the  medium    run   learning   may be
          enhanced. In order to test our "integrative" hypothesis, we explored the potential of different
          types of pictorial illustrations to trigger situational interest in the context of geometry learning.
          Results showed an effect of pictorial illustrations on the interestingness of geometry problems.
          In  addition,  interest in further   learning with    the computer-based     learning   environment   was
          higher   with  pictorial illustrations  than  without.    On   the  other hand,   interest in  deepening
          geometry knowledge was reduced when illustrations were added.

Introduction
Most (German) mathematical textbooks are full of pictorial illustrations. Does this make sense given that such
pictorial illustrations may be "seductive details" that impede learning (Harp & Mayer, 1997, 1998)? Or do they
actually enhance interest and, thereby, the willingness to engage in learning? Weidenmann (1991) suggests that
pictorial illustrations have different supporting functions such as activation, construction, or focusing special
aspects of the learning materials. In addition, Anglin, Towers, and Levie (1996) suggest in their review that
pictorial  illustrations­beside   their compensatory,      cognitive,  and   attentional functions­also    have  an affective
function in learning.
          Contrary  to   these  assumptions    on the  beneficial   functions   of  pictorial illustrations, Cognitive  Load
Theory    (Sweller, 2005)­which        assumes   that  many     difficulties in   learning are  due   to  unnecessary   (i.e.,
extraneous) working memory load­postulates a number of potential negative effects of pictorial illustrations
(Sweller, van Merrienboër & Paas, 1998): Redundancy effect (i.e., when different sources such as pictures and
text provide the same information and, thus, induce unnecessary processing demands), split-attention effect (i.e.,
extraneous    load  due   to difficulties   in mapping     text and    pictures), and  extraneous    load  due  to  irrelevant
illustrations that  do   not contain   essential information.     Similarly,  Cognitive  Theory   of  Multimedia    Learning
(Mayer, 2005) predicts that words, illustrations, or sounds which are not relevant to the central learning goals
should be omitted (e.g., Harp & Mayer, 1997, 1998). In addition to the redundancy effect (Mayer, Heiser &
Lonn, 2001; Moreno & Mayer, 2002) and split-attention effect (Mayer & Moreno, 1998; Moreno & Mayer,
1999; Moreno, Mayer, Spires, & Lester, 2001) Mayer and Moreno (2003) refer to the coherence effect (e.g.,
unnecessary load through interesting but extraneous material). In conclusion, learning materials should be as
concise as possible (Mayer & Moreno, 2003). Both theories suggest eliminating any redundant or decorative
elements. Accordingly, computer-based multimedia environments should not contain redundant or decorative
pictorial illustrations.
          In the last years, however, even cognitive load researchers increasingly call for the consideration of
motivational and emotional aspects (e.g., Zander, Brünken, 2009; Paas, Tuovinen, van Merrienboër & Darabi,
2005;  van   Merrienboër     &  Ayres,  2005).  Against    this background,    the  construct  of interest seems   especially
relevant (Tulis, 2009; Krapp, 1999, 2000; Krapp, Hidi & Renninger, 1992). It comprises a value-related and
emotion-related component (Schiefele, Krapp, Wild & Winteler, 1992). Hidi (2000) distinguishes between two
different, but linked    types  of interest,   individual  and  situational  interest. Individual  interest  is defined as a
relatively stable  predisposition,   whereas    situational   interest arises as  a reaction   to environmental    input, for
example, visual and auditory (Krapp, 1999). Research has shown that (situational) interest eases comprehension
(Hidi, 2001) and learning (Ainley, Hidi & Berndorff, 2002; Hidi, 2001; Schiefele, 1998). Explanations for such
effects include deeper processing, and a higher degree of cognitive organization (Ryan, Connell & Plant, 1990).
Interest is also positively related to persistence (Ainley, Hidi, 2002; Ainley, et. al., 2002), activation (Schiefele,
1990), and    elaboration    (Krapp,   1999;   Schiefele,  1996,   Ryan   et al., 1990).   Furthermore,   it is essential for

engagement in learning (Anderman, Noar, Zimmerman, & Donohew, 2004). Examples of factors that trigger
and maintain situational interest are novelty, concreteness, and visual imagery (Hidi, 2001). Most results on
situational and individual interest were found in the context of learning from text. Concreteness, a personally
relevant   context,  ease    of comprehension,     and   unexpected   information     (see   Anderson,    Shirey, Wilson   &
Fielding, 1987; Hidi & Baird, 1986, 1988) are, for example, factors that trigger and maintain situational interest
in text  learning.   One  way   to  adapt  these   aspects to computer-based     multimedia     environment    is the  use of
concrete, meaningful and relevant context oriented pictorial illustrations.
           Although   the  different theoretical   perspectives  on  potential  effects   of  pictorial illustrations seem to
contradict each other, we assumed that they are compatible: Pictorial illustration may hinder short-term learning
outcomes but can raise interest and engagement so that in the medium term learning is enhanced. As a first step
in testing our "integrative" hypothesis, we conducted a study to explore the following aspects: First, we were
interested whether pictorial illustrations can actually increase situational interest. Second, we wanted to identify
sets of pictorial illustrations that do or that do not enhance situational interest in the domain of geometry. These
pictorial illustrations will subsequently be used to test the integrative hypothesis in the context of learning with
intelligent tutoring environments (here: Cognitive Tutors; Koedinger & Corbett, 2006). Up to now, most of the
interest research has been conducted in the context of learning from text (Anderson, Shirey, Wilson & Fielding,
1987; Hidi & Baird, 1986, 1988). Our third goal was to test whether and how the four factors mentioned above
would affect situational interest for the case of pictorial illustrations in the context of tutoring environments. A
last goal was to identify potential relationships between picture-induced interest and the willingness to work
with a picture-enriched computer-based learning environment as well as the willingness to deepen geometry
knowledge.

Method

Participants and Design
Participants were 87 students (52 female, 35 male) from grade 8 of a German secondary school (age: M = 13.9
years; SD = 0.6). In a within-subjects design, students evaluated screenshots showing geometry problems with
and without pictorial illustrations. In order to be able to evaluate a larger number of pictorial illustrations, we
used   a multi-matrix-design     with eight  questionnaires.   Within  each    questionnaire   one   half of  the screenshots
corresponded to another half of the screenshots of another questionnaire.
           More specifically, the main part of the questionnaire consisted of fifteen screenshots of a computer-
based    learning environment    on   the  topic intersecting  lines (mathematical      principles:  angle  addition, vertical
angles, linear pair, and complementary angle). Each screenshot showed a word problem and a corresponding
line drawing. The problems varied in the number of sub-problems (one to three). Eleven of the fifteen drawings
included pictorial illustrations that­from an instructional designer's point of view­were mainly decorative (i.e.,
without    explicit  instructional  functions  such   as providing   information     or activating  relevant  schemas).  The
remaining   four    drawings    did  not   include  a pictorial  illustration. However,      each   of  these four  drawings
corresponded to one of the drawings that included a pictorial illustration.

Materials
The  screenshots     were  taken from    a Cognitive   Tutor  Geometry   (Koedinger      &   Corbett,  2006). The   Cognitive
Tutor is an Intelligent Tutoring System based on cognitive theory (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger & Pelletier,
1995).   Cognitive   Tutors  promote     learning  by  tutored  problem  solving.    They    provide   step-by-step   feedback
adapted to the actual knowledge level of students. Cognitive Tutors are successfully applied in a diverse set of
domains    such   as mathematics,    genetics,   and  computer   programming    (for    an overview,    see Anderson   et. al.,
1995; Koedinger & Corbett, 2006).
           All pictorial illustrations were drawn from a pool of 44 illustrations. They showed real-life situations
(e.g., sitting in   front of computer,     gables, and   compasses).  In the   first part  of the questionnaire,   each  page
contained a screenshot of a geometry problem from the Cognitive Tutor lesson either with or without pictorial
illustration (see Figures 1 and 2). Students had to rate the interestingness (adapted from Schiefele, 1990) of the
screenshots on two different subscales (nine point Likert scales). The first subscale referred to the emotion-
related component of interestingness, the second subscale to the value-related component (see Figures 1 and 2).
The emotion-related component was assessed by the three items Excitement, Entertainment, and Boredom, the
value-related component by the items Usefulness, Worthless, and Unimportance (similar items were used by
Schiefele, 1990). Furthermore, for each screenshot the students rated (on nine point Likert scales) the previously
mentioned four potential factors for interest (concreteness, ease of comprehension, unexpected information, and
personally relevant context; see bottom part of figure 1 and 2).
           Further questions (to be rated on five point Likert scales) referred to willingness for further learning
with   the computer-based       learning environment     (enriched with  pictorial   illustrations),  willingness  to  deepen

geometry knowledge, individual topic interest related to the content of the pictorial illustrations, to computer
knowledge and mathematics knowledge and demographic characteristics.

Procedure
The study was performed in group sessions. The sessions lasted about 28 minutes (Range: 16 - 46 minutes).
First, all students were introduced to the topic of intersecting lines by the experimenter. Then, they received an
example of how to evaluate the screenshots. In order to provide a context as much similar as possible to actually
working with the computer-based learning environment, the students then worked on four geometry problems
(two with line drawings, two with line drawings enriched with pictorial illustrations). Afterwards the students
rated  the interestingness of the screenshots   and they  were  asked  to rate different potential reasons    for their
interest. Finally, all participants answered a set of additional questions (e.g., demographic characteristics).

Results
Our first research question referred to a potential effect of pictorial illustrations on situational interest. A paired
t-test (two-tailed) revealed  a significant difference   between  screenshots  (i.e., geometry  problems)     with and
without pictorial illustrations, t(85) = 4.02, p < .001, d = .55. Figure 3 shows that this effect can largely be
attributed to the   emotion-related component    of interest, t(85)  = 6.68, p < .001,   d = .88,  as there   were  no
differences  in the value-related component,    t(85)  =  0.85, n.s, d =.11. Therefore,  in all further analyses   we
concentrated on the emotion-related component (if not stated otherwise).

                  Figure 3. Effect of pictorial illustrations on interest (emotion-related and value-related)

         Our    second goal was    to distinguish  between   the most interesting and   the    least interesting pictorial
illustrations. We compared the effect sizes between the most interesting pictorial illustrations (upper quarter)
and the least interesting pictorial illustrations (lower quarter). This comparison yielded an effect size of d = .56
for the  ninth  most   interesting pictorial  illustration compared   to the   ninth least     interesting  one. Pictorial
illustrations rated as "interesting" could be characterized as dynamic (e.g., showing activities such as sailing,
volleyball, or riding). The most interesting picture, for example, showed a sailboat sailing close to the wind.
Pictorial illustrations rated as "non-interesting" could be characterized as static (e.g., showing artifacts such as
compasses, maps, or traffic signs). One of the least interesting pictures, for example, was a canvas. Therefore, it
can be speculated that dynamic attributes are perceived as more entertaining, less boring and more exciting.
         Our third goal was to assess whether and how factors that were found to increase interest in texts (i.e.,
concreteness, personally relevant context, ease of comprehension, and unexpected information) could be related
to  interest in tutoring environments    that are  enriched  with  pictorial illustrations. Table    1 shows  that in the
present study each of these four factors correlated significantly with both the emotion-related component and
the value-related  component   of  interest.  This result  supports the notion  that these     factors that are  related to
interest as induced by texts also have a psychological validity for interest as induced by pictorial illustrations (in
tutoring environments).

         Against  the  background     of this strong pattern  of correlations, we were  interested     whether   and how
these reasons would differ in situations (i.e., geometry problems) in which pictorial illustrations were available
or  not. Paired  t-tests (two-tailed)    showed that  concreteness   was  rated  higher     in situations   with pictorial
illustrations than in situations without, t(85) = 12.24, p < .001, d = -1.76. Similarly, the perceived personally
relevant context was rated higher in situations with pictorial illustrations t(85) = -2.28, p < .05, d= -0.21. There
were, however, no significant differences for ratings of, the ease of comprehension (t(85) = 0.91, n.s., d = .00)
or unexpected information, t(85) = -1.98, n.s., d = -0.20.

          In   summary,   this   pattern  of  results indicates   that  decorative    pictorial illustrations  increased  the
perceived personal relevance and perceived concreteness of the learning material, but they did not increase the
perceived ease of comprehension. This latter finding further indicates that the pictorial illustrations might not
have activated relevant schemas as suggested, for example, by Schwartz and Collins (2008).
          Finally,  we  were     interested   in whether    pictorial   illustrations can   enhance    further learning   and
engagement. For this purpose, we investigated the relationships between interest in situations with and without
pictorial illustration and both the willingness to deepen geometry knowledge as well as in further learning with
the illustration-enriched computer based learning environment. As can be seen in Table 2, the willingness to
deepen geometry knowledge and the willingness for further learning with the computer-based environment were
positively related to interest ratings (irrespective of the availability of pictorial illustration).

computer-based learning environment and to deepen geometry knowledge (in Parentheses: partial correlations
controlling for individual interest in geometry).

          Comparisons of the correlation coefficients between mathematical problems with and without pictorial
illustrations,  however,  showed     that  the correlations   between   interest and   the   willingness   to learn  with the
computer-based learning environment was rated significantly higher when a pictorial illustration was available
than when    it was  not, t(84)  =   2.58, p   < .05. This  was   not  the case  for  the correlations  of  interest  and the
willingness to deepen geometry knowledge, t(84) = 1.89, n.s.
          As it can be assumed that students who are generally interested in geometry might not need pictorial
illustration to further increase   their   interest, we  controlled   the individual   interest in learning   geometry.   The
difference   of the  partial correlations   (see  Table  2, in parentheses)    between    interest and  the   willingness for
further  learning  with  the  environment      remained    significant, t(84)  = 2.35,  p   < .05. In  addition,   the partial
correlation  between    interest and  the  willingness   to deepen    geometry   knowledge      became  significant,   t(84) =
2.24, p < .05.
          Thus, interest as induced by pictorial illustrations seemed to be strongly positively related to students'
perceptions of the learning environment more than to their willingness to deepen geometry knowledge. On the
other hand, interest as induced by the mathematical problems per se (i.e., when no pictorial illustration was
available) was strongly related to the willingness to deepen geometry knowledge; there was no such relationship
for interest when a pictorial illustration was available. In other words, students who like pictorial illustrations
might prefer to work with a computer-based learning environment but they are not necessarily interested in
deepening geometry knowledge.

Discussion
The  main    purpose of   the  present   study   was  to identify   pictorial illustrations  with  the potential to  enhance
interest. A secondary purpose was to test whether factors that were found to increase interest as suggested by
text research (e.g., text attributes such as concreteness) might also enhance interest in the context of illustrated
tutoring  environments.   A    final purpose     was  to explore  the   relationships  between    interest and  the  students'
willingness to engage in further learning.
          The results showed that pictorial illustration increased the emotion-related component of interest, but
not the value-related component. This suggests that the illustrations were mainly perceived as decorative but not
as informative.    Furthermore,   our  findings   also   suggest  that  interest-evoking    attributes as  identified  in text
research  can   be   transferred  to   interest   research  with    pictorial  illustrations  (in  the context   of   tutoring
environments), at least in part: The pictorial illustrations did not­according to the learners' perception­enhance
comprehension     or provide   unexpected     information.    However,    they were   perceived    as  making  the  geometry
problems more concrete and to provide a personally relevant context. These results are first indications that
pictorial illustrations do   not give  a   semantic   context  and, therefore,   activate certain  schemas     which   support
learning (Schwartz & Collins, 2008). Further steps to investigate not only the perceived ease of comprehension,
but real comprehension (in terms of conceptual and procedural knowledge) will be taken in a subsequent study.
          Interestingly, the more the students perceived the pictorial illustrations as interesting the higher was
their willingness to learn with a picture-enriched computer-based learning environment. Contrary, interest in
pictorial illustrations was   unrelated    to the willingness    to deepen    geometry  knowledge      (especially  when  the

individual geometry    interest was held  constant).   The  willingness   to deepen   geometry   knowledge  was  rather
related to interest in mathematical problems without pictorial illustrations. It can be speculated that students
might have realized the "decorative" aspect of the pictorial illustrations, and thus, perceived them as irrelevant
for further engagement in learning geometry. In conclusion, interesting pictures might primarily influence how
much students engage in further working in a learning environment, but not necessarily how much they engage
in concentrating   on   the  learning content.  In    these respects,   the  present  findings  quite  well reflect  the
contradictive positions  between    interest research   and cognitive    research. As suggested   by  interest research,
pictorial illustrations can enhance interest and the willingness to learn. At the same time, however, students can
perceive pictorial illustrations as irrelevant for deepening geometry knowledge, as suggested by the cognitive
research.
          A restriction of this study was that we did not measure learning outcomes. Moreover, the students did
not work in a real computer-based learning environment (e.g., a Cognitive Tutor). Therefore, our conclusions
are based on self-assessed measurements. An interesting question with respect to learning outcomes arises from
the finding that interest elicited by decorative pictures seemed to foster the willingness for further working with
a picture-enriched computer program but not to deepen geometry knowledge. If the learners would actually
show certain persistence in working with an illustrated computer program, but without intentions to deepen the
geometry   knowledge,    would   this nevertheless     deepen    their understanding?    A   follow-up experiment    (in
preparation) will address this question. In addition, it will explicitly test our integrative hypothesis stating that
pictorial illustration may   hinder short-term  learning    but  may   raise interest and  engagement   so  that in  the
medium term learning is enhanced. In order to test this assumption, we will compare three experimental groups
(students from the 8th grade) working in a Cognitive Tutor Geometry (topic of intersecting lines): one group
with interesting pictorial illustration, one with non-interesting pictorial illustrations (control of picture effects),
and one group without any pictorial illustrations. While working with the computer-based learning environment
the students will rate the interestingness of the pictorial illustrations after each geometry problem. Before and
after the  learning    phase  a  geometry    knowledge      test (conceptual   and    procedural  knowledge)    will be
administered. In   addition,  data on interest and    mood  experiences     will be  collected. During the  two  weeks
between the immediate posttest and a delayed posttest the students will have the opportunity to deepen their
geometry knowledge by studying a small geometry booklet (at home). The delayed posttest will be very similar
to the first posttest but will additionally include problems from the booklet. We assume that in the immediate
posttest learners will be best off without pictorial illustrations. For the delayed posttest, we expect, however,
that interesting pictorial illustrations will lead to superior learning.
