        Abstract:   Although   Learning    Management        Systems    (LMS)   are   ubiquitous   in  higher
        education, little is known about how faculty and students use them for blended learning. In
        this symposium, we present data from online surveys, system log data, and case studies to
        investigate the practice of university teaching with LMS to provide feedback about how to
        successfully implement these systems. We examine instructors' and students' attitudes about
        LMS   and  their  use of   these systems   at different levels   of analysis, looking  across   many
        institutions and increasingly narrowing the focus to several specific teaching vignettes. We
        organize our investigations of how instructors and students value the LMS by examining three
        types  of  use:  Learner-Content   interactions,   Learner-Instructor   interactions,  and  Learner-
        Learner interactions. We identify common themes and differences revealed by our analyses to
        make   recommendations     that  are intended     to improve    teaching and     learning with  these
        systems.

Symposium Overview
Recent surveys  have shown    that Learning   Management       Systems   (LMS)   have  become     ubiquitous in higher
education (Hawkins   &   Rudy, 2008;     Smith, Salaway,     & Caruso,   2009)  and their  use in  K-12  education   is
growing rapidly  (Picciano  &  Seaman,    2009). Although      these systems  have  become    basic infrastructure  for
learning in higher education, we know very little about using LMS to enhance teaching and learning. Few
studies have looked specifically at hybrid or blended learning environments (e.g., augmenting traditional face-
to-face instruction with online learning applications). Of these studies, most have been conducted by "professors
and other instructors who are conducting research (on) their own courses" (Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakai &
Jones, 2009, p. 49). With so many instructors using these systems on so many campuses, we believe it is
possible to generalize "lessons learned" about LMS use at a level of granularity beyond reports from individual
classrooms. These lessons can help improve the practice of university teaching with LMS, as well as provide
important feedback for considerations of how to successfully implement these systems with younger students.
        In this symposium, we present four papers that carefully examine instructors' and students' attitudes
about LMS and their reported use of these systems, beginning with a wide-angle lens looking across many
institutions and increasingly narrowing the focus to several specific teaching vignettes. Paper 1 uses a survey
conducted at 11 American universities looking to examine how LMS use differs between research and non-
research institutions. Paper 2 takes a similar approach, but contrasts LMS uses between one residential campus
and one commuter campus within one institution. Paper 3 investigates qualitative survey data to analyze how
the use of a LMS impacts instructors' use of in-class time. Finally, Paper 4 describes three case studies of
exemplary LMS use within the disciplines of nursing, engineering, and music. By focusing our analysis at
different scales, we can better understand the ways in which LMS are being used in numerous higher education
institutions, the factors that may be driving these uses (e.g., research vs. teaching emphasis, residential vs.
commuter students), the ways instructors and students are choosing to use them, and the effects these systems
may have on students' classroom experiences.
        A  typical LMS    provides  a number    of specific    tools supporting  diverse  functionality ranging  from
"materials management" to organize interactions between the student and the course content (e.g., syllabus,
course readings,  lecture slides), "interactive  teaching"   to organize    interactions between   the  instructor and
students (notifications, assignments, quizzes), and "peer learning" (peer review, group projects, student wikis)
(Lonn & Teasley, 2009). With the diversity of tools available within these systems, investigations of the effects
of LMS on teaching and learning must clearly specify functionalities and the particular instructional uses of
those functionalities. The legacy of research on learning technology has clearly demonstrated that how a tool is
used is more critical than the tool itself (Salomon, Perkins, & Globerson, 1991). Therefore, in this symposium,
we organize our investigations of how instructors and students value and use LMS functionalities by examining
three types of instructional uses for those functionalities: Learner-Content interactions (LC), Learner-Instructor
interactions (LI), and Learner-Learner interactions (LL) (see also Moore, 1989, Bernard et al., 2009).

Paper 1: A Multi-Institutional Analysis of Interactions Supported by a LMS
Andrew E. Krumm and Steven Lonn

Introduction
Researchers of distance education conditions demonstrate that different interaction types can support different
learning outcomes (e.g., Bernard et al., 2009). In this paper, we explore how instructors and students value
specific uses for a LMS grouped under specific interaction types: Learner-Instructor (LI), Learner-Content (LC),
and Learner-Learner (LL) interactions. For this study, we recruited 11 American universities using the same
LMS, asking instructors (N=2,570) and students (N=6,980) to indicate their perceptions of LMS functionalities
in an online survey. Using this large and diverse sample, we addressed four research questions: (1) Do
instructors and students value interaction types differently? Do respondents value interaction types differently
based on (2) their university setting, (3) the number of courses they have used a LMS, and (4) their preference
for using IT in courses?

Method
To construct LC, LI, and LL interaction types, we coded participants' responses on items asking them to rate
how much they value particular uses of a LMS. Using a 5-pont Likert scale, respondents rated how much they
valued, for example, "Posting a lecture outline or notes before the lecture." We coded each item using Moore's
(1989) and   Bernard  et al.'s (2009)  descriptions  of  interaction  types.  After coding each    item,  we employed
principal component analysis to extract single components for items coded under the same interaction type: LC
(4 items, eigenvalue = 2.613, alpha = .817), LI (7 items, eigenvalue = 4.05, alpha = .878), and LL (4 items,
eigenvalue = 3.117, alpha = .904).
         Each extracted component, i.e., interaction type, served as dependent variables in three separate two-
level hierarchical linear models (HLM). Survey respondents were modeled at level-1 and university effects at
level-2. Within each model we included four independent variables in line with our four research questions: a
research/non-research university dummy variable, an instructor/student dummy variable, a number of courses
for which one has used a LMS variable, and a how much one uses/prefers IT in courses variable. We also
included five control variables: perceived expertise with computers, frequency of LMS visits, general perceived
value of a LMS for course activities, and perceptions of value for IT to improve teaching and learning. All non-
dummy    variables were  grand    mean centered  to  improve    the interpretability of each  model's     intercept. The
research/non-research  dummy      variable was  modeled     as a level-2   predictor while   all   other variables   were
modeled as level-1 predictors.

Results
In line with our four research questions, we identified differences between instructors and students for LC and
LI interaction  types (RQ   #1),   between  participants    in research   and non-research   universities   for the   LL
interaction type (RQ #2), and among the number of courses for which one has used a LMS for LC and LL
interaction types (RQ #3). Use of IT was a significant predictor across all models (RQ #4).
         Students, on average, valued LC (B = .09, p < .05) and LI (B = .208, p < .001) interactions more than
instructors. Number of courses for which one has used a LMS had a positive statistically significant effect for
LC interactions (B = .031, p < .05) and a negative effect for LL interactions (B = -.057, p < .01). Participants in
a  non-research university  were   found   to value  LL     interactions more  than  those in    a research  university,
controlling for all other factors (B = .39, p < .05). No other research/non-research university differences were
identified.
         The  performances     of control  variables were     largely consistent across  all models.     Expertise   with
computers had a small but negative effect for only the LI model (B = -.068, p < .05). How often one visits a
LMS was a positive predictor across all models (LC, B = .126, p < .001; LI, B = .151, p < .001; LL, B = .105, p
< .001). The perceived value of a LMS for improving course activities was a strong, positive predictor across all
models (LC, B = .274, p < .001; LI, B = .269, p < .001; LL, B = .167, p < .001) as was the perceived value of IT
to improve teaching (LC, B = .108, p < .001; LI, B = .143, p < .001; LL, B = .157, p < .001) and learning (LC, B
= .214, p < .001; LI, B = .185, p < .001; LL, B = .134, p < .001).

Discussion
In answering RQ #1, we observed that students value LC and LI interactions more highly than instructors,
controlling for all other factors. Students, on average, value LC interactions only slightly more than instructors
and value LI interactions to a much higher degree than instructors. These observations signal that students may
value access to content but value access to their instructors more. Individuals, whether instructor or student,
within non-research universities valued LL interactions .39 standard deviations more than individuals within
research universities (RQ  #2).   Whether   a respondent    was  located  within a   non-research   university  was   the

largest single determiner for how much one values LL interactions. The specific LMS uses that make up this
interaction type provide few clues as to why there exist such distinct differences (e.g., Students work together
on task/assignment;    Students    read/comment    on  each    others'   work;   Students   generate/share instructional
materials; Students part of ad-hoc student groups or teams). These practices, in general, do not appear to favor
one institutional type over another at the grain of size of research/non-research universities.
       The     effect  of one's  experience   with  a  LMS     is also interesting  with  respect to  differences across
interaction types (RQ #3). Controlling for all other factors, a one unit change in the number of courses for which
one has used a LMS, which equates to approximately 3 courses, is associated with a .031 standard deviation
increase in how much one values LC interactions and a .057 decrease in how much one values LL interactions.
Why more experience using a LMS leads to an increase in one interaction type and a decrease in another may
have to do with how much one values IT that is different from a LMS. As the number of courses for which one
has used a LMS increases, he or she may value other IT for LL interactions. This conclusion is tangentially
supported   by the    strength  of the IT  related  questions     within   the LL   models,  and  the strength  of one'
use/preference of IT in particular (RQ #4). Within the LL model, one's use of IT was a much stronger predictor
than the same variable within the other two models, respectively. In general, examining how much instructors
and students value uses for a LMS across 11 universities has provided an important wide-angle lens on issues to
be explored within campuses, classrooms, and instructors.

Paper 2: Commuter vs. Residential: LMS Perceptions & Use on Two Campuses
Steven Lonn and Andrew E. Krumm

Introduction
In this study, we used the same survey described in Paper 1 to specifically explore differences in respondents'
attitudes about LMS use and actual experience with a LMS between instructors and students at two campuses of
a Midwestern    university:   a large  residential campus    and   a   smaller  commuter    campus.  We  also  analyzed
aggregated log data from the LMS to see if students' system use was consistent with their beliefs. Although
there have been some multi-campus studies of LMS (e.g., Harrington et al., 2004), none have focused on the
possible differences between residential and commuter institutions. Online technologies have been found to
significantly affect the nature of interactions between commuter students and with their instructors (Krause,
2007). The specific research questions we address in this paper are: (1) Do instructors and students at the two
campuses    differ in  their perceptions  of different types   of  interactions  supported  by LMS?    (2) When    other
factors, such as number of courses using the LMS, are taken into account, do differences between campuses still
exist? (3) How does actual LMS use compare to survey attitudes and perceptions?

Method
The sample for the online survey included instructors (residential n=612, 16% response rate (r.r.); commuter
n=64, 19% r.r.) and undergraduate students (residential n=1182, 22% r.r.; commuter n=805, 19% r.r.) who
taught or were enrolled in at least one course with a LMS site. We then used the system's event logs to create an
aggregated   data  set representing   the activity in  the   sites in  which   the  student respondents  were   enrolled
(residential n=1,565; commuter n=287).

         As in Paper 1, the survey data was categorized as LC, LI, or LL interactions. We analyzed the results
using three  HLM   models. We  identified five factors    of interest: (1) differences between   campuses    and  (2)
between instructors and students, (3) number of courses for which the LMS has been used (4) how often the
respondent visits LMS course sites and (5) how much one uses/prefers IT for course activities. We included four
control variables: perceived expertise with  computers,     perceived  value of  a LMS   for   course activities, and
perceived value of IT to improve teaching and learning.

Results
The first phase of our analysis investigated individual survey items, grouped by interaction type. In general,
instructors rated nearly all survey items at a 4.0 or above on a 5-point Likert scale, meaning that they "agreed"
or "strongly agreed" that all of these activities within LMS were valuable. When first investigating differences
between  residential and   commuter    campus  respondents,     there  were  no    significant differences  between
instructors for Learner-Content, Learner-Instructor,      or Learner-Learner    interactions.  Student respondents,
however, significantly differed on several survey items. The students' ratings of the survey items were also
generally high at a 4.0 or above for most LC and LI items, but somewhat lower for LL items (means between
3.37-3.83). Compared to the commuter students, the residential students rated all four of the LC items higher,
five of the seven LI items lower, and all four of the LL items lower. Many of these differences were significant
(see Table 1).

**p<.01, ***p<.001

         We also ran 3 HLMs in order to identify factors that might affect how much a survey respondent values
a particular interaction type. On average, respondents from the commuter campus valued LI (B = .428, p < .001)
and LL (B = .363, p. < .01) interactions more than their residential counterparts, controlling for all other factors.
Also, students more favorably rated LI interactions more than instructors.
         Finally, we calculated the average percentage of total events for each LMS tool by aggregating the
events for the LMS course sites. The respondents on the residential campus used three of the four LC-oriented
tools more than their commuter campus counterparts while the commuter campus users used four of the eight
LI-oriented tools, and all five of the LL-oriented tools more, by percentage, than the residential campus users.
The specific differences that were significant are shown in Table 2.

Discussion
When   we examined    the reasons  underlying  the overall     positive ratings of the LMS    activities, a distinctive
pattern emerged: residential students rated Learner-Content survey items more highly than commuter students
and  commuter  students   rated  Learner-Learner items     more  highly  than   residential students. Ratings   for the
Learner-Instructor activities were mixed. The log data supported these findings showing higher activity in the
most heavily used LC-oriented tools for the residential campus and higher activity in the LL-oriented tools for
the commuter campus. Taking other factors (e.g., frequency of LMS use) into account, the differences between
the residential and commuter campus remain significant for LI and LL interaction, but not for LC-related uses.
         Commuter students may have relied on LMS interactive tools to communicate with instructors and
students with whom    they    do not otherwise   have    opportunities   to do  so  face-to-face  (Pascarella,  2006).
Furthermore,  commuter    campus  instructors  may  structure    their  courses to include  more  student   interaction
through the LMS as a consequence of diminished face-to-face time that is likely to be more easily accomplished
at the residential campus. Further study is needed to better understand exactly how residential and commuter
instructors structure the use of the LMS for course-related activities in order to help instructors and students at
both types of campuses use this technology to its fullest potential.

Introduction
In recent years, the ubiquitous use of online learning environments in American higher education has increased
the need to understand their effectiveness as pedagogical tools (e.g., Apedoe, 2005). This pervasive use also
necessitates understanding their influence on the quality of students' experiences and interactions in online and
blended  learning  environments   (e.g., Bernard   et  al.,   2009). Chickering    and Gamson    (1987)   posit seven
principles for good teaching practice in undergraduate education that have been used extensively to evaluate and
improve face-to-face pedagogy in higher education. In this paper, we employed four principles most relevant to
understanding the nature of interactions between students and instructors in the context of blended learning. The
first principle relates to instructors' and students' perceptions of the form and quality of LI interactions. The
second  principle relates to  interactions and cooperation     among    students.  The third  principle relates to  the
expectations that are communicated in courses using LMS as perceived by both instructors and students. The
fourth principle relates to ways that use of LMS tools structure and influence instructors' and students' time
inside and outside of class.
         This paper utilizes data from the online survey discussed in Paper 2 to investigate how the "blended"
use of a learning management system (LMS) affects instructors' use of in-class time, comparing instructors and
students at the residential and commuter campuses. We explore the issues survey respondents raise regarding
how LMS influences Learner-Instructor (LI), Learner-Learner (LL), and Learner-Content (LC) interactions. The
specific research questions that we address in this paper are: (1) In what ways does the use of LMS affect the
way instructors use in-class time in the higher education classroom? (2) How does the use of LMS in these
classrooms influence the Learner-Instructor and Learner-Content interactions? and (3) What are the effects of
LMS on Learner-Learner interaction during class time?

Methods
We analyzed an open-ended survey item about the instructors' use of in-class time from the survey described in
Paper 2. This item asks: "Do you think using the LMS has affected you/your instructors' use of in-class time? If
so, how?"  From   the residential  campus,   57.0%    of   students  (n=1,101)    and  55.3%  of instructors  (n=602)
responded about the effects of LMS use on in-class time. From the commuter campus, we received a 63.6%
student response rate (n=682) and a 72.4% instructor response rate (n=55).
         To categorize the survey answers, we made note of common themes and issues encountered, and used
these to collapse redundant categories. We arrived at a rubric with 12 codes for both the instructor and student
responses, and used up to three codes to describe each response (see Table 1). The rubric accounted for both
positive and negative responses concerning the affect of using LMS on instructors' in-class time. Inter-rater
reliability produced kappa statistics between 0.8 and 0.93.

Results
The majority of responses by students and instructors indicated that the LMS positively influenced instructors'
use of in-class time (see Table 1), where the most common responses were about facilitating logistics and
providing access to materials (Learner-Content interactions). More residential students (21.7%) than commuter
students (15.2%) mentioned improved efficiency and logistics. The differences between instructors were not as
pronounced (19.4% residential; 21.8% commuter). Almost twice as many commuter instructors replied that the

LMS affected in-class time by providing access to materials compared to the other three populations. However,
a significant portion of the sample indicated no change in their in-class time due to the LMS, slightly higher for
the residential campus respondents than the commuter campus respondents.
        Few respondents provided answers that suggested the LMS affected pedagogy or improved Learner-
Learner  or  Learner-Instructor   interaction. However,    we    did   find  that students at   both  campuses    (7.3%
residential; 11.6% commuter) perceived that instructors change the content or pace of instruction in classrooms
due to the LMS. Few instructors responded that there was a change in content or pace (3.5% residential; 1.8%
commuter). These data suggest that instructors and students at both campuses have different perceptions of how
LMS use affects in-class time. Last, many instructors' negative responses reflected their criticism of students
and technology while others mentioned a desire to improve the incorporation of LMS in their teaching. Students'
negative responses also spoke to instructors' use of LMS and included somewhat sophisticated views of how
technology could be better integrated into instructors' pedagogy.

Discussion
Overall, the majority of respondents indicated that LMS had a positive effect on instructors' use of in-class time.
Instructors  and students   generally   gave similar  reports    about   the nature  of   this change,   although  their
perceptions differed regarding the degree to which LMS use facilitated logistics, provided access to materials,
and changed the pace of instruction. There were far fewer negative responses but these were eye-opening. Some
residential instructors suggested that the LMS was beneficial only for out-of-class time, but they also talked
about  their own  lack  of  familiarity and  how students    were   using   LMS   instead of   coming to  class. A  few
residential students and commuter students, to a lesser degree, complained that instructors were completing
lessons too quickly or not covering material in sufficient depth in class because they posted materials online.
        From these data we can conclude that changes in the use of class time are mostly due to the increases in
Learner-Content (LC) interactions supported by the LMS. Log data from the LMS confirm that LC interaction is
the primary use of LMS at the residential and commuter campuses (see Paper 2). We found few responses about
changes in Learner-Instructor (LI) and Learner-Learner interactions as a result of LMS use. Also, there were
higher percentages     from commuter    students than   residential    students  mentioning    LI and LL   discussions.
Perhaps the capacity of the LMS to support LL and LI interaction is not needed as deeply at a residential
campus, where students and instructors may have more opportunities to interact face-to-face.
        We also see evidence that LMS can support the four principles of best practices for higher education
that we  examined     (Chickering &     Gamson,  1987).   First,   the efficient  availability of course  material  and
announcements support LC interactions. Second, discussion boards within LMS support LL interaction. Third,
course expectations are communicated through various resources, such as a syllabus, assignment instructions,
grades, and other materials, although students disagree on the extent to which this occurs. Finally, we found that
the LMS is particularly useful for structuring instructors' and students' time inside and outside of class through
improved    logistics and  organization  of  course materials.   Responses    across  campuses    revealed an    implicit
assumption that students learn material independently outside of class when LMS is used, and the reaction to
this assumption  was   mixed:  Instructors  thought this   was   a good  thing   and students   did not. Therefore,  we
recommend that future studies explore students' ability for self-regulated learning. We also recommend further
exploration for how LMS can better support LI and LL interaction more broadly across campus types.

Introduction
It would be pleasant to think of Learning Management Systems (LMS) as the perfect gift we gave ourselves to
celebrate the coming of age of higher education in the 21st century. A System to manage Learning, packaging up
the whole messy business of teaching and learning into a collection of neat, authenticated boxes wrapped in the
school colors and tied with a bow. That's what we ordered, and that's what typical LMS have delivered onto our
virtual doorstep, a stack of well-bundled packages. As we open up the boxes we are somewhat surprised, albeit
pleasantly, to find simple gifts: the typical LMS includes functionality to manage materials, view and assess
student  work,   and  support  communication.      However,    following   the gift metaphor,    faculty  are  left asking
themselves, "Socks? Just socks?" Wanting more are the educators dedicated to exploring the seemingly infinite
possibilities  poised by   new  technologies.   "These    users  are   more   interested  in support  for   their  need  to
experiment with new ideas in their teaching and learning environments and then evolve/improve those ideas as
they go along" (Severance, Hardin, & Whyte, 2008). Educators, and the organizations that support them, can go
shopping for themselves to seek out innovative, discipline-specific tools wherever they may be found.
          In this paper, I present vignettes of three instructors at a large Midwestern university teaching in the
Fall  2009  term   who   returned these  gifts  to themselves    in  concert   with the   local LMS.   These    instructors
successfully leverage the basic functionality of the system to frame and to extend their coveted discipline-
specific elements and to engage students in new ways with the course material, with the instructor, and with
each other.

The   Community    Health  Nursing  course   provides    an  example   of  an  instructor leveraging  the   local  LMS   to
enhance students' interactions with course materials (LC). This theory and clinical course requires students to
"think critically about the role and core competencies of community health nursing ... within diverse population
and   ecological contexts"  (quote from   the  online    course  description). In planning    this  course, the  instructor
sought out materials that not only presented data and policy about community health, but also presented the
stories of those being served. Specifically, she integrated materials from "The Neighborhood," an innovative,
virtual case-based learning strategy centered on interactions between the household and community agency
characters developed by a professor at another university. The interrelated stories unfold in weekly installments
and include photos, biographical information, medical records, and video clips.
          Even though "The Neighborhood" represents innovative, well-conceived, discipline-specific content,
it's not the   whole  course  package.   When    the  instructor  presents    the discipline-specific   content    of "The
Neighborhood"      within the structure  of the university's    LMS,   she  adds  context    by linking  more    traditional
articles and local community stories, often drawing from the daily headlines. She also facilitates workflow by
posting notifications and reminders within the LMS and she uses the LMS assessment tools to deliver rapid
feedback on graded activities. She is not using the novel, discipline-specific course material in place of the
standard LMS; she is using outside online materials in combination with the LMS.

Jazz Arranging is a composition class where the instructor utilizes the LMS as a platform for students to share
their original work with each other, as well as submit it for credit. Historically, students would compose and
turn  in their scores to  the instructor for   critique. Students   could  share  their  work   with each   other,  but the
arrangements needed to be heard to be properly evaluated. This practice posed significant challenges as students
had to perform their compositions for each other in class or record them outside of class for sharing later.
          The instructor experimented with and eventually adopted Sibelius, a leading musical notation software
package.  In   Sibelius, compositions   can  be archived     digitally and the  files play   themselves   so the   focus is
squarely  on   the composition  and  not  the  performer.    This instructor's integration   of  Sibelius   with  the LMS
benefits not only himself, but also his students. Now students are required to arrange their scores in Sibelius,
and the class meets in a computer lab where students can see and hear each other's arrangements by accessing
them via the LMS. The instructor uses the Assignments tool to collect and grade privately (LI), and then he
shares and discusses each student's work with the class. Facilitated by the LMS, each student-arranger has the
entire class as audience (LL). The instructor also uses several other LMS tools to manage class logistics, freeing
up class time to listen to students' music and to engage in discussion.

In Principles of Engineering Materials, the instructor leverages the local LMS to enhance students' Learner-
Instructor interactions (LI). This is an introductory Engineering course with both a weekly lecture presented by
the  faculty-instructor   and a   weekly discussion      session  led  by  a  teaching   assistant.  Typically   with   this
arrangement, student-instructor interaction is limited to well-timed nods and courtesy smiles passed back and

forth during the lecture. In this class, however, the instructor sought a way to engage students by directly
exposing and sharing his approach to weekly problem-solving assignments.
        In preparation for Fall 2009, the instructor purchased a LiveScribe system. He now records himself
solving key homework problems by hand every week. He clicks Record on his smartpen and then he starts
working through   the  solutions, talking through  each    step. Students  access    the resulting  "pencasts" via   the
standard LMS. Because students hear his voice and watch his pen draw the diagrams and formulas; because
they hear and see his scribbles and missteps; because they can start, stop, jump, and replay his recordings;
because these are personal recordings, the students have more interaction with the instructor, albeit one-way
interaction. The expectation is that this process provides not only a model of problem-solving but also a sense of
familiarity with the  instructor  that pays  forward to    provide  opportunities   for  richer engagement     with  the
instructor during lectures and office hours.
        What does the LMS offer this arrangement beyond a place to access the recordings? For one, the
instructor encourages students to bring laptops to lecture (supplying them when appropriate) and encourages
student use of the Chat tool during the lecture. The instructor can also use the Chat transcripts to assess student
comprehension and follow up with a specific student when appropriate. The LMS is flexible enough for him to
personalize the look, feel, and organization of his syllabus and schedule, drawing students into the LMS even
though he has the technical skills and resources to work outside it. In this regard, he meets students on familiar
ground, in the LMS, while in the same space offering them uncommon access to their professor and a window
into his problem solving processes.

Discussion
These instructors accept the basic tools that the LMS offers and employ them as the functional foundation for
students' interactions with the course materials, with each other, and with the instructor. It is worth noting that
the innovative  and  independent   elements    portrayed   in each  vignette   all engage  students  with  multimedia
artifacts via learner-driven navigation. The LMS supports these multimodal and personalized engagements by
enveloping them, not only structurally but also programmatically into the domain content. The LMS can be the
constant in the evolution of new learning models within and across specialized disciplines. To return to the
metaphor of gifts, innovative instructors in higher education know what they need: bring on the socks but don't
forget to tuck a gift certificate in with them. Some things, you just have to pick out for yourself.
