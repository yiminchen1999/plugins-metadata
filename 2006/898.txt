        Abstract:     We  examined     the  effects  of base ratio  and conceptual    structure on  accuracy     in
        multiplicative situations. Forty-eight 3rd and 5th graders solved 36 problems that varied in base
        ratio and conceptual structure. ANOVA results indicated that conceptual structure made a greater
        impact    on accuracy   than   did the  size of the base ratio. The   effect of structural constraint on
        accuracy     supports   the call   for deeper   conceptual  instruction  and  learning  in  mathematics
        education.

Introduction
            Research on children's arithmetic understanding has concentrated on addition, rather than multiplication.
Three common constructs of the investigations in both additive and multiplicative research are strategy (Sherin &
Fuson, 2005),    problem  size, and  problem    structure (Vergnaud,    1983).  Historically, these constructs   have   been
studied independently of one another. This paper reports on one part of a larger effort to build a more integrated
understanding of relationships among strategy, problem size, problem structure, and tool use. We examine the link
between  the  effects of  base   ratio and  conceptual    structure on  3rd and  5th graders'  accuracy   in multiplicative
situations.

Method
        Third-grade (n=24) and fifth-grade (n=24) public school students in a large urban district were individually
asked six sets of six questions. Accuracy (accurate/inaccurate) was measured as a function of grade, base ratio, and
conceptual structure. Base ratio was systematically varied across the six sets, with each set using different ratios,
specifically, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:9. The six questions in each set tapped four conceptual structures based on
Vergnaud's (1983) theory of conceptual fields (see Figure 1). The first three questions were consistent with structure
a but varied in number magnitude (i.e., 5, 8/9, and 10). The other three questions mapped on to structures b, c, and d,
respectively. The six questions were presented in a fixed order hypothesized to reflect increasing question difficulty.

                    Figure 1. Conceptual structures for the six question types in the structured interview.

For each    set, students first answered    three  simple proportion   problems   (Q1-Q3)     followed by  another     simple
proportion problem in which the dimensions changed (Q4), which in turn was succeeded by a concatenation of two
simple proportions problem (esp., quotitive division). The structural variance of these five questions, coupled with
the invariant question order lead to the following predicted order of accuracy:
                                                Q1  Q2  Q3 > Q4 > Q5                                                (1)
Because Q1 and Q3 had number magnitudes of 5 and 10, we wanted to evaluate the relationship between these two
questions. Additionally, a sixth question, Q6, was asked to examine the children's use of pragmatic knowledge to
solve simple quotitive division problems that involved a remainder.

Results
Grade x Base Ratio
        Figure 2a illustrates mean accuracy as a function of grade and base ratio. Employing a 2 (grade) x 6 (base
ratio) mixed model ANOVA, with grade (3, 5) as the between-groups variable and base ratio (1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:2, 1:3,
1:9) as the within-groups variable, we found main effects for grade (F (1, 46) = 4.46, p = .04, p2 = .09) and base
ratio (F (5, 230) = 2.50, p = .03, p2 = .05) on accuracy. The interaction was not significant. Post hoc comparisons of

difference was detected between the largest (1:6; M = 4.25, SD = 1.64) and (1:9; M = 3.73, SD = 1.85) smallest
group means.

Grade x Question
                                Mean accuracy as a function of grade and question is presented in Figure 2b. A 2 (grade) x 6 (structure)
mixed design ANOVA was performed on accuracy with grade (3, 5) as the between-groups factor and conceptual
structure                        of         the questions                 (Q1,   Q2,       Q3,          Q4, Q5,         Q6) as the                              within-groups              factor.         Not           surprisingly,               the analysis
showed a main effect for grade (F (1, 46) = 4.37, p = .04, p2 = .09) and also question (F (5, 230) = 61.66, p < .001,
p2 = .57) and no grade x question interaction.

     Figure                         2b          shows        that         simple          proportion         questions         (Q1-Q3)                                    were          about          equal         in  accuracy,           Q4       was  more
difficult, and Q5 and Q6, the two quotitive division questions, were least accurate. A planned comparison using
customized contrast coefficients aligned with the prediction in Equation 1 showed general trend agreement, Ffit (4,
184) = 100.90, p < .001, p2 = 25. This finding was validated by a confirmatory test of model-to-data fit, (Ffailure (1,
138) =                          1.50,       ns),  indicating                  that       nothing         other         than structure                             contributed              to          the differences                 in the         means. An
additional planned comparison revealed a significant mean difference between Q1 (M = 5.50, SD = 1.09) and Q3 (M
= 4.96, SD = 1.66) on accuracy, F (1, 46) = 8.78, p < .01, p2 = .16. The results show that the conceptual structure of
the question tempered solution accuracy: Those involving quotitive division (Q5 & Q6) were more difficult than
simple                          proportion        questions                   (Q1-Q3).        Simple                   proportion                              problems     were           more            difficult       when           the         dimensions
changed (Q4).

Discussion
                                This study's findings support NCTM's (2000) recommendation for deeper conceptual learning and
instruction of mathematics concepts. Our data do not support the notion that small problems are solved more
accurately than large problems. Actually, our results showing no differences due to base ratio suggest that the
dimensional and relational structure of multiplicative concepts impose greater constraints on response accuracy than
problem size does for 3rd and 5th grade students. This is substantiated by differences in the effect sizes of the tested
models and the finding that difference in mean accuracy between Q1 and Q3 were not large enough to invalidate the
test of the model to the data even though that difference was a function of number magnitude (i.e., 5 vs. 10). Finally,
the accuracy means of the division questions were nearly identical, [Q5 (M = 2.31, SD = 2.10) and Q6 (M = 2.38, SD
= 2.04)]. This finding counters the idea that division-with-remainder is more difficult than simple division. Future
research will evaluate the relation between conceptual structure and students' strategies, reasoning, students' tool
(graph, table) use in learning, and teachers' use of tools in ininstruction.
