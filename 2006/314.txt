         Abstract. This    field study    investigated the  application   of  cooperative,  competitive,  and
         individualistic goal structures  in classroom  use of  educational   math games   and its impact on
         students' math performance and math learning attitudes.    124 5th-grade students were recruited and
         randomly  assigned   to a Teams-Games-Tournament         cooperative, interpersonal competitive,  or
         individualistic gaming   condition.     A  state-standards-based math  exam    and an inventory  on
         attitudes toward mathematics were used in pretest and posttest.   Students' gender, socio economic
         status, and prior math ability were examined as the moderating variables.      Results indicated that
         gaming in cooperative    goal   structure was most effective in  promoting  positive  math  attitudes
         while classroom   goal  structure   for gaming had    no significant impact on  students' math   test
         performance.    It was also found that students of different socio-economic statuses were influenced
         differently by the gaming conditions.

Introduction
         Educational researchers have proposed computer game as a powerful mathematical learning tool with great
motivational appeal and multimode representations (Betz, 1995; Malone, 1981; Moreno, 2004).        Scholars such as
Rieber (1996) and Prensky (2001) theorized that games can serve as a vehicle for both play and imitation, two
functions that Piaget (1951) considered crucial for a child's intellectual development. There were also a few
empirical studies (Ahl, 1981; Okolo, 1992; Ota & Dupaul, 2002) showing that games can be effective tools for
engaging math learners or supplementing the instruction of arithmetical concepts understanding and problem
solving.

         However, more researchers contended that the effectiveness of computer game on learning is still a
mystery.  The findings were often contradictory and the evaluations anecdotal or descriptive (Randel et al. 1992).
The strict review of gaming studies conducted by Randel and his colleagues (1992) reported that among 68 studies
regarding the effectiveness of games in terms of student performance compared with traditional classroom
instruction, 38 (56% of the studies) found no difference, 22 (32%) found differences favoring games in student
performance, and 5% found differences favoring conventional instruction.      Similarly, the other three major reviews
on educational games (Dempsey, et al. 1996; Emes, 1997) found no clear causal relationship between academic
performance and the use of computer games.       These gaming literature reviews indicated that educational researchers
were still perplexed on how to incorporate computer games effectively into learning environment.

         In an effort to solve the puzzle on the instructional use of computer games, some researchers (e.g., Almory,
et al. 1999; Dempsey et al, 2002; Garris, et al. 2002; Rieber & Matzko, 2001) started the exploration of effective
game characteristics design or game selection for learning purpose.  Their research focused on more theoretical
conjectures than field evaluations or in-situ implementations.

         Differently, other researchers (e.g., Miller, et al., 1999; Papert, 1980) asserted that the investigation on
computer games for learning should focus on how games can be carefully aligned with sound pedagogical strategies
or learning conditions to be beneficial. Miller et al. (1999), Kaptelinin and Cole (2002) indicated that learning
outcomes achieved through educational games depend largely on the instructional activities context that structure
the way students use and interact with computer games.   Consistent with this proposition, the investigation of game-
based learning within alternative classroom goal structures ­ cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning ­
becomes valuable (Johnson & Johnson, 1996).

Theoretical Framework
Effects of Goal Structures on Learning Achievement
         The dynamics of classroom interactions is often an important feature in student motivation (Murphy &
Alexander, 2000). One important example of the importance of social interactions is classroom goal structure ­ "the
ways in which students will interact with each other and the teacher to achieve the goal" (Johnson & Johnson, 1999,

                                                           314                                                ICLS 2006
p. 3). Specifically, there are three choices in goal structure: cooperative, competitive, and individualistic. A
cooperative goal structure is one in which learners perceive that they are working together with other students to
gain rewards. A competitive goal structure is one in which learners perceive that they will be rewarded based on
comparisons with other learners. An individualistic goal structure is one in which learners perceive themselves as
working for their own rewards.

         A host of research was conducted on the relative effects of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic
modes of learning (Johnson & Johnson, 1994).   Johnson and his colleagues (1981) conducted a meta-analysis of 122
studies related to classroom goal structures and concluded that cooperation is considerably more effective than
interpersonal competition and individualistic efforts in promoting achievement and productivity.

         However, few of these studies have been conducted in the setting of computer-enhanced instruction.       Bahr
and Rieth (1991) did a study related to the impact of classroom goal structures in computer-based drill-and-practice
on high school students' math performance, and found no significant effects of goal condition.   Hence, it is
necessary to reexamine the influence of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic goal structures within a
computer-enhanced instructional setting.

Learning Effectiveness of Educational Games
         Use of computer games in education is widespread.    Researchers (e.g., Amory et al, 1999; Betz, 1995;
Malouf, 1988; McDonald & Hannafin, 2003) have conducted empirical research on computer games as an
instructional tool. Dempsey and his colleagues (1996) reviewed some 100 articles related to instructional gaming.
Randel and his colleagues (1992) conducted a meta-analysis of 68 gaming studies.   These researchers found
contradictory results concerning games' educational effectiveness. A possible reason is that the past gaming studies
vary in goal structures for treatment gaming (e.g., cooperative or individualistic) and evaluation for learning
outcome (e.g., cognitive performance or affective motivation).  Thus, a study examining the effects of gaming
within different goal structures on both cognitive and affective learning outcomes is warranted.

Educational Games in Different Goal Structures
         Despite the large number of studies about the use of classroom goal structure alone and instructional game
alone, studies combining these two variables are very limited. A recent review revealed only four related
investigations (Leemkuil et al, 2003; Levy, 1990; Strommen, 1993; Tanner & Lindquist, 1998).     Only two addressed
the issue in K-12 math education settings. Closely related to the current study was Strommen's (1993) investigation,
which examined 28 pairs of fourth graders using a cooperative and competitive educational computer game.         In the
cooperative condition, two students sat before one computer and played the game against the computer.   In the
competitive condition, each person had one computer and played the game against each other.      The cooperative
environment resulted in more correct answers than the competitive environment.

Teams-Games-Tournament Cooperative Learning Technique
         Different from Strommen's research (1993), cooperative learning in this study was anchored in a
cooperative learning technique known as Teams-Games-Tournament (TGT) (DeVries & Slavin, 1976), not
previously researched in either meta analyses by Dempsey (1996) or Randel (1992).   As Slavin (1995) suggested,
TGT is a cooperative learning technique that has been widely investigated. Research (e.g., Ben-Ari, 2001; Slavin,
1995; Okebukola, 1985) indicates that TGT enhances students' academic achievement and attitudes toward the
subject matter. However, most of these studies have incorporated TGT in traditional, face-to-face games rather than
computer-assisted ones.

Confounding Factors
         Although social interdependent theory suggests individuals in a cooperative structure, regardless of gender
and ability, should experience enhancements in learning and attitudes toward a subject, there is evidence that the
level of enhancement may vary across moderating factors (Johnson & Johnson, 1994).    For instance, Johnson et al
(1993) determined experimentally that low and middle achievers benefited more from cooperative goal structure
than high achievers.  Similarly, De Jean and his colleagues (1999) compared the reactions of junior high boys and
girls to the same computer game and found that more boys were engaged by cooperative game-playing and group
problem-solving.    Similarly, Moreno (2002) reported that students with low prior knowledge and low computer
experience were helped most by the visual representations in the gaming situation. His finding on the role of

                                                          315                                                   ICLS 2006
computer experience points to another potential mediating variable ­ socio-economic status (SES). SES has been
related to computer experience level (Campbell, 1983) and hence may also mediate the effects of game-playing.

Research Purpose
       Employing a pretest-posttest experimental design, this study examined the effects classroom goal structures
for educational math gaming (TGT cooperative, interpersonal competitive, and individualistic gaming) on 5th
graders' cognitive and affective learning outcomes (standards-based math exam performance and math learning
attitudes). Students' gender, socio-economic status, and prior math ability were considered as moderating variables.

Method
Participants
       One hundred twenty four participants were drawn from eight 5th-grade public school classes in central-
Pennsylvania.  Participants varied in gender (48% female) and socio-economic status (42% economically
disadvantaged).  All participants knew basic computer skills and had hands-on game-playing experiences in or out
of class before the experiment. Participation was voluntary.

Materials
       ASTRA EAGLE, a series of web-based computer games developed by the Center for Advanced
Technologies of one sampled public school district in central-Pennsylvania, was used in this study. The games were
designed to reinforce academic standards for mathematics required by "Pennsylvania System of School Assessment
(PSSA)," a standards-based criterion-referenced assessment required by all public schools in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

       These games contained a variety of tasks targeting math concepts comprehension and skills application,
including computation and estimation, adding and subtracting measurements, comparing quantities and magnitudes
of numbers, and mapping X and Y coordinates.    Most tasks were contextualized in meaningful stories relevant to
school students. For example, in a game called "Up, Up, & Away", game players had to travel by balloon.    One
problem they met was to estimate the traveling speed, "If your balloon was traveling at 14 miles per hour and then
sped up by a factor of 2 and then added another 1 miles per hour, how fast would it be traveling?"  Another example
was the task of locating X and Y coordinates in a game called "Treasure Hunt", where game players could follow a
hint "Go to X15, Y3 on the map and dig for treasure" to win game credits.     Immediate feedbacks were provided
upon students' responses. Each game had multiple levels.    To "conquer" a lower-level and "bump up" to higher-
level one, students needed to answer all questions of that level correctly. The more levels one conquered, the higher
score he/she earned.

Instruments
       A web-based, 30-item multiple-choice "Game Skills Arithmetic Test (GSAT)" was researcher-developed
based on the PSSA.   It measured math skills that the games reinforced, including "adding and subtracting
measurements," "comparing quantities and magnitudes of numbers," and "locating and identifying points on a
coordinate plane" (Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2004).     A panel of 5th grade math teachers from the
sampled school district vetted its content validity. The GSAT was piloted with 548 5th grade students during the
previous academic semester.   KR-20 reliability was .80.

       Tapia's "Attitudes Towards Math Inventory" was modified for a 5th grade audience (ATMI, Tapia &
Marsh, 2004).  This web-based, five-point Likert-scaled inventory contained 40-items investigating students' self-
confidence, value, enjoyment, and motivation toward mathematics.     This inventory reliably measured math attitudes
with a Cronbach alpha of .97.

Procedure
       Gender, socio-economic status, and previous PSSA math section percentile scores were collected prior to
the treatment. The teachers administered the GSAT and ATMI as a pretest.       Participants were randomly assigned by
intact classes to one of three groups: Teams-Games-Tournament cooperative gaming (n = 43), competitive gaming
(n = 41), and individual gaming group (n = 40).

                                                           316                                                ICLS 2006
       Participants took two orientation sessions (40 minutes each) during which they read the guidelines and tried
each web-based game.  They were then required to play one math game during two 40-minute sessions each week
for four weeks. Participants were seated in their own classrooms, each with an Internet-connected laptop.  The
teachers administered the treatments, setting up in-class game-playing sessions and monitoring participants'
activities. The teachers also had a one-hour training session and were given administration job-aids. The
researchers observed most game-playing sessions.

       For the TGT cooperative group, a close simulation of the TGT structure was used.     Specifically, students
were stratified by their math ability level and gender, and then randomly assigned to a four-member team.  At the
beginning of each game session, students collaborated for 10-minutes in pairs, practicing with the game, discussing
questions and solutions, and correcting each other's misconceptions.   For the remainder of the 30 minutes, class
teams then competed against one another; each team member held a laptop and was assigned to a tournament table
to play against other teams' representatives. At any tournament table the students were roughly comparable in
achievement level. At the end of every two gaming sessions, the players at each table compared their gaming scores
to determine their rank order which was then converted into points.   The points that the players earned were added to
compute a team score. The individual and team scores were ranked and listed in a newsletter, and distributed to the
class at the beginning of every treatment week.  In the newsletter, individuals were identified by pseudo IDs known
only to themselves and their teammates.

       During competitive gaming sessions, students were seated at their own desks and played games against the
computer.   At the end of every two gaming sessions, individual scores were compared against others in the class.
Their individual percentile ranks, identified by their own names, were announced in a newsletter every week.

       Similarly, students in the individualistic gaming group were seated at their own desks and played games
individually. However, there were no individual performance comparison or ranking for their gaming performances.
Finally, at the end of the four-week experiment, all participants took the post GSAT and ATMI.

Findings
       Because the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson's r = .388) for the two dependent measures was far
lower than .7 (Huch & Cormier, 1996), univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted separately on
the post GSAT and the ATMI scores to determine the main effect of gaming goal structure and the mediating
influences of gender and socio-economic status (economic-disadvantaged and normal).     Pretest scores and
participants' previous PSSA math section percentile scores (as the index of prior math ability) were used as
covariates.  The prerequisite homogeneity of was confirmed before the ANCOVA was used.       Descriptive statistics
are presented in Table 1.

       The ANCOVA test on participants' GSAT math exam performance did not show significant effect of
gaming goal structures (F = .26, p = .78). However, the other ANCOVA test indicated that gaming goal structures
have a significant impact on ATMI math attitudes (F = 3.93, p = .02).   Post hoc pair-wise comparison demonstrated

                                                           317                                               ICLS 2006
that cooperative game playing promoted significantly more positive math learning attitudes (Mcoop = 79.3) than the
competitive and individualistic groups (Mcomp = 74.7; Mindi = 75.4; pcomp = .01; pindi = .04). No significant
differences were found between the competitive gaming group and the individualistic gaming group (p = 0.70).

       The test results also indicated a significant interaction effect between the gaming goal structure and socio
economic status on participants' math learning attitudes (F = 3.85, p = 0.02). Specifically, economic-disadvantaged
students gained more positive attitudes toward math in cooperative game-playing conditions than in the other two
conditions (Mcoop = 81.4, Mcomp = 71.8; Mindi = 74.9). For economic-normal students there were no significant
differences between the three gaming situations in promoting positive learning attitudes.

       Besides, the study showed that educational math gaming, regardless of goal structure difference, generally
enhanced boy students' math learning attitudes more than that of girl students (Mboy = 78.0     Mgirl = 74.9, p = 0.05).
But there was neither significant main effect of gender on test performance no evident interaction between gender
and the treatment on both two learning outcomes.

Implications and Contributions
       The most important implication of this work is to inform educational practitioners to be cognizant of the
need to select appropriate classroom management strategies in integrating educational games into school education.
As this study indicated, gaming goal structures, beyond the games themselves, yield significant effects on
participants' math learning attitudes. Consistent with McDonald and Hannafin (2003), this paper recommends that
educational practitioners use gaming within meaningful learning environments or tasks to promote learning.

       Additionally, this study provides helpful findings on using Teams-Games-Tournament technique within a
math learning setting. TGT cooperation is more effective than competition and individual condition in facilitating
positive math attitudes, but not in promoting math performance.  This discovery sheds light on one major
controversy on cooperative learning ­ whether cooperative inter-group competition is advantageous over
interpersonal competition (Reid, 1992).

       Finally, in this study, a potential trend showing the economically disadvantaged students in cooperative
game playing scoring higher in math attitudes than those in the other two conditions was evident.    This is an
interesting trend deserving further exploration.
