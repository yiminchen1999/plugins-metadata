        Abstract: Youth development is multifaceted. While educational researchers have paid attention
        to one or few of these foci, it is imperative to understand how our technologies influence the
        various  facets  of  youth  development.    We                           developed  the Positive          Technological               Development
        research    model   to detail the overall  impact                          of   a technology          on  youth.   We       present          a study
        describing    how   the PTD    model  illustrates                         the   impact  of      an    educational   technology,                while
        illuminating design areas that need to be revised.

Introduction
        It is well acknowledged that computer technologies can be used to support youth's cognitive, social, and
personal developmental concerns. For example, researchers have shown the potential of Lego Logo programming in
facilitating young   children's development   of   problem                          solving,   hypothesis         testing, and         abstract        thinking skills
(Rogers &    Portsmore, 2004).   Other   researchers  have                         demonstrated         successful   use   of computer                 technologies in
promoting    youth's confidence,  motivation, and   sense                         of  efficacy (Dede          &  Ketelhut,  2003),              in bringing  together
entertainment and learning to promote motivation and interests (Barab, Thomas, Dodge, Carteaux, & Tuzun, 2005),
and in encouraging    collaboration   and meta-cognitive                          thinking  (Bers,      New,     &  Boudreau,                 2004). Taken   together,
these and many other research studies have shown that computer technologies can function as more than just a
cognitive manipulative; computer technologies have the potential to affect many facets of youth's development.

        Although the field of research in the learning sciences acknowledges the multifaceted nature of learning
with technologies, policy makers and practitioners often fail to see these connections. We suggest that this may be
partly because research reports in the field of technologies and learning sciences have largely been one-dimensional;
that is, individually, researchers have focused on just one of the many youth developmental concerns.

Positive Technological Development
        Guided   by   a research  model   from    applied                         development   sciences          termed   Positive             Youth   Development
(Lerner et al., 2005), which is a systems approach to youth development, we developed the Positive Technological
Development     theoretical model   that  details the            multi-faceted                nature          of youth   development                 and educational
technologies.   The  Positive  Technological  Development                             model  looks       at    six variables        that        have   been  deemed
important development concerns in the youth development literature (Scales et al., 2000). These six variables are
Competence, Confidence, Connection, Caring, Character, and Contribution. Given the growing concern for bridging
the gap between learning, educational technologies, and youth development, it is imperative that researchers who
hope to promote positive development in children and adolescents pay attention to these developmental concerns
(see Figure 1).

                                                    Caring (X30)                                 Technology            Caring (X31)

                                                                                                 intervention

          In order to understand these developmental variables in the context of technology and learning, we have
also developed the Positive Technological Development Questionnaire, which assesses these six variables in detail.
This poster presents our Positive Technological Development model and describes a research study as a case study
that exemplifies how this model and this questionnaire apply to research in the context of technology and learning
sciences.

Case study: Lego robotics workshop
          Thirty-seven children in the first and second grades participated in this research study with their parents.
The workshop was designed to teach participants basic Lego robotics building and programming skills using the
RoboLab©     software.  Both    parent  and child   participants received  instructions  on  Lego  robots  building   and
programming. Each parent-child pair worked on their own project throughout the workshop. Children participants
completed  the Positive   Technological   Development    questionnaire   before and  after the workshop.  Differences   in
scores related to the six variables were interpreted as changes due to the workshop. Table 1 summarizes the results
of the questionnaire with t-tests for significance.

 Developmental Variable      Difference (std. dev)       t       Developmental Variable     Difference (std. dev)    t
       Competence                  1.19 (.69)        10.38**          Connection                -0.35 (1.00)       -2.11*
        Confidence                 0.43 (.42)        5.01**              Caring                 0.11 (1.14)         .58
          Character                0.05 (1.64)         .19           Contribution               -0.19 (0.81)        -1.42
  Note. *p < .05. **p < .01.

          As table 1 illustrates, participants indeed  increased   their perceptions  of competence   and confidence    in
technological  abilities. However,     connection,  which  indexed   participants' perception   of the extent  to   which
technology   influenced   their social connections  with peers,  decreased  after the workshop.  This  could be    because
participants worked in pairs with their parents and the workshop curriculum did not encourage children to work with
other peers. The PTD analysis model successfully demonstrated that, although the goal to teach participants skills in
working with Lego robotics was reached, the workshop might have resulted in participants feeling less connected to
peers when using the technology. Thus, the curriculum may need to be revised to address this important issue.

Conclusions and Implications
          Our case study illustrated the importance of looking at the many facets of youth development when we
develop technologies as a learning tool for young people. While it is important to set priorities as to which aspect of
youth development (cognitive, social, or personal) our technologies may have the greatest impact, it is imperative to
also examine   how   our  technologies   may   influence   other aspects of development.    The  Positive Technological
Development theoretical model and questionnaire are tools designed to help researchers get a sense of how their
technology may influence the various developmental concerns in youth. Using this model and questionnaire can
guide researchers in their continuing effort to revise and develop their technologies and curricula.
