         Abstract:    Two    experiments     tested  the   effects  of   a framework    for promoting     productive
         collaboration and transfer.      The framework uses the dimensions of innovation and efficiency to
         characterize learning tasks according to the types of knowledge they should promote.             Innovation
         tasks  involve  the construction    of  novel  solutions  to  unfamiliar problems   while   efficiency tasks
         feature  repeated   application   of optimal   solutions.     The  former are    intended to help   students
         appreciate key features of an expert solution while the latter aim to increase speed and accuracy.
         The overarching hypothesis was that having an opportunity to innovate would promote productive
         collaboration and learning more than efficiently copying and studying correct answers.             The first
         experiment,    involving third   graders,   found  benefits  of  innovation  for individual  learning.   The
         second,    with   university students     working   collaboratively,   found   effects   of  innovation  on
         interaction.

         Traditional  instructional   activities often  emphasize    efficient drill-and-practice  methods   to the neglect  of
greater exploration and guided discovery.       Procedural mastery and the ability to apply one's knowledge with speed
and accuracy    are important   benefits  of  efficient approaches    to instruction  (Anderson,   Conrad,  &   Corbett, 1989;
Klahr  &   Nigam,   2005;   Tennyson,     Park,  &   Christensen,   1985).   However,     without  opportunities  for broader
exploration, deeper understanding arising from opportunities to integrate new concepts with prior knowledge and
from chances to notice invariant features of a problem may be lacking (Schroth, 1995; Schwartz & Martin, 2004;
Vollmeyer, Burns, & Holyoak, 1996).        For these reasons, Schwartz, Bransford, and Sears (2005) recently suggested
that a combination of innovation-oriented and efficiency-oriented activities might promote optimal learning.              This
proposal describes two tests of this claim--one in an individual context, the other in a collaborative context.           The
hope is that the innovation-efficiency framework may characterize optimal learning and instruction methods both for
individuals and groups.

         While the innovation and efficiency dimensions are still being empirically tested to determine their key
features, a basic characterization is possible.    Innovation tasks involve the use of prior knowledge to construct novel
solutions to unfamiliar problems.     Instructionally, these activities should help students understand the contexts and
key features of a problem.       Efficiency   tasks, by  contrast,  involve  repeatedly   applying optimal   solutions.   They
should promote speed and accuracy.

         Evidence for the importance of these dimensions to optimal learning came from recent work by Schwartz
and colleagues.     Schwartz  and   Bransford    (1998)    and Schwartz    and  Martin  (2004)  divided   students  into  three
conditions: one in which they attempted an innovation activity and then an efficiency activity, a second involving
only innovation activities, and a third involving only efficiency activities.      The innovation plus efficiency condition
did significantly   better  than the  other   two,  particularly   on  measures   involving transfer.   Thus,   Schwartz     and
colleagues provided evidence for the notion that innovation followed by efficiency promotes learning more than
either method alone.    Both of these studies involved high school or college students doing a math or a graphing task.
These   studies preceded    the  recent   explication   of the  innovation-efficiency     framework   and  contributed    to its
formulation.   The first experiment described below attempted to extend this work to other domains and populations
by  utilizing a reading  and concept-mapping       task with   third  graders.  In addition, this study explicitly tested the
innovation-efficiency   framework     for its effects   on individual  learning.   The hypothesis was that the innovation
condition, which    had  an opportunity   for greater   exploration   and  knowledge   construction   before receiving   expert
feedback, would show more learning than the efficiency condition.

         Going   beyond    individual  learning,   the  second   experiment    tested the  hypothesis  that  an  activity with
opportunities   for  innovation   would    yield   more    knowledge-sharing      and  productive    collaboration  than     one
emphasizing efficiency.     Why might we expect these dimensions to have different effects on collaborative learning?
First, informal  observations    from   an  innovative   statistics  task  suggested  that  students  were   very engaged    in

                                                               681                                                   ICLS 2006
generating, discussing, and testing potential solutions (Schwartz & Martin, 2004).           Second, other tasks showing
benefits of collaboration have features in common with innovative tasks (e.g. Laughlin, Zander, Knievel, & Tan,
2003; Schwartz, 1995; Steiner, 1972).    In each case, participants could build upon and revise each other's insights to
progress toward more effective solutions.   Finally, previous research has indicated that efficiency tasks such as list-
learning and copying, have negative effects or no benefits under collaboration conditions (Andersson & Rönnberg,
1995; Phelps   & Damon,    1989; Rummel     & Spada,   2005;   Steiner, 1972).  For these reasons, the innovation and
efficiency dimensions may offer a useful framework for characterizing productive collaborative tasks.

          If successful, such a framework could be beneficial to practitioners because teachers have found current
scaffolds  of collaboration difficult to implement  in their   classrooms   (Antil, Jenkins,  Wayne,   &  Vadasy,   1998).
Current approaches have tended to rely on social structures, such as motivational interventions (Johnson & Johnson,
1999; Slavin,  1996),  scripts and roles  (Coleman, 1998;    King, 1999;    O'Donnell,   1999),   and training (Gillies &
Ashman, 1998; Rummel & Spada, 2005) to achieve positive (and often impressive) outcomes.            The current approach
attempts to support behaviors associated with productive collaborative outcomes, such as explanations (Webb, 1983),
joint-attention and building dialogue (Barron, 2003), and metacognition (King, 1999), via the intrinsic demands of
the task.  In this way, the second study builds upon insights expressed by such distinct and notable scholars as
Cohen (1994) and Steiner (1972) to understand how different tasks may support or undermine collaborative learning.
This  is a topic that has  been relatively understudied and,   in  addition  to its practical  implications,  could  prove
informative to theory.  If the innovation-efficiency framework characterizes tasks that naturally afford productive
collaborations, then we can deepen our understanding of the specific collaborative behaviors that support learning, a
widely recognized goal for the field (Azmitia, 1996; Olivera & Straus, 2004; Slavin, 1996).

Study 1 Overview
          This study examined the hypothesis that an innovative activity would yield greater learning and transfer
than an efficiency activity even with equal time on task.    The study involved third-graders making a concept map
about energy transfer and computers.      Concept mapping    software   known   as  Betty's   Brain assisted  this process.
Betty's Brain is a teachable agent, so called because students teach it concepts and causal relationships in order to
learn (Biswas,   Schwartz,  Bransford,  &  TAGV,  2001).  Students      can ask Betty    questions  about the relationship
between concepts in their map as they make it, and Betty can respond by tracing through the causal-links in the map
to state how they affect each other.  In this process, students can reflect on what they have taught Betty and on their
own understanding.    Betty also can give students feedback on what percentage of their map is correct, allowing them
to check if they are on the right path.

          Over the two days of the experimental intervention, participants read two passages on energy transfer and
computers.    Each day, after reading the passage, participants in the Innovation condition used the text to create links
between the disconnected concepts provided in their Betty map.     Participants in the Efficiency condition were given
a list of all the pair-wise links so they could copy both the concepts and the links into their Betty map.         Figure 1
shows an expert version of the complete map.    One notable feature of this map is that each concept (except one--
Computer   Power)  had  a   technical name  and a  common      object associated    with it, such  as Mechanical    Energy
(Dancing) and Chemical Energy (Brain).

                                                           682                                                   ICLS 2006

Methods
         Participants--Thirty-four third-graders from a suburban parochial school were randomly assigned to one
of two conditions, Innovation versus Efficiency.    One student was absent from the Efficiency condition at posttest,
so a total of 33 participants completed the study.

         Procedure and Design--Table 1 outlines the study procedures and materials.       It shows the activities that all
participants did, regardless of condition. For the intervention days, the experimenter started by reading that day's
passage aloud to the participants as they read along silently. Then the participants made their maps; each working at
their own computer.     Because some participants did not create a perfect Day1 map, a correct concept map from
Day1 was provided to every participant on Day2, so that they could build upon it with the new links and concepts
they received that day.  As on Day1, this map included the Day2 nodes in it for the Innovation participants, and it
was their job to use the text to determine how to link them together and to the original Day1 map.   Efficiency Dyads
received a list of all the new pair-wise links and had to copy them into the Day1 map along with the new concepts.
To restate, the difference between conditions was that the Innovation participants had the opportunity to search and
find the appropriate links between  concepts  from   the text  before  checking Betty's Brain for feedback  while    the
Efficiency participants were given the answers on a sheet of paper to copy into their map and study if time permitted.
Both conditions utilized the full class periods to create their maps.

         Performance on the Betty map-making task served as an initial learning check.     The posttest consisted of a
quiz and map re-drawing task.   The 13-item short-answer quiz included three questions from Day1 materials, six
from Day2, and four transfer questions.    The Day1 and Day2 questions were fact-recall questions such as, "What
vibrates in our ear that causes us to hear sound?"   Three of the transfer questions required explanations that were
meant to reflect participants' understanding of the passage and whole concept map.      One question stated, "Imagine
an amazing invention was recently created--frictionless motors and wires!      How would this affect your computer?
Would any part of the computer become less important?"     The fourth transfer question consisted of three parts, each
requiring participants to state how different concepts in a new map affected each other.   It is important to note that
these were not questions designed to measure spontaneous transfer (e.g. Gick & Holyoak, 1983); rather, they were
designed to measure participants' ability to apply their previous learning in new contexts or to solve novel problems
(e.g. Schwartz & Bransford, 1998).

         The map re-drawing task required participants to draw the complete concept map on paper from memory.
The maps were scored as the percentage of all the possible relationships that could be traced in the expert map that
their map could answer correctly.  The visual layout of participants' redrawn maps had no relevance to the scoring
procedure.

Results
         As shown    in Figure 2, no significant   differences  were   found between conditions   on any of the map
measures.  Participants scored similarly on their Betty maps, suggesting that neither group started with an advantage

                                         Unlike the map measures, the 13-item quiz revealed a number of differences between the conditions, as
shown in Figure 3.                                  To score the quiz, eight of the questions were given one point if correct and zero if wrong.                                                                    Four
of the remaining questions had multiple parts, each of which received one point if correct and zero if wrong.                                                                                                          The
remaining                                  question  and        one       other  sub-question,          both from  the                             transfer  questions,         were         too        difficult for         the
participants, so answers that were relevant to the topic, though not necessarily correct, were given credit.                                                                                                      (If these
items were removed, the analyses would show similar results, though the difference by condition on the transfer
questions would be less significant t(31) = 1.3, p < .10 (one-tailed)).                                                                                If every question was answered perfectly, it
would be possible to score 24 points on the quiz, three points on Day1 questions, 13 on Day2 questions, and eight on
transfer questions.

                                         The Innovation condition scored significantly higher on the quiz than the Efficiency condition (t(31) = 2.8,
p = .009).                                 A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) using the three questions types (Day1, Day2, Transfer)
as the dependent measures revealed that Innovation scored significantly higher for Day2 questions (MS = 0.139,
F(1,31) = 6.6, p = .015), and marginally higher for Transfer questions (MS = .109, F(1,31) = 3.3, p = .079).

Conclusion
                                         As expected, the Innovation condition showed greater learning and transfer than the Efficiency condition
while performing similarly on map-recall.                                                 The greatest differences were on Day2 and transfer questions.                                                       The lack
of a significant difference on Day1 questions may be due to students in the Innovation condition trying to use the
Betty                                 feedback  feature        to construct      their    maps       in guess-and-check                               fashion on           Day1 rather        than       relying   on         the
passage.                                  Clearly, this was not the desired form of "innovation."                   On Day2, students were restricted to seeking Betty
feedback twice, and observationally, they searched the text more that day.

                                         Some may suggest that the Innovation participants were bound to show better performance on the quiz
given that they read the text more than the Efficiency participants.                                                                               This may be true, but I suspect the approach to
the reading was equally important.                                            Specifically, Innovation participants had an opportunity, via greater exploration,
to connect their prior knowledge to the new concepts and relationships they read about.                                                                                                     Some evidence for this
comes                                  from  their map         re-drawings       where     they      showed   a  tendency                              to recall the         common          terms       more     than        the
technical ones (29 common terms recalled versus 12 technical) whereas Efficiency participants were more equal (23
versus 19).                                 In other words, Innovation participants often put the map into terms they understood.

Study 2 Overview
                                         Study  1  examined        effects       of    activities    with  an  emphasis                               on  innovation         versus         efficiency     on     learning
outcomes.                                  Study 2 investigated effects in a collaborative context.                                               This study tested the hypothesis that a task with
opportunities for innovation would cause more productive collaborative interactions and greater learning than a task
focused primarily on efficiency.                                             Dyads read a one-page passage about cholesterol.                                                   They also worked with the
"Betty's                                 Brain" concept         mapping      teachable      agent       (Biswas, Schwartz,                               Bransford,         & TAGV,           2001).       Participants
taught Betty based on the cholesterol passage (e.g., "Exercise decreases LDL").

                                                                                                            684                                                                                               ICLS 2006
          When creating their concept maps, dyads in the innovation condition had to determine the links between 16
concepts in the passage.   Dyads in the efficiency condition received a list of all 23 pair-wise links. They used these
links to make a completely connected map.

Methods
          Participants--Thirty-eight participants, mostly undergraduates, were paired and randomly assigned to one
of two conditions.  Ten dyads were assigned to the Innovation condition and nine to the Efficiency condition.

          Procedure and Design-- Table 2 summarizes the study design, including periods of work done together
versus alone.    The unusual component of this design is that students took two tests: one immediately after creating
their initial map, and one after they had a chance to learn a second time by reviewing an expert map and the passage.
This second test permitted an estimate of how well students were prepared to learn.       The map-making phase was 20
minutes for both conditions, and the map-revision time depended on how long it took for participants to revise their
Betty map until it matched the provided expert map (usually two to five minutes).         Dyads were videotaped while
collaborating.   Scoring   of participants' re-drawn  maps followed    the  same  method  as  in Study 1.  Quizzes were
scored as percent correct based on the number of correct items out of 12 possible.

Results
          Learning outcomes are presented first, followed by analyses of interactions, then associations between the
two.    A marginally  significant   difference in   gain-over-time from  Test-1    to Test-2 was  found in favor  of the
Innovation condition (Wilks' lambda = .90, F(1, 32) = 3.4, p < .10).        Neither condition significantly outperformed
the other on either test.

          Regarding group process, observations suggested that Efficiency dyads handed off answers from list-reader
to link-maker.   Innovation dyads, by contrast, often co-constructed their answers.     Transcript analyses add rigor and
further  insight to these  observations, but first, a description  of their setup.  The transcript included turn-by-turn
conversation.    It also included which link was created on which turn.       Because the map re-drawing assessment
involved the same links that participants created in their maps, it was possible to connect turn-by-turn conversation
around a link to learning and memory of that specific link.       To my knowledge, this is the only study to use such a
fine-grained coupling of interaction-process and learning-outcome in its analyses, and it yielded some interesting
results. For example, this arrangement allowed a comparison of memory for links that were explained at some point
in dyads' discourse versus links that were not explained. (Explained links were recalled significantly more; however,
this effect was driven primarily by the Efficiency condition.)

          As expected, Innovation dyads took significantly more turns per link they created in their Betty maps than
Efficiency  dyads   (t(16) =  2.9, p = .01).   Efficiency dyads    averaged  less  than three turns per link (2.9 ±0.2).
Innovation dyads averaged over four turns per link (4.5 ±0.5).        At the micro-level, no significant correlation was
found between turns-taken on a link and successful recall of that link for either condition (r's between ±0.06).      In
other words, it was not the quantity of discussion around a link that determined dyads' recall of it.

          At the macro-level, greater discussion may have contributed to greater knowledge sharing, as measured by
similarity of partners' Map1 re-drawings.      Map1    similarity was  determined   by  summing   the number of  correct,
wrong, and missing links held in common by both partners in a dyad.            As one might expect, Innovation dyads

                                                            685                                                  ICLS 2006
showed greater Map1 similarity than Efficiency dyads, though only marginally (t(17) = 1.3, p < .10 (one-tailed)).
Across conditions, Map1 similarity was a strong predictor of gains on Map2 (partial correlations after removing
Map1 association with Map2: r's = 0.80 and 0.72, p's < .05 for Innovation and Efficiency, respectively).        In other
words,  greater knowledge    sharing was   associated  with greater  learning after revision.  (It is worth noting that
statistical analyses of  dyads    reduce sample  size  by  half; therefore, although  some  of  these  effects are   only
marginally significant, they still merit consideration).

Conclusion and Discussion
         The innovation and efficiency task structures were moderately successful at producing different interaction
patterns that appeared to have consequences for learning.   As expected, Innovation dyads showed greater discussion
during map-making than Efficiency dyads.       Efficiency dyads showed little discussion, averaging just 2.9 turns per
link. In other words, a typical interaction would involve one partner stating the link and the other copying it into the
map.   Not   surprisingly,  then, Innovation  dyads   appeared   to share knowledge   marginally   better, and this  was
associated with greater learning-gains following feedback.     The failure of the Innovation condition to significantly
outperform Efficiency after feedback is likely due to Innovation dyads generating errors in their initial Betty maps
(8.0 ±1.9 versus 0.3 ±0.3 for Efficiency).

         Two aspects of this study's design merit comment.       First, the tight coupling of interaction processes around
a link with memory for that link demonstrated a unique and powerful tool that could help us achieve the widely
recognized   goal of connecting   social processes  to learning  outcomes   (Azmitia, 1996;   Olivera &    Strauss, 2004;
Slavin, 1996).  Second, by assessing learning after innovation and again after revision, otherwise hidden differences
between conditions were found.     This opportunity to revise was a feature of tasks yielding successful collaborations.
Thus, cycles of innovation and revision may be an important feature of productive collaborative tasks.

         To summarize, the first study found benefits of innovation for learning on a transfer measure while the
second  found   effects on  interaction  that may  have   supported  learning after feedback.   It is possible  that  the
collaborative study would have also found differences in learning favoring the innovation condition if a transfer
measure was used, but this remains an empirical question.    Taken together, these studies provide preliminary support
for Schwartz et al.'s (2005) claim that opportunities for innovation before more efficiency-oriented instruction can
put students on a trajectory toward adaptive expertise (Hatano & Inagaki, 1986).        In addition, they provide initial
evidence that the innovation and efficiency framework may provide a useful characterization of tasks for promoting
collaboration--an aspect of collaborative learning that has been relatively understudied and could have significant
benefits for practitioners.
