         Abstract: This article presents a pilot study, which is part of a comprehensive project to examine
         the  impact     of epistemological   beliefs on  metacognitive    calibration during  learning  processes
         within a complex hypermedia information system. More specifically, this pilot study investigates
         (1) if learners differentiate between tasks of different complexity, set goals and plan accordingly
         and (2) whether such adaptive learning behavior is influenced by their epistemological beliefs.
         Students (n = 72) inspected a set of six learning tasks and answered multiple questions derived
         from the COPES-model of self-regulated learning (Winne & Hadwin, 1998), e.g. they judged the
         importance of specific learning strategies for a particular learning task. Furthermore, they filled in
         inventories measuring their epistemological beliefs. Results confirmed significant influences of
         task complexity and epistemological beliefs on students' judgments.

Introduction

Epistemological Beliefs and Learning
         Research on epistemological beliefs, i.e. learners' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing, has
expanded considerably in recent years (see, for overviews, Buehl & Alexander, 2001; Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). One
important theoretical assumption in these fields of research is that learners' epistemological beliefs develop from
more "naive" views (e.g., knowledge is absolute; knowledge is an accumulation of facts) to more "sophisticated"
beliefs (e.g., knowledge is relative and contextual, knowledge is a complex network) during educational processes.
An increasing number of empirical studies show that more sophisticated epistemological beliefs are related to more
adequate   learning strategies  and   better learning  outcomes.   To   give some    examples  from traditional  classrooms:
college  students'  epistemological    beliefs   influence   their processing   of   information and  their    monitoring of
comprehension     (e.g., Schommer,    1990),  their academic   performance    (e.g., Schommer,   1993),  conceptual   change
(e.g., Mason    & Boscolo,    2004),  cognitive  processes   during  learning (e.g., Kardash   & Howell,    2000), and their
engagement in learning (e.g. Hofer & Pintrich, 1997). There are fewer studies concerning computer-based learning
environments, but their results are encouraging as well. Concerning learning with hypertext, Jacobson and Spiro
(1995) found that learners with more sophisticated epistemological beliefs were more able to learn and apply their
knowledge after using a hypertext system than students with simpler epistemological beliefs. Bendixen and Hartley
(2003) also found that epistemological beliefs are a good predictor of learning outcomes in learning with hypertexts.
Concerning    learning   with  other   new   media,   Windschitl    and   Andre (1998)   found   that students   with  more
sophisticated   beliefs     learned  more   with   constructivist  simulations  than    students  with   less   sophisticated
epistemological beliefs. Bartholomé, Stahl, Pieschl, and Bromme (2006) found that students with more sophisticated
beliefs showed a more adequate help-seeking behavior within an interactive learning environment. There is also
evidence   that epistemological     beliefs affect students' information   retrieval from  the Internet  (e.g. Hofer, 2004).
Nonetheless the exact functional relationship between epistemological beliefs and learning, i.e. how they exactly
exert their influence, still remains an open issue. Most recent views on epistemological beliefs and learning agree
that such beliefs are somehow part of metacognition (e.g. Hofer, 2004; Kitchener, 1983; Kuhn, 2000), but empirical
evidence to confirm these assumptions is weak.

COPES-Model of Self-Regulated Learning
         An encouraging theoretical background that helps to specify such a functional relationship is given by the
COPES-model      (e.g.   Winne  &   Hadwin,   1998,  see figure  1  for a visualization) that  incorporates epistemological
beliefs as an important condition for the whole learning process. According to this model, self-regulated learning
occurs  in four   weakly    sequenced  and   recursive   stages: (1) task  definition, (2) goal  setting and   planning,  (3)
enactment and (4) adaptation. In the task definition stage (1), a student generates her own perception about what the
studying task is, and what constraints and resources are in place. An important product of this stage is the student`s

                                                              529                                                   ICLS 2006
perception of the goal of the task. Based on this personal definition the student generates idiosyncratic goal(s) and
constructs a plan for addressing that study task (2). In the enactment stage (3) the previously created plan of study
tactics is carried out. The adaptation stage (4) pertains to fine-tuning of strategies within the actual learning task as
well as to long-term adaptations based on the study experience. All four stages are embedded in the same general
cognitive architecture that can be described by five constituents whose acronym gave the model its name: conditions
(C), operations (O), products (P), evaluations (E) and standards (S). In the center of this architecture are processes of
metacognitive monitoring and controlling that students' might use to calibrate their learning process to perceived
demands   of the   learning  task.  If and how  such   metacognitive   calibrations   might    occur depends    on   the five
constituents of the cognitive architecture: Conditions pertain to external task conditions (e.g. time, resources) as well
as to internal cognitive (e.g. prior knowledge, motivation) conditions. Epistemological beliefs are a part of these
learner-related internal conditions. Conditions influence the whole learning process, especially the operations and
standards. Operations include all cognitive processes (e.g. tactics, strategies) that learners utilize to solve a learning
task. In each learning stage, these operations create internal or external products. These include internal mental (e.g.
a mental model of how to solve the task) as well as external products (e.g. an essay or an observable behavior).
Students' goals  are  represented   as multivariate  profile of  standards. Standards   can   be described   as a profile of
different criteria that a students sets for the learning task (e.g. targeted time on task, level of understanding and
information sources). Evaluations occur during the whole learning process when a student metacognitively monitors
her learning process. These evaluations are based on comparisons between the intermediate products on the one
hand and her standards on the other. When she notices discrepancies she is able to perform metacognitive control by
executing fix-up operations.

Task Difficulty, Epistemological Beliefs, and Metacognitive Calibration: A Pilot-Study
        Based    on  the COPES-model       we hypothesize    that epistemological     beliefs influence all  stages  of  self-
regulated   learning  within  a hypermedia    learning  system.    More  specifically,  we     assume   that metacognitive
calibration processes are affected strongest, e.g. the calibration or adaptation to task complexity. To illustrate this
functional relationship between epistemological beliefs and self-regulated learning, imagine a learner in the stage of
goal setting and planning with a more naive belief that knowledge is simple and stable. As epistemological beliefs
directly influence the standards, the learner might probably set quite superficial goals (e.g. "The goal is archived if I
have learned the important facts."; "I can complete this task in a short time.") compared to a more sophisticated
learner who believes that knowledge is complex and relative. The epistemological beliefs also directly influence the
operations, thus a more naive learner might probably also plan (and later on use) rather superficial operations for
task completion (e.g. memorizing) compared to a more sophisticated learner who might plan strategies of deeper
elaboration. These differences might become even more pronounced in subsequent learning stages and with regard
to more complex tasks. Consequently, we hypothesize, that learners with more sophisticated beliefs should be better
in calibrating  to task  complexity.   Within a larger  project   (Bromme    &  Stahl,  2004)    we  will test  this general
hypothesis about epistemological beliefs as important predictor for calibration with regard to each stage of self-
regulated learning according to the COPES-model. Three main experiments are planned: one experiment will mainly
deal with the stages of task definition and of goal setting and planning, whereas the other two experiments will
investigate the  real learning  process,   including enactment    and adaptation. All   experiments     will have   common
elements: students   work with    a hypermedia  information   system  on    genetics, especially about  the  topic   "genetic
fingerprinting". They    have  to   complete learning  tasks  with  different levels   of complexity,   which     have   been
established based on Bloom's revised taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001). In this article we present the results of a
pilot study. Although one objective of this study was to develop and evaluate material, e.g. appropriate learning
tasks and a questionnaire measuring task definition, goal setting and planning, this pilot study also explored the

                                                             530                                                   ICLS 2006
following research questions:    (1) Do   learners differentiate   between  tasks of different   complexity   according  to
Bloom's revised taxonomy and do they plan their goals and strategies accordingly (i.e. do they calibrate to task
complexity)? (2) Is this calibration process influenced by epistemological beliefs? To investigate these issues we
operationalized calibration in the following way: We presented the participants with learning tasks that differed in
complexity according to Bloom's revised taxonomy. Good calibration was diagnosed when participants' subjective
judgments to items concerning task definition, goal setting and planning (e.g. judgment of importance of the strategy
"elaborating") showed a significant relationship with the objective taxonomy (e.g. ascending judged importance of
"elaborating" with ascending task complexity).

Method

Participants
        Seventy-two students of biology (35 males and 37 females) took part in this study. The mean age was 22.5
years (SD = 1.6). Selected recruiting ensured adequate prior knowledge in molecular biology and adequate learning
experience. On  average  the    participants studied  in the 4.9th semester biology   or  related majors   (SD =  1.8)  and
already attended 8.8 (SD = 2.5) of twelve possible courses in molecular biology. The level of ability was confirmed
by the results of a short knowledge test (8 points maximum; M = 7.4, SD = 0.9).

Materials

Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaires
Epistemological beliefs  were    measured    by   one domain-general    instrument,  the   EBI   (Epistemological    Beliefs
Instrument, Jacobson & Jehng, 1999), that measured students' general beliefs about the nature of knowledge and
knowing, and with two domain-dependent instruments, the CAEB (Connotative Aspects of Epistemological Beliefs;
Stahl & Bromme, submitted) and the DEBQ (Domain-specific aspects of Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire,
Hofer, 2000). Concerning these two instruments students' were asked to complete the items referring to the domain
of genetics. Although it was not possible to replicate the original factor structures in all cases, meaningful solutions
were obtained:  The    factor  solution  for  the EBI    encompassed   the  two   original factors  "certainty"   (7 items,
Cronbach's  = .76) and "simplicity" (7 items, Cronbach's  = .69) which explained 42 % variance. The solution for
the CAEB comprised the original two factors "texture" (10 items, Cronbach's  = .82) and "variability" (7 items,
Cronbach's  = .64) and explained 38 % variance. The solution for the DEBQ explained 36 % variance but differed
from the original factors. It consists of two new factors, which we labeled as "definitude" (9 items, Cronbach's  =
.74, e.g. "If scholars try hard enough, they can find the answers to almost anything.") and "accessibility" (6 items,
Cronbach's  = .58, e.g. "I am more likely to accept the ideas of someone with firsthand experience than the ideas of
researchers in this field.").

Learning Tasks
        We developed learning tasks for the topic of genetic fingerprinting that varied in complexity according to
Bloom's revised taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001). All six Types of Learning Tasks (or "TLT-categories") of this
hierarchical taxonomy were covered (i.e. in ascending complexity: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate,
and create). The construction and selection followed a cyclic process: first, textbooks and articles on the topic of
genetic fingerprinting were    examined.  Second,    two  experts  were introduced   to  the revised     taxonomy and  both
constructed independently several exercises for all TLT-categories. As a result, a pool of 100 learning tasks was
established. Third, the two content experts as well as three content novices, all deeply familiar with the revised
taxonomy,   categorized all    learning tasks according   to  the  TLT-categories  in   a  blind  trial. Divergence  in the
categorization was discussed by the raters and led to rephrasing or deletion of tasks. As a result a pool of 86 learning
tasks was selected. For the final selection, only six tasks in each TLT-category were chosen, resulting in a total of 36
learning tasks, i.e. six versions per TLT-category. One example of the lowest TLT-category "remember" is a purely
factual multiple-choice question, such as: "DNA is split by which procedure?. The most complex TLT-category of
"create" on the other hand demands new creations such as predictions (e.g. "What would happen if law would allow
the analysis of coding DNA in forensic medicine? Outline the most important consequences.").

COPES-Questionnaire
        We developed a questionnaire to examine students' assessments of the first two stages of self-regulated
learning, (1) task definition and (2) goal setting and planning. It was named COPES-Questionnaire after the model it

                                                             531                                                   ICLS 2006
was derived from (Winne & Hadwin, 1998). The construction of the questionnaire followed a cyclic process as well:
a pool of 124 potential items was directly deduced from the COPES-model and from articles about metacognition
and   learning                  strategies                  (e.g.          Garavalia                               & Gredler,                  2003;            Hadwin,                    Winne,           Stockley,                             Nesbit                   &  Woszcyna,                             2001;
Luyten, Lowyck & Tuerlinckx, 2001; Wild & Schiefele, 1994). Five experts successively edited this item pool. The
resulting prototype of the COPES-questionnaire consists of 46 items. Most of these items have to be rated on a 7-
point             scale.        According                   to          the          cognitive                     constituents                             of the        COPES-model                        they                     cover                  students'                  assessments                     on
conditions (headed by the question: "How important are the following conditions for the solution of the present
task?", students have to rate 10 external / internal conditions like interest or prior knowledge), operations ("How

students have to rate                                     18 items like newspapers, textbooks, facts and details, rules and procedures).

Procedure
                   All          participants                           were           recruited                      during                   regular           university-courses                            in                   biology                    and           received                   12               for
participation. They worked in group-sessions with a maximum of 12 students. During the session each participant
completed                      two           questionnaires.                               The                     first          questionnaire                             encompassed                      demographic                                        questions,                             the            three
epistemological beliefs inventories and a short knowledge test. The second questionnaire consisted of six learning
tasks each of which had to be evaluated with the COPES-questionnaire. Students were asked to imagine that they
would have to solve the tasks with help of a hypermedia-learning environment about genetic fingerprinting while
completing                     the          questionnaire.                            To   balance                               the six         tasks                   per           TLT-category,                              twelve                     different                  versions                   of   this
questionnaire were produced. Consequently, twelve participants judged each learning task. Each student evaluated
learning tasks from all six TLT-categories presented in random order in a blind trial.

Results

Do learners differentiate between tasks of different complexity according to Bloom's
revised taxonomy and do they plan their goals and strategies accordingly?
                   We           decided                    to          use           multiple  criteria                              to        examine                    the          first         question.                     At           first,        ANOVAS                       for            repeated
measurements were calculated for each item. They compared judgments, e.g. about the importance of "elaborating",
across all TLT-categories (Types of Learning Tasks) of ascending task complexity according to Bloom's revised
taxonomy. We decided to define  < .05 as significant because of the explorative nature of this study and found
significant differences with regard to all 46 items. This is a first indicator that students differentiated between tasks
of   different                  complexity.                            As  an          example                       the         results         for           the         12           items         used   to                    measure                    students                  assessments                     on
operations are displayed in table 1 ("ANOVA results"). Second, to scrutinize the relationship two independent raters
visually           inspected                  the          corresponding                     diagrams                                of       means             (see         figure                  2)  across                    the          six          TLT-categories.

reliability was 89 %. Both raters consistently classified 41 items.

        From   these  26 items  were   classified  as having  a clear ascending   or descending  trend,  i.e. a significant
relationship or covariance with the taxonomy (even if the trend was not always strictly ascending / descending for
all categories, see "processing critically" in figure 2A for an example). Further two items were classified as having a
specific trend. For example, "practicing" had a peak for the third TLT-category "apply" (see figure 2B). 13 items
had  no clear  trend, e.g. were   seen as   roughly   equally important   for all TLT-categories   (e.g.  "elaborating by
information-search", see figure 2C). Third, correlations between the objective task complexity according to Bloom's
revised taxonomy and students' subjective judgments concerning one item across all categories were computed (see
table 1, "correlation with taxonomy"). 34 item exhibited significant correlations. With regard to a practical relevance
of these correlations only correlation with a medium effect size ( .30) were seen as clear trends. This applied to 18
items. An overall comparison revealed that these 18 items showed clear ascending or descending trends over all
three criteria (see table 1, "final classification"). The remaining items showed a specific trend (3 items) or other
meaningful patterns (mostly that an item was seen as equally relevant for all TLT-categories). The first question can
therefore be answered affirmative. Students acknowledge task difficulty according to Bloom's revised taxonomy
and plan their goals and strategies accordingly.

Is this calibration process influenced by epistemological beliefs?
        Because of the explorative character of the study we tested different methods to investigate the effects of
epistemological beliefs  on calibration   processes.  We  defined     < .05 as  significant and    <  .10  as a trend. All
methods yielded significant results or trends for at least half the analyzed variables. In this paper we will present
results of one of these methods as an example. We calculated calibration indices by computing the Z-transformed
correlations between   Bloom's    objective revised   taxonomy    and students'   answers to one   item  across  all TLT-
categories. Therefore, a   strong positive  calibration indicates a disagreement   to a single  item, e.g. importance   of
"elaborating", on easier tasks and an ascending agreement on more complex ones. A negative calibration on the
other hand designates a reverse relationship: as tasks become more complex, the participants' agreement decreases.
A calibration index of zero characterizes a nonexistent linear relationship between the participants' evaluations and
objective task complexity.  To    explore  the relationship between   the epistemological   belief dimensions   and  these
calibration indices correlations were computed. We found significant effects or trends for 14 of the 18 items (with a
total of 24 effects). We describe exemplary results for the items with apparent trends pertaining to "operations":
Five of the seven items showed significant correlations. We found a significant negative correlation (r = -.25, p <
.05) between   calibration of "structuring"    and "simplicity"  (from  the EBI).  Therefore,  students   displayed  better
calibration when they believed in complex knowledge in general: the learning strategy structuring (e.g. producing
outlines, concepts maps, or tables) was judged to be more important in more complex tasks. With regard to the
learning strategy of "integrating" (e.g. writing an integrated outline from multiple sources) the correlations showed
superior calibration for students with the beliefs in unstructured and vague (dimension "texture" from CAEB, r =
.27, p < .05) and more ambiguous knowledge in genetics (dimension "definitude" from DEBQ, r = -.33, p < .01).
The learning strategy "memorizing / learning by rote" displayed a positive trend between "variability" (CAEB) and
calibration (r = .21, p = .08). Thus, the more students believed that knowledge in genetics is certain and unchanging
the higher were their calibration indices. This result may seem counterintuitive at first, but a scatter-plot revealed

                                                            533                                                  ICLS 2006
that students who believed that knowledge in genetics is relative and flexible had higher but negative absolute values
of calibration, and therefore judged the strategy of memorizing as less important with more complex tasks. Students
who   believed  that knowledge     is ambiguous    ("definitude"   from    DEBQ)   judged   the learning  strategy  of "critical
processing" (e.g. drawing independent conclusions) as more important in complex tasks than in easy ones and thus
calibrate their judgments better to task complexity (r = -.21, p = .08). The more students' believed knowledge in
general  to be  complex    ("simplicity"  from  EBI,  r  =  -.29,  p <.  05)  and  knowledge    in genetics  to be  ambiguous
("definitude" from DEBQ, r = -.31, p < .01) the better was their calibration for the strategy of "planning" (e.g. trying
to get an overview, planning strategies of time): planning was seen as increasingly important with more complex
learning tasks.  It  can  be  summarized   that the   second  question     should  be  answered    affirmative: the calibration
process is significantly influenced by epistemological beliefs.

Discussion
         This article presents a pilot study that is part of a research project to examine the effects of epistemological
beliefs on metacognitive calibrations during learning processes within a complex hypermedia system. Starting from
the COPES-model (Winne & Hadwin, 1998) we plan to examine the effects of students' epistemological beliefs on
all stages of a learning process in detail. The main goal of the pilot study was to develop the experimental material
for the main studies. Nevertheless the pilot study also gave first insights in students' metacognitive calibrations. We
explored the first two stages of the COPES-model: the stages of individual task definition and of goal setting and
planning.   The  first aim   of this  research was    to examine     if students   differentiated  between  tasks   of different
complexity according to Bloom's revised taxonomy and if they set their goals and plans accordingly. We used a new
questionnaire to examine this question and asked students to judge conditions, operations, evaluations and standards
for tasks with different complexity. Depending on the criteria, between 18 and 34 of the 46 items showed clear
ascending or descending trends, i.e. covariance with objective task complexity. The first research question could be
answered    affirmative:  the results clearly show    that students  do  monitor   task  complexity   and calibrate   their goal
setting and  planning    accordingly.  Furthermore,   even   the   results without    an apparent  trend are meaningful,     e.g.
students judged motivation and interest equally important for all learning tasks. Nevertheless, these results should be
seen as preliminary because the development and selection of experimental material that led to "noise" and variance
in the data, e.g. testing six different versions of learning tasks per category. Against this background, it seems even
more promising that consistent effects were found; probably the real effects were even underestimated. The second
aim of this research was to examine if these calibration processes were affected by students' epistemological beliefs.
We found clear effects even with this exploratory design, i.e. the reported calibration indices revealed consistent and
meaningful results. In general, students with more relativistic epistemological beliefs were better able to monitor
task difficulty and to better calibrate their goal setting and planning accordingly. Therefore, the second question
could be answered affirmative as well. Nonetheless, these results are highly explorative for two reasons: first, we
tested different questionnaires to measure epistemological beliefs (because of the development of material). A main
problem in research on epistemological beliefs is that it is often not possible to fully replicate the original factor
structures of the instruments. We found meaningful factor solutions for the CAEB and the EBI that were nearly
similar to previously found solutions. Only the dimensions used for the DEBQ were different from original ones and
therefore we decided to rename them. The second reason concerns the purely correlative nature of the investigated
relationship   between    epistemological   beliefs   and  calibration     to task  complexity.    Because   of  this  fact, no
directionality  of  this influence could   be  convincingly   diagnosed.      Instead of epistemological   beliefs  influencing
calibration to task complexity it could also be assumed that differential exposure to and experience with (molecular)
genetics and different tasks evoked the formation and reinforcement of specific epistemological beliefs (i.e. "I had to
memorize    lot of  facts about   DNA   in molecular     genetics. Therefore,   the   knowledge    in genetics  has to  be  very
certain."). In summary, there is a relationship between epistemological beliefs, monitoring task complexity and goal
setting and planning. But so far the exact nature of this relationship remains pending. Further, more experimental
studies with more valid epistemological beliefs inventories are needed. From these results it can be concluded that
students use processes of metacognitive calibration in the planning stages even before they actually start learning
(with a  hypermedia      system). It  can be  assumed    that subsequent      learning   processes are influenced.  Therefore,
epistemological beliefs as well as formulation of learning tasks (and corresponding task complexity) exert a strong
influence in earlier learning stages. Consequently, early stages of the learning process might be considered more
seriously for the design of (hypermedia) learning-scenarios. We can conclude that this theory driven pilot study
clearly  showed     that  the COPES-model       is  a suiting  framework       for investigating   the   relationship  between
epistemological beliefs, task complexity, metacognitive monitoring and calibration of goal setting and planning. All
results are very promising on the one hand but clearly only explorative in nature so far on the other hand. Further
experiments will investigate the research questions more deeply.
