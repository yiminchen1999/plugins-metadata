        The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of handheld gaming on student
        learning in mathematics. During the four-month instructional period, 50 2nd grade students from
        three classes used a handheld Skills Arena software program or paper-based flash cards under
        various  conditions   depending  on  their teacher's  preference.  Overall results proved    that the
        handheld game activity in the classroom was beneficial to students in learning mathematics,
        especially  for    low-ability students, regardless   of  gender  and ethnic  background.       In  a
        non­experimental, correlational analysis, the results reveal that handheld game scores and attitude
        toward mathematics correlated significantly to students' scores on a mathematic test.          In the
        results of a quasi-experimental control-group design with Repeated Measures, handheld gaming
        students outperformed    students    who   did not use  a handheld   game  on a mathematic      test.
        Additionally, handheld low-level students outperformed those who did not use a handheld game
        on the same test.

        Handheld devices in K-12 education have a great potential to improve teaching and learning.    The essential
value of a handheld learning environment is that every student has immediate access to a learning tool in a small and
mobile package (Norris & Soloway, 2003).     The high mobility of handheld devices enables students to be
lifelong­learners with no limit of time and place (Crawford, Vahey, Lewis, & Toyama, 2002; Norris & Soloway,
2003). Educational programs have been developed to attain maximum benefits from handheld devices in learning
activities such as game­based instructional programs.  Games have been incorporated in the classroom for learning
and understanding complex subjects.    A game is a set of rule-guided, goal-directed activities that have no real-world
consequences (Crookall, Oxford, & Saunders, 1987; Dempsey, Haynes, Lucassen, & Casey, 2002).         Essential
features in a game environment are authentic fantasy contexts, rules/goals, and challenges (Gredler, 1996; Thornton
& Cleveland, 1990). Game research proved that the game features enhance dynamic cognitive processes for
meaningful learning (Garris, Ahlers, & Driskell, 2002; Pillay, Brownlee, & Wilss, 1999; Rieber, Smith, & Noah,
1998; Rosas et al., 2002). The literature review of games and handheld devices has shown that there would be
promising benefits to student learning in handheld gaming environments.   The results of handheld game studies
proved that games on handheld devices are easy to use and allow learners to focus on activities because of the small
size of the handheld (Zurita, Nussbaum, & Sánchez, 1999).  However, there are very few studies about the use of
handheld games in classroom settings.  Empirical evidence regarding educational handheld games in classrooms is
insufficient to support favorable effects of handheld games on learning (Dempsey et al., 2002). Hence,
comprehensive empirical studies are needed to support the idea that handheld gaming can potentially have a
substantial impact on teaching and learning.

        The primary purpose of this study is two fold.  First is to explore what aspects of learners' characteristics
influence student learning in a handheld gaming environment.   Second is to investigate whether educational
handheld games could promote student learning.   The specific research questions of this study were:
·   What aspects of learners' characteristics (attitude toward mathematics, attitude toward a handheld game,
    handheld gaming performance, gender and ethnicity) influence student learning in a handheld gaming
    environment?
·   What is the impact of handheld games in the classroom on student learning, especially for female and
    low­ability students?

Methodology
Participants
       The participants of this study were 50 2nd grade students attending an elementary school near a large city in
the Midwest. The students were primarily upper middle class and Caucasian.       The 50 participants were from three
classes and included 28 male and 22 female students. The three classes had 21, 20 and 9 students, respectively.     The
ethnic composition of the participants was 31 Caucasians, eight Asians, six African Americans, four others and one
Hispanic. We lost one female student because she transferred to another school.

Materials
       An educational game program entitled Skills Arena was used in this study.      The program was designed to
teach students about basic arithmetic skills (such as addition and subtraction). The games were designed using a
handheld GameBoyTM.  In Skills Arena students can create their own character with their name for playing the game.
They are able to choose their game type and level based on their ability and learning goals. The game has several
options for speed level, game type and arithmetic task. Six speed levels, from the easiest to the most difficult, are
presented in the form of cartoon characters. The game types are mental, extension and place games.   The mental
game is the easiest, dealing only with single digit numbers such as "___ + 3 = 10".  The extension game is the
moderately difficult level game. For instance, "300 + 400 = _____, or 260 - 50 = ______".     The place game is the
highest level using multiple digit numbers such as "245 + 563 = ______, or 437 ­ 36 = ____."    Each game has three
options for arithmetic tasks which are addition, subtraction, and mixed addition and subtraction. The arithmetic
problems in the Skills Arena are composed of one, two, three, and four digit numbers.  Students have to solve the
problems before the questions fade out on the GameBoyTM screen.   As the students answer a question, they receive
immediate feedback as to whether they have correctly or incorrectly answered the question.    The game displays a
performance summary immediately after each game finishes.      The summary shows the total number of problems
solved, and the number of correctly solved problems in each game.  It also tells the total number of solved problems
and correctly solved problems in the games they have played over time (see Figure 1).

Treatment
Handheld Game Group
       The handheld game group (HG) was composed of the 20 participants in class two.        Students used a
GameBoyTM and the Skills Arena software program.     For the first ten days of the Skills Arena handheld gaming, the
students played the game for 15 minutes, five times per a week. After that, they worked on the Skills Arena
activities for 15 minutes, three times per a week during the five-week instruction. After five-weeks of game
activities, the students played the game for 15 minutes, twice per week for 13 weeks.  They were kept from playing
the game except for the period of handheld gaming activities.

Card Game Group
       The card game group (CG) consisted of the 21 students in class one.       Students used flash fact cards for
practicing basic arithmetic skills during a five-week instructional period. The flash fact card is a triangle shape that
has three numbers, one on each angle, and either an addition or subtraction sign in the middle of the card. Individual
students have their own cards. A pair of students was teamed up. One student held a card by hiding one of the three
numbers, and asked the other student what number was hidden on the card.      The other student in the pair answered
the question using the two remaining numbers and the arithmetic sign on the card.    They repeated the procedure with
all the cards that a questioner had and then they switched their roles once the questioner was finished with the cards.

                                                          703                                                  ICLS 2006
They exercised addition and subtraction flash card activities for 15 minutes, three times per a week. After five
weeks of flash card activities, the students used a GameBoyTM and the Skills Arena software program for the
remaining 13 weeks of the semester. The first ten days with Skills Arena, the class two activities were the same as
those of the HG. After that, they played the game for 15 minutes, three or four times per a week.  Further, the
students were also allowed to play the game anytime they finished their other class assignments.

Delayed Handheld Game Group
        The delayed handheld game group (DG) consisted of the 9 students from class three. Class three joined this
study ten weeks later after conducting a pre-test. Students used a GameBoyTM and the Skills Arena software
program for eight weeks. The directions for the handheld game activity were the same as those of the CG.

Measures
Mathematic Scores and Handheld Game Scores
        A 70 item instrument was developed to assess mathematics skills.       The test items were directly aligned with
the second grade mathematics curriculum standards of the participating school.    The test had two sections. Part I
consisted of 50 questions with 25 addition items and 25 subtraction items to measure basic arithmetic skills. Part II
of the test had 20 questions including 10 addition and 10 subtraction items to assess advanced arithmetic skills.
Face validity for this instrument was verified by the teachers at the participating school. The students took Part I of
the test in 15 minutes and Part II in 5 minutes. We administered this test before starting any gaming, after 5-weeks
and after 13-weeks of game activities.

        The Skills Arena game maintains a record of the total number of solved problems and the total number of
correctly solved problems in the games students have played over time.  Hence, the students' game scores could be
extracted from the summary page of the Skills Arena game when the mathematics test was administered.      The
students' game score is the number of correctly solved programs in the Skills Arena game.

Attitude Toward Mathematics and Attitude Toward Handheld Games
        The subjects' attitude toward mathematics was measured using the Attitude Toward Math Survey.         This
survey, developed by Pearce, Lungren, & Wince, was designed focusing on closely balanced representations of
positive and negative statements with respect to young students' attitudes toward mathematics (Pearce, Lungren, &
Wince, 1998).  The teachers presented 23 statements orally to students. The students responded by marking yes or
no to the statements on their answer sheet. Finally, an 8-item debriefing questionnaire was developed to capture
qualitative data regarding participants' attitude toward elements of the game such as the interface of the program,
the usefulness of the feedback for learning math, the sounds and colors of the game, the likeability of the game, their
attitude toward handheld games and additional comments.    The items were a combination of "Yes or No" and open-
ended questions. The participant teachers checked the readability of the items for second grade students. A
researcher conducted an individual interview with all the students in order to get participant responses on each item.

Procedures
        The study was conducted for a four­month period during the spring semester of 2005.       The pretest was
done under the supervision of teachers and two investigators before the handheld gaming instruction was given.
Two investigators conducted a one-hour training session for teachers and students before the handheld game use
began. Most students had previous experience playing games on the GameBoyTM. Students were able to play the
game with the basic guidelines we provided.

        During the five weeks of mathematics classes, all the students in the Handheld Game group (HG) used a
GameBoyTM and the Skills Arena software program.      In the Card Game group (CG), the students worked on addition
and subtraction activities using the flash cards for the same number of hours as the HG students.  After five­weeks
of instruction, the teachers and the investigators administered the posttest. After the posttest, all students in these
two groups used a GameBoyTM and the Skills Arena software program for 13 weeks following their teachers'
directions. After 10 weeks and conducting a pre-test, the delayed handheld group (DG) used a GameBoyTM and the
Skills Arena software program for eight weeks.    The teachers and the investigators administered the final test in the
three classes after the four-month handheld game instruction intervention.    Finally, the teachers administered the
survey of students' attitudes toward mathematics.

                                                           704                                                  ICLS 2006
          During the implementation stage of the handheld game, a researcher and an assistant researcher conducted
a classroom observation for the HG and CG classes twice a week.     During the five-week instruction, the main
purpose of the classroom observation was to ensure that the Skills Arena game was implemented in the handheld
game group as intended. For the flash card game group, the observation was to guarantee that students' arithmetic
skill practice hours would be the same as the handheld game group.   During the 13-week instruction, the classroom
observation was conducted to confirm that the handheld game students played the game constantly in an appropriate
way, and the Skills Arena game was precisely implemented in the flash card group.

Research Design and Data Analysis
          This paper includes two research designs and data analyses to investigate the impact of handheld games on
learning.  The results of two data analyses can support each other to validate the analysis and provide concrete
evidence to conclude the effects of handheld games on student learning.  In Research Design One, 50 students from
three groups (HG, CG and DG) were used for data analysis.   This was a non-experimental, correlational analysis of
the predictors of students' performance in mathematics. Multiple regression was used to test the relationship
between mathematics scores and the predictor variables including attitude toward the handheld game, attitude
toward mathematics, ethnicity, gender and performance with a handheld game (number of correctly solved
problems).

          In Research Design Two, 37 students from the two groups (HG and CG) were used for conducting data
analysis.  Three male students were excluded from the analysis because they did not take the pre­test.  During the
five-week instruction, the study provided information regarding the performance differences between the Handheld
and Non-Handheld game groups.        In the 13­week handheld gaming instruction, the results showed differences on
student learning based on the playing time of the handheld game.   This was a quasi-experimental control-group
design with Repeated Measures.      The data analysis for student performance was carried out as a Repeated Measures
with two groups (Card game and Handheld game) as a between factor, and Time of Measurements (pretest, posttest
and final test) as a within factor. Dependent variables were scores of the mathematics tests.

          The Repeated Measures was employed to analyze gender differences as well.     The analysis for low­level
student performance was conducted using a Repeated Measures with only low­level students from both of the
groups. The students were divided into low- and high-level groups based on their pretest scores.  The low-level
group consists of the students who had scores lower than 42 on the pretest.  The sample size of each low­level group
(n = 10 from HG and n = 11 from CG) was relatively small.   Assumptions for the statistical measures were checked
by the significant Levene's test for equality of variances among the groups. The data of the low­level samples met
the assumptions. The statistical analysis was interpreted to examine the effects of the handheld game on the
low­level students.  Additional information is provided by the effect sizes obtained from the differences of two
groups. Significance values given are *** (p < .001), ** (p < .01), and * (p < .05).

Multiple Regression Results
          To understand how students in the three groups performed on the mathematic test, descriptive analysis of
each group were conducted (see Table 1).    In order to detect multicollinearity among the independent variables, we
computed Pearson correlation coefficients for the entire sample.  There was no potential of multicollinearity among
variables. In the first step of the analysis, all the predictor variables, including attitude toward mathematics, attitude
toward handheld games, scores of handheld gaming, gender and ethnicity were entered into the model
simultaneously.  Only two variables, handheld game scores, ß = .42, t = 3.61, p = .001, and attitude toward
mathematics, ß = .39, t = 3.30, p = .002, emerged as significant predictors of mathematics test scores. In the second
step of the analysis, to reduce the error term associated with the inclusion of nonsignificant predictors in regression
models, we included only the significant predictors from the first regression analysis. In this step, attitude toward
mathematics, along with handheld game scores, was a significant predictor of mathematics test scores.    Handheld
game scores ß = .48, t = 4.32, p < .000, and attitude toward mathematics, ß = .40, t = 3.52, p < .001, accounted for
45% (p < .000) of the variance in mathematics test scores. Overall, students who had higher attitudes toward
mathematics and handheld game scores were more likely to achieve high scores on the mathematics test.      Attitude
toward the handheld game, gender and ethnicity were not significant predictors of mathematics test scores.  The
regression results from the first and second step analyses are summarized in Table 2.

         Violations of any assumptions of multiple regression analysis were checked in the overall plot and normal
probability plot of residuals. Overall results of the residual graphs indicated that the samples of this study met the
assumptions of multiple regression analysis and the multiple regression technique can be used to analyze the data of
the mathematics test. Finally, we used the technique of cross-validation to determine whether the prediction
equation has a chance of being successful when it is used with a new group of individuals.   The results confirmed
that the prediction equation of the mathematics scores works for students other than those who were used to develop
the equation.

Repeated Measures Results
           The results of the Repeated Measures show a significant Time of Measurement X Group effect F (2, 34) =
5.61, p = .008 in the total math scores.   It indicated that a statistically significant difference in the mathematics
scores' changes over time in the two groups (HG and CG).    In the five-week instruction with the handheld game
only for the handheld game group, the handheld game group (HG) outperformed the card game group (CG) from the
aspect of improving scores. The HG and CG groups had similar scores on the pretest at the beginning of the
instruction. The HG group scored higher than those of the CG group on the posttest.  The HG students gained 11%
(M = 7.65, SD = 7.84) from the pretest to the posttest. In the case of the CG group, students increased only 5% (M
= 2.90, SD = 6.46) on the tests. The effect size of the total gain difference between the two groups was .61.   In the
next 13-week instruction period with the handheld game for the both groups, the CG group outperformed the HG
group on gain scores. The CG students increased 11% (M = 7.65, SD = 6.15) from the posttest to the final test.          The
HG students increased only 1% (M = 0.82, SD = 6.54) on the tests.     The effect size of gain difference between the
two groups was 1.04 (see Figure 2).

           The results of repeated measures with only low-level students revealed that there was a significant Time of
Measurement X Group effect, F (2, 18) = 4.04, p = .036, indicating a statistically significant difference in the
mathematics scores' changes over time in the two groups as well.     The HG low-level students using the handheld
game gained 16% (M = 11.50, SD = 7.12) from the pretest to the posttest.    In case of CG group, students increased
only 5% (M = 3.45, SD = 8.34) on the tests.    The effect size of total gain difference between the two groups was .97.
In the next 13-week instruction period with the handheld game for the both groups, the CG low-level students
outperformed those of the HG group on gain scores.    The CG low-level students increased 12% (M = 8.18, SD =
7.64) from the posttest to the final test. The HG low-level students increased almost 0% (M = 0.30, SD = 7.32) on
the tests. The effect size of gain difference between the two groups was 1.03 (see Figure 3). However, there was no
significant result with respect to gender difference on the test.

Discussion and Implications
           The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of handheld gaming on student learning in
mathematics.   Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the handheld game activity in the
classroom is beneficial to the students, especially low-ability students, in learning mathematics regardless of gender
and ethnicity. It is consistent with previous research on handheld technology and games that indicates they could be
an effective tool for facilitating student learning (Cordova & Leper, 1996; Knezek, 1997; McFarlane, Sparowhawk,
& Heald, 2002; Rosas et al., 2002). Additionally, the results of analyses reveal that the students' scores on the
mathematics test were not different based on ethnicity and gender.    The gender difference was expected with the
hypothesis that the handheld game would be more favorable to female students because the game's nature was not
aggressive.  However, the t-test results of the attitude scores revealed that there was no significant attitude difference
toward the handheld game between 21 male and 16 female students.       Therefore, a general conclusion that the

                                                             707                                                 ICLS 2006
handheld game would equally influence student learning without bias of gender and ethnic differences could be
drawn.

        There are several key findings from this study.    First, on gain scores on the mathematic test, the students
who used the handheld-based arithmetic game outperformed those who did not use it.    Second, students who played
the handheld game more than four times per a week outperformed those who used the game only twice a week.
Also, on gain scores on the same mathematics test, low-ability students who had used the handheld game
outperformed those low-ability students who had not used it.   Lastly, the cumulative number of problems solved
correctly as indicated by the handheld game scores and the students' attitude toward mathematics significantly
correlated to the students' scores on the mathematics final test. Overall results prove that the handheld gaming
environment impacts positively on students' learning in mathematics, especially for low-ability groups.
Nonetheless, this study sample size was relatively small for conducting statistical analyses, especially gender and
ability-level analyses. The small sample size might skew the result.  Hence, more extensive study with a larger
sample size would be required to generalize the results of this study about the effects of a handheld gaming
environment on student learning in mathematics.
