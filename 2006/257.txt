         Abstract: Odyssey High School is small inner-city school within a school in a large urban center.
         Over its  five years  of  existence,  Odyssey     administrators in collaboration  with  a  set of  outside
         partners have been developing and implementing a school that focuses on project-based learning
         and supports its teachers in constructing interdisciplinary projects around the school's theme of
         environmental   science.   Findings  indicate that  older  students  at  the  school, who   were   with the
         school before  this   reform effort  began,  are  not as  vested in  the effort as are  younger    students,
         many of whom chose to attend the school for its science focus. It appears that positive gains in
         student self-efficacy and interest toward science have been achieved in the few years since the
         reform effort  has  been    commenced    but  there   are significant  challenges  remain   on  improving
         student sense of belonging and overall engagement with the school.

Introduction and Purpose
         Although there are important exceptions and some successful reform work that is underway, as a group
urban  high schools  often  fail to  meet  the needs   of  too many  of   their students,  particularly  in terms  of science
education. In many urban high schools with large concentrations of students who live in poverty, it is common for
fewer than half of the ninth graders who enter to leave with a high school diploma (National Research Council,
2004). Dropping out of school is but the most visible indication of pervasive disengagement from the academic
purposes and programs of these schools. Many of the students who do not drop out altogether attend irregularly,
exert modest effort on schoolwork, and learn little.

         Engaging adolescents, including those who have become disengaged and alienated from school, is certainly
not  an easy  task. Research   has   shown   that academic     motivation  decreases   steadily  from   the  early grades   of
elementary school into high school (National Research Council, 2004). Even though schools do not control all of the
factors that influence students' academic engagement these disadvantages can be lessened by an engaging school
community    with  high  academic    standards,   skillful instruction,  and  the support   students  need   to  pursue   their
educational and career goals (Fashola & Slavin, 1997; Teel, Debruin-Parecki, & Covington, 1998). Educators and
scholars have recommended       that large urban   schools   be  restructured   into small  learning communities,     teachers
engage students in inquiry-oriented learning processes, and focus on developing a sense of pride and ownership
among students regarding their school. During the previous three years we have been collaborating with Odyssey
High  School, a small   inner  city  high school,  to  restructure  its curriculum   and  develop  instructional   projects to
improve student academic engagement (Knapp & Plecki, 2001; National Research Council, 2004). The purpose of
this manuscript is  to  report the  outcomes   of our  work  during  year  two    of a five year longitudinal    research and
development study with Odyssey High and to share our findings with the larger educational research community.

Background

Urban Science Education
         The problems that urban schools face have been well documented (Knapp, 1997; Knapp & Plecki, 2001).
Teachers and students work under stressful conditions and often experience alienation. Students have high rates of
truancy,  low rates of  graduation, and  their achievement   levels are  lower than those of  their peers in non-urban
settings (Barton, 1998). In addition, teachers in urban schools are more likely to be underprepared and have limited
access to material resources (Darling-Hammond & Sclan, 1996; United States Department of Education, 2001). In
addition, teachers in high poverty urban centers, perhaps more strongly than any other group of teachers, face an
increased demand    for high  standards  across the  curriculum  with particular emphasis on  math   and  literacy  (Pew
Charitable Trusts, 1998). An immediate outcome of this policy is that the limited resources available in the district
or school are  funneled  into  math and   reading programs,    with few  resources, such  as time,  money, and  people
available to  support science. To   deal with  large classes and little equipment,  many  urban  teachers typically   use
whole-class instructional techniques (lectures, class reading, completing worksheets), in which students are passive
learners. This situation, it has been argued, often results in a "directive, controlling pedagogy" (Haberman, 1991, p.
291) known as the pedagogy of poverty. This in turn leads to poor achievement as noted by Teel, Debruin-Pareck, &
Covington,   (1998, p.  480)  in which   they  found  that "one  of the  most  important  causes of  African-American
students' low achievement in school is inappropriate teaching strategies", which make it difficult for them to reach
their full potential, thus alienating them from school.

Urban Student Academic Engagement
         There is substantial empirical evidence on the educational conditions that promote intellectual engagement.
The evidence suggests that the effect of the educational context on engagement is mediated by three sets of
psychological variables: (1) beliefs about competence and control, (2) values, goals and interests, and (3) a sense of
social and personal connectedness (National Research Council, 2004). Students tend to not exert effort in academic
related work if they feel that they lack the capacity to succeed or that they have no control over outcomes. In fact,
students' beliefs regarding their ability to succeed has a direct impact on their intellectual engagement (National
Research Council, 2004). For example, a few educational theorists have argued that students of color, especially
African-American youth, often develop anti-academic values because they do see any tangible return to school
(Obgu, 1997). Obgu and others have proposed that African-American youth do not expect their own success in
school to be rewarded. According to Ogbu African-American youth distance themselves psychologically from the
failure they believe is inevitable in an unfair society that is biased against them by disidentifying with academic
achievement value and by developing a strong identity that is "oppositional" to the dominant culture. This is
particularly troublesome in terms of science education because science and the corresponding mathematical skills
are often gatekeeper disciplines for social advancement in today's society (Sells, 1973). Thus, if students do not feel
that they can succeed in science it is more difficult for them to obtain a career that will allow them and their children
to transition out of poverty (Blustein, Juntunen, & Worthington, 2000). However, even if students believe they can
succeed in school, they won't exert effort unless they are interested. For example, research has shown that students
who are intrinsically interested in an activity are more likely than students who are not intrinsically interested to
seek challenging tasks and exert effort to learn and understand the material under study (Downy & Ainsowrth-
Darnell, 1999). Further, research has shown that students who feel a connection (either social or psychological) to
their schools often show more perseverance toward staying in school and achieving academically (Davidson &
Phelan, 1999).

Study Context
         Odyssey High School is a small learning community that occupies the third floor of a school building that
formerly housed an entire High School. Five years ago the building was split up into three separate schools that stay
largely separated, creating small school communities of less than 400 students. Odyssey High is one of these theme-
based (environmental science) small-schools with approximately 390 enrolled students. At Odyssey at least 14% of
the students are single parents with young children of their own; over 85% of the students are from racial/ethnic
minority backgrounds with 13% speaking English as a second language; 20% with disabilities; and all students are
from low-income families.

         To engage and motivate students, Odyssey provides a broad spectrum of experiences around environmental
science topics. Odyssey has chosen to focus on environmental science because "by focusing on the environment

                                                           258                                                ICLS 2006
students will be engaged in activities that foster and support a richer understanding of how school work can impact
and connect to their everyday lives" (Odyssey High School, 2003). In collaboration with community-based partners,
Odyssey has developed a series of innovative project-based environmental science programs designed to motivate
and   engage   students  in   studying   their  local  environment.    Odyssey    administration      and  faculty believe   that an
environmental science focus coupled with their new status as a small-learning community will improve students'
interest and confidence in science (particularly women) (Baker & Leary, 2003), decrease student attrition from the
school (Adamson, Foster, Roark, & Reed, 1998) improve student achievement, and increase students' self-efficacy
toward science.

Methodology

Data Collection
          Data  collection   consisted   of   a mixed    methodological   strategy.  First, a survey   designed    to measure    self-
efficacy,   interest toward   science,  math,   student   perceptions  regarding  gender    related   issues  in  science,  and their
sense  of   social belongingness    to  Odyssey      was  administered.   The   survey  consisted     of a total  of  60  previously
validated questions (Enochs, Smith, & Huinker, 2000; Riggs & Enochs, 1990). We surveyed 174 of the 390 students
with  132   of the   students being    the same     from pre to the  post survey.   Complementing        the quantitative   data, we
conducted focus groups with a random subset of students from each grade. Three focus groups from each grade (9-
12) were conducted twice during the school year, once near the beginning of the year and again at the end of the
year. One   focus    group   per grade   was    all female,  while  the  other  two  groups   were    mixed   sex. The    interviews
consisted of semi-structured questions (Merriam, 1998) designed to better understand students' views of Odyssey,
their beliefs  regarding   how   well   the   curriculum   was  preparing them    for a  career, their    beliefs regarding   gender
equity, their perceptions of the relevance of environmental science to their lives, and their sense of belonging to
Odyssey     High   School.   In  total we   have    interviewed  72  students   during  the   previous    two years   of  our work.
Unfortunately due to the significant transient nature of the students at Odyssey we have only been able to track forty
of the 72 students from year 1 to year 2 of our research.

Data Analysis
          Analysis of each survey item was done using chi-square tests, looking for differences among grade, gender,
and   race. Additionally,    four theoretically     constructed  scales: Science/Math       interest, Science/Math    self-efficacy,
Gender bias, and Sense of Belonging were utilized. Each scale's reliability was then assessed and items with low or
negative point biserial correlations were identified.       After removing problematic items the reliabilities of the reduced
scales were computed. Further analysis was based on the items on the reduced scales. The final reliability of the
scales were  = 0.87,  = 0.80,  = 0.81, and  = 0.87 respectively. An analysis was conducted to determine if there
were differences between the three scales on issues of grade, gender, and race. The focus groups were analyzed
using a grounded theory approach with the goal of looking for similarities and differences within and across grades,
genders,  and  racial  groups.   Lastly,   we   examined   the  data for  those  students   who  remained     enrolled   at Odyssey
throughout both years of this study.

Results and Discussion
          In general, there were significant differences between the entire student-population between the pre-post
administrations    of the    survey on   all    the scales with  the   interest  and  self-efficacy   scales  showing     significant
improvement, the gender bias scale showing a significant decrease which means meant that boys tended to perceive
girls as just as capable of doing science. However, the sense of belongingness scale showed a significant decrease
from the beginning of the year to the end of the year (see Tables 1 - 4)

          We found that students' self-efficacy, science interest and gender bias toward girls in science all showed
significant improvement during the course of year two (see Table 1). However, upon disaggregation                      the data we
found that the overall gains made by students during the course of the year was due to the girls' scores increasing
significantly  across  the   categories    of self-efficacy,   science interest, with  a non-significant     decrease    in sense of
belongingness    to  Odyssey     (see  Tables    2). Whereas,   the  boys' scores     showed   modest      increases  but   were  not
significant with the boy's significant change occurring regarding their perceptions of the girls' scientific ability (see
Table  3).  Upon     further analysis   we    found  that  the African   American    students  scores    changes   slightly  but  not
significantly except for their sense of belongingness to Odyssey which decreased significantly (see Table 4).

                                                                 259                                                        ICLS 2006
         Overall the students felt little sense of belonging to Odyssey, ownership over their learning, or reasons for
studying environmental science (see Table 1). The difference was most pronounced when comparing students who
chose to attend Odyssey versus those who did not choose attend Odyssey. For example, the students who chose to
attend Odyssey had their sense of belongingness remain steady from the start of the year to the end of the year (Mpre
= 3.52,  Mpost   =    3.51) whereas   those students  who  were   assigned to Odyssey  had  their sense of belongingness
decreased significantly (Mpre = 3.22, Mpost = 2.95, p < 0.05). We will explore this latter result in more detail in the
qualitative portion of our analysis.

         We also examined the students who remained at Odyssey from year 1 to year 2 of this study (see Table 5).
Given that Odyssey high school has a 45% transience rate it was difficult to maintain high numbers from year 1 to
year 2 but we did track 40 students across the two years. The data revealed that those students who re-enrolled at
Odyssey scores remained steady with the noticeable exception of their self-efficacy in science (Mbegining of year 1 =
3.83, Mend    of year 2 = 3.47). Given this  high  mobility rate,  we re-examined  the data without the   migrant students
(students who     either  joined  the school  late or left the school early in the year). This analysis revealed  positive
significant differences on the self-efficacy, science interest and the gender bias scale and the sense of belongingness
remained steady with no change. What was most surprisingly when removing the migrant population, however, was
that the boy's sense of belongingness increased slightly from the start of the year to the beginning of the year. When
comparisons by race were reanalyzed we found that African-American students' interest in science increased (Mpre =
2.16, Mpost = 2.23), self-efficacy increased (Mpre = 3.28, Mpost = 3.47) 2.1, p <0.05) and their sense of belongingness
decreased (Mpre = 3.34, Mpost = 3.09), though none of these findings were statistically significant.

Overview of our qualitative results
         Due to space limitations we will briefly present our qualitative findings here. Analysis of the focus group
data revealed that, in general, most students had little interest in science, generally did not feel proud of their school,
felt safe and felt that the teachers generally cared about their well being, and felt that Odyssey would be a good
school to attend if one was interested in science. The students also noted that the science classes that they took at
Odyssey was aligned to a limited degree with how they believed they learned best (hands-on and in groups) but that
they would like to see the classes shift more toward collaborative hands-on type of work.

                                                         261                                                   ICLS 2006
         A majority of the students did not know that Environmental Science was the focus of their school and
found environmental science to be irrelevant. This is particularly problematic given that the nature of the school was
to build student awareness and interest in science yet the students did not have a sense of a common purpose or
reason for attending Odyssey over any other school in the district. For example when the students were asked if they
were proud to attend Odyssey the typical response is illustrated by the following student exchange during a focus
group:

         Student 1:       I suppose.      Though it is just a high school. You know what I mean?           I didn't
                          choose to go here but I don't know what would be different if I went to another
                          school.
         Student 2:       I personally would like a bigger school.    You get to know everyone here, but there
                          is nothing to do.  You know. I like dancing and I just started up a dance club with
                          me and my friends but the school doesn't help or anything.
         Interviewer:     How about you? [asking another student in the group]
         Student 3:       Yea, I   don't  know.  The  teachers here  really care about    you.  I'm   not sure   you
                          would get that elsewhere.      Plus we do get to do a lot of stuff that other schools
                          don't get to, like go the harbor islands, make those submarine things, and take care
                          of turtles and things like that.  I think it makes a big difference if you want to do
                          science or not, if you do science then I could see this school being perfect for you,
                          but if not then it is probably just like any other school.

The focus groups also revealed that that most students viewed school science as a pragmatic study, helpful only to
someone who wants to pursue a science career, rather than seeing the skills that one develops in science can be
useful in other disciplines (which is a goal of Odyssey). While all students saw science as helpful only as a route
towards a science career, older students were more adamant toward the irrelevance of science to their futures. In
contrast, younger students (9th and 10th graders) tended to view science as part of their future careers and important
for them to understand.

Implications
         Currently  there is a significant   movement    within  the  United States  to   convert large   schools into small
learning communities. Odyssey represents the typical school-within-a-school, but as noted by the National Research
Council, "the research    supporting   the  advantages   of the  school-within-a-school      structure is not  as   strong as
comparing whole schools that vary in size" (National Research Council, 2004, p. 115). However, the research that
does exist suggests that the school-within-a-school approach can improve student attendance, student engagement,
and student satisfaction  (Eichenstein,    1994).  Our  findings presented   here   suggest  that small   theme-based   high
schools do have the potential to impact students' self-efficacy and interest in science, particularly, if the school
teachers and administrators are dedicated to creating a challenging environment for students using project-based
learning experiences (Wasly, et al., 2000). However, the findings also reveal that significant work needs to be done
in improving students' sense of belongingness. This latter point is critically important as a sense of belongingness to
a school appears   to be  critical if students are to achieve   academically  and    persist in school  (National   Research
Council, 2004). This latter point will be difficult because most students that were interviewed reported a lack of
school activities  and culture that   they  could  draw  upon  that  would   foster  a sense  of  belonging   to  the school.
Unfortunately, improving students' sense of belongingness through additional experiences will be difficult because
Odyssey had to cancel its art, music, most other club support, and a good portion of their after school program due
to budget cutbacks. Our results also suggest that school districts need to pay much more attention to students' career
wishes and  ensure   that students    are placed with  a school  that best  meets   their needs   and  interests in  terms of
potential careers.

         In closing, this work fills a gap in the research literature in that little work has been done in examining the
impact of science themed schools-within-a-school on student interest, self-efficacy, and how such schools engage
and motivate students (National Research Council, 2004). Lastly, given that the Gates foundation has award millions
of dollars to several large urban school districts to break their large schools into small learning communities the
work presented here provides some much needed base-line upon which we can evaluate the impact of the wave of
small school in regards to student interest, self-efficacy, and perception of their school.
