Until  relatively recently, institutional  education   hasbeen the main area where computers have been usedfor supporting learning while less attention has beenpaidtolearningsupportatwork.However,intheongoing discussion about the new work and workersthere is a demand to connect learning and working. AsZuboff [19, p. 395] argues, instead of being somethingseparable from work, learning is crucial to productiveactivity: "Learning is no longer a separate activity thatoccurseitherbeforeoneenterstheworkplaceorinremoteclassroomsettings.Norisitanactivitypreserved for a managerial group.
