group history tends to increase the degree of apprehension about meeting and about communications media[Chidambaram93].The Rensselaer Design Conference Room(DCR)has been created with these things in mind. The DCR isa conference-sized room accommodating 6 to 10 people.Participantsgenerally come to this room withtheir individual ideas, information, documents and visuals ready to present or otherwise inject into a teamdiscussion.The DCR has access to all network services.The physical configuration of a DCR conference issketched in Figure 1.The table has a central hexagonal portion containing "public" screens (large colormonitors)infrontofeachpairofteammembers.Three wings extend from alternate edges of the centralhexagon.Each wing houses two workstations for theuseofindividualteammembers.All screens areburied below eye level so as not to impede visibilityand dialog among team members.This table designgives each participant a private workspace as well asaccess to the DCR Collaboration Network(CN).The main CN interface is shown in Figure 2.Ituses a schematic table top to show all participants intheir posi -tions around the DCR conference table.There are three participants in this specific collaborationsession,asindi-catedbytheshadingoftheirheads.Each has an appropriately oriented copy of thistable on his/her private screen.Anne is in control ofthe public screen, and Cheryl has requested control.The person in control can drag her cursor smoothlyfrom her private screen to the public screen and backagain, shifting both mouse and keyboard control between computers.Moreover, the clipboard fol- lowssilently, carrying data between domains.To supportactive give and take, a user not in control of the publicscreen can drag her/his cursor onto the public screenwhere it turns into a personalized "ghost" cursor toserve as a pointer during discussion.The buttons in thecenter allow a user to interrupt("!") or freeze("stopsign") the control of the public screen. These mediasharing/control protocols evolve as we learn moreabout better meeting support mechanisms.
