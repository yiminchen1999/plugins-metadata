Tools  for   TeachersThe Teacher's Curriculum Assistant [25] is a designenvironment to support the curriculum developmentneeds of classroom teachers. It accesses a special TCAcurriculum repository on the Internet that points to educational resources such as RE and other learning resources available over the Internet. The design of TCAsupports fundamental collaboration activities in the following ways:and the location of the title on the Internet. Periodically, teachers using TCA update the database on theircomputers with new index records. All curriculumstructure as well as indexes for the multimedia resources are kept on the teacher's desktop computer;only the resources themselves (text, pictures, videoclips, spreadsheet templates, HyperCard stacks, software applications) need to be downloaded.TCA provides a combination of query and browsingtools for searching the indexes in its database.
