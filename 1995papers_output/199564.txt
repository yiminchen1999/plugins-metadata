electronically. Individuals who have a tendency to talk
off-the-cuff at group sessions, tend to think through
comments more thoroughly before entering them into
the system. Further, the tendency to "add noise to the
system" is discouraged by less than positive feedback
from peers who have to spend time looking at mean
ingless material.
   Some skeptics initially expressed a concern that
use of the information technology would somehow de
humanize the program.     This has not been, however,
the general perception.  Students and faculty know, see,
and still occasionally meet with their collaborators.
Further, as they become more familiar with the use of
information technology, people generally start to ex
press their own personalities and become better adept at
perceiving the personalities of others.
   Since we are very early in the implementation of
the information technology system, our conclusions
should be viewed as hypotheses rather than facts.   Our
initial experience, however, suggests that the use of in
formation technology not only enables, but substan
tially enriches our MBA program.
