    person can distinguish elements to derive his or
    her constructs within the domain. The resultant
    construct system is continuously analyzed to pro

и   Modeling tools use various forms of clustering and
    entailment derivation for the analysis and display
    of the construct systems elicited: FOCUS shows
    the system as a hierarchical structure; and Prin
    Com as a spatial map.
и   Exchange tools extend the elicitation tools to share
    elements and constructs between people and allow
    the terms in the construct system derived from one
    person to be used by another in order to determine
    whether the two construct systems are different in
    any way. It can also be used by the same person

    focus discussion among people on the differences
    which require resolution, enabling them to classify
    the disparities in terms of differing terminologies,

   This main screen is generated in sections, each of
which give the user different information relevant to
the elicitation. For example, the first suggestion is that
a new construct be added to distinguish between the el
ements, "office clerk" and "protos." If the user clicks
on "Distinguish" WebGrid will generate HTML for a
screen to enter a construct with "office clerk" at one
pole and "protos" at the other. When the construct has
been entered and the user clicks on "Done", WebGrid
will generate a screen for rating all the new elements
on the new construct similar to that of Figure 4.
   Figure 7 shows the main screen when the user has
entered 9 constructs. Now construct matches are ap
parent, and the option at the top of the screen is to enter
a new element to break the match between the con
structs "weak sequentiality-strong sequentiality" and
"non procedural-procedural."

Thus WebGrid guides the elicitation throughfeedback about relevant actions that the user may take,but the system is strongly non-modal in that no particular action is forced upon the user.FOCUS sorts the grid for proximity between similar elements and similar constructs. From Figure 9 itcan be seen that the constructs "weak sequentialitystrong sequentiality" and "non procedural-procedural" are seen as related, as are the elements "officeclerk" and "metamouse."

Figure 12. WebGrid correspondence in supervisor's con

    After having developed his own grid, the student
also used WebGrid in exchange mode to rate all the el
ements on his supervisor's constructs. Figure 13 shows
the comparison of the student's ratings of the elements
on the constructs entered by his supervisor. This analy
sis allows them to determine to what extent they agree
in the use of the same terminology in their research. It
is apparent, for example, that they do not agree on the
use of the construct "can't instruct with a program

of the instructable system "purrpuss."

    Note that the supervisor and student undertook all
these activities reciprocally, each developing their own
grids for the domain independently using their choice
of elements, and the supervisor also exchanged with
the student and rated all the student's elements on the
student's constructs. This is important, because one ob

of the power     differential between       "teacher" and
