1.  IntroductionStudent participation in collaborative, open-ended inquiry is a central goal of many current science education reform efforts. Collaborative inquiry is considereddesirable, in part, because it reflects the authentic practice of science by scientists. However most student& inhigh school science classes have little experience conducting open-ended investigations either alone or ingroups. To provide a scaffold for students as they learnto conduct collaborative inquiry, we have developed asharedmultimediadatabaseapplicationcalledtheCollaboratory Notebook.The software has been designed with the explicit goal of supporting both collaboration and scientific inquiry.It has been created bycan make an investigator's job easier by clarifying thewaythataparticularcommunitywillreceivenewwork.Thismakesgenresapotentinstrumentforinstruction, and indeed the formal features of genreslike research reports are often used for teaching. Thereis some reasonable doubt, however, as to the wisdomof"teaching"studentsgenres,atleastinthemostdidactic sense [5, 6].No doubt, the process by which students acquire awritten genre is a complex one, and this complexity isnot due just to the need for them to acquire new vocabulary and to learn to put it together.
