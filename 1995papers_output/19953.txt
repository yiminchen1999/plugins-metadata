Such environmentstake advantage of the corpus of "classroom materials"that are added to the network daily and allow studentsacrossthenationtoworktogethertoinvestigatescientific problems.Furthermore, incentives to integrate knowledge arefew.Standardized tests generally assess isolated facts,and classroom tests often mimic standardized tests.The material taught in science class is often tooabstract for students to understand.Studentsneedmodels that are appropriate for them, problems that arerelevanttotheirlives,andguidancetohelpthemdevelop an integrated understanding.Teachers often understandably rely on tried-andtrue methods, such as using lectures and textbooks,whichcanpromotebeliefsof"teacherorbookasauthority" and "science as a static field" instead of theactive, understanding-focused learning and dynamicview of science that we would like students to see asthey participate in science classes.To remedy thissituation,theKIEsoftwareandcurriculumhelpsstudents use the Net to work on large projects designed
