Six veteran social studies teachers and sixstudentteachersengagedindiscussionsofteachingstrategies and garnered mutual support for the risk-taking inherent in change. The multimedia cases provideda common context for discussion and the videoconference allowed for personalized, non-threatening contactsamong teachers at vastly different stages in their careers, but faced with similar challenges. A descriptionof the CASENET tools and resources is included.(Newman, 1994). One factor that is crucial to the effective use of technology for reform is professional developmentthatintegratestechnology(U.S.OfficeofTechnology Assessment, 1995).In specific instances it is now possible for teachersseeking professional development information tojoinon-linediscussiongroups,postquestionstobulletinboards, and obtain text files electronically.

Technology designates the Kentucky Education Technology System (KETS) as the integrated wide-areanetwork that will connect school districts, the states'colleges and universities, and its government agencies.As Kentucky schools come on-line, it will be criticalthat viable uses of the network exist to accommodatethe professional needs of teachers -- teachers who willbe expected to engage in new types of teaching (e.g.,non-graded primary instruction and portfolio assessment) and problem-solving activities vastly differentfrom those they may have learned in their previous professional preparation. The case method as we have proposed here is well established as a very effective approach to strengthening the problem-solving abilitiesof professionals (Christensen, Garvin, & Sweet, 193;Sykes & Byrd, 1993). We intend to take case teachmgwell beyond its current use through the use of CDROM technology and networking.Brown and Campione (1990) have conceptualizedthe learning community as a network of engaged participants who collaborate in reflection, critical thinki?g,and change. McLaughlin & Talbert (1993) also descrbethe critical role of professional discourse and leammgcommunities in transforming teaching practices. According to their findings, among the key factors crucialto building teachers' capacity for change is "participation in a professional community that discusses newteaching materials and strategies and that supports therisk-taking and struggle entailed in transforming practice."Due to the strategic role of technology in Kentucky's systemic reform, the stage has been set to useelectronic networks to establish collaborative on-lineprofessional communities to support teacher change.The learning community described above is beingestablished by integrating (1) electronic cases of accomplished teachers with(2) a technology system thtallows telecommunication access to other teachers mdiverse locations, and (3) focused training in the multifaceted uses of electronic cases. Using cases of successful teachers is not an new approach to professional development (Wasserman, 1993; Kagan, 1993; Kleinfeld,1989). What is novel is a recent trend to transform hardcopycasesforeducatorsintoelectronicformats(Fishman & Duffy, 1992, 1993; Desberg, Colbert&Trimble, 1995). This accomplishes two important objectives: a) the creation of much richer cases that caninclude audio and video enhancement as well as studentartifacts and b) the capability for every teacher in Kentucky to access case discussions electrnically usngCASENET. One of our primary goals m developmgCD-ROM cases is to render highly engaging narrativesof equal value to both beginning and experienced teachers.In this way, cases become the vehicle for a sharedexperienceandsubsequentconversation(BlisMazur, in press). The conceptual framework and cnteiafor the CTC cases have been described elsewhere (Bliss& Mazur, 1995a). The interface and telecommunications tools are shown in figures 1-3 below.To what extent can this integration of effectivepedagogy (case method) and advanced technology creteprofessional communities among veteran and noviceteachers who work at considerable distance from oneanother?As experienced teachers in a mral Kentuckyhigh school and student teachers at UK talked with eachother about a common thread case, we documented features of CASENET.Our goal was to identify condi
