1.  IntroductionBy their nature, case studies represent an experiencethrough which the learner can study, experiment anddiscuss a phenomenon without the liabilities of becomingengagedinaproblemwithinanactualenvironment. Case studies provide students with the opportunity to share and investigate an experience and arrive atrich,meaningfulconclusions.However,currentapproaches to the design of computer-based case studiesare frequently inadequate and inconsistent. From a traditional instructional design perspective, the process ofpreparing a case study is typically defined in terms ofspecifying objectives, collecting and editing material,and presenting it clearly and unambiguously. We andothers have criticized cases built using this approach asnot being sufficiently experiential [4, 15, 1, 12]. Casestudies created in this fashion focus on allowing thestudent to extract a message and then apply it to a newsituation; the complexity of the case is reduced in orderto achieve this goal. The student may assume that alldeal with masses of uninterpreted data can actually beconstricting; one designer was compelled to add videoessays to counteract this effect and to provide a "feel"for the location as seen by the filmmaker [13].We believe that the "richness" and "lifelikeness" ,and experiential fidelity of a case have less to do withthe amount of information provided and more to dowith an aesthetic sensibility [16]. The messiness andcomplexity of an authentic context may neither sufficiently nor efficiently be represented by great quantities of data in a variety of media, but by the way thecreators chose to arrange them. We suggest that aesthetics provides a useful, efficient approach for thinking about and creating representative scenarios withinconstructivist case studies. Our observations draw fromthe work of Eisner, Dewey, research in graphic designand architecture, our own academic training as artists,and a series of formative studies in which these ideashave been explored within actual instructional situations.
