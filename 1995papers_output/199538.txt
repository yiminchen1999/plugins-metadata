3. Conclusion
The design principles and system overview of Algo
Arena are presented in this paper. The game situation
incorporated into AlgoArena can provide students with
a social setting that they commit to problem-solving it
self at their own risk. It is comparable to the authentic
activities of programmers. In this sense, activities in
AlgoArena have high social reality. The exploratory
case study revealed that a community of practice was
able to be formed successfully and students enjoyed
the social interaction with others. Moreover, learning
performance reached the same level as that for con
ventional methods in a shorter time.
    The authors will look into more cases to examine
interaction among students and how they develop their
community of practice.
