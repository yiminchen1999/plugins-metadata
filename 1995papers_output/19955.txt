learning occurs as students use computers. On the onehand, psychological constructivists such as Kaput [5]suggest that when students are acting on dynamic symbol systems, they are able to reflect on and reify theiractions into mathematical objects. On the other hand,Pea [7] assumes a socioculturalist perspective to viewlearning as a process in which students off-load theirlower-level cognitive tasks to the surrounding environment.This off-loading frees the mind to engage inhigher-levelthinkingandplanningtasks.Fromanemergent point of view [1], a coordination of these twoconstructs suggests that there is a reflexivity betweenKaput's view that learning originates in reflection onreal-world actions and Pea's view of the computer as acognitive reorganizer of mental activities.1.1. The Candy Factory and the MacCandy FactoryTheCandyFactoryinstructionalsequencewasfirstused in a second-grade classroom in Indiana. Reflections on that project were used to inform the development of the present sequence and accompanying microworld which were used in a third-grade classroomin Tennessee. The intent of the sequence was to support students' construction of increasingly sophisticated conceptions of place value numeration and increasingly efficient algorithms for adding and subtracting three-digit numbers. The basic scenario involvedstudents imagining that they were working in a candyfactory in which candies were packed in rolls of ten,androllswerepackedinboxesoften.Duringthe
