      Abstract. In an education environment, a forum provides a valuable tool that can be used to foster
      reflection and  a   deeper analysis of   subjects  being  discussed. However,  as   an  asynchronous
      communication tool, participation can occur at any time, demanding a constant attention of the
      teacher to satisfactorily mediate the group and the discussion. In addition, a reasonable number of
      messages can be posted in a short period of time, making it hard to follow up and coordinate the
      discussion. This paper proposes an approach based on statistical and visual analysis of messages
      characteristics to alert the teacher about potential problems.

INTRODUCTION
Working in groups brings some characteristics, such as synergy, ability to consider more information, objective
evaluation, cognitive stimulation, contribution of different understanding and exposure to alternative points of
view, that can enhance learning [Benbunan-Fich & Hiltz, 1999][Hiltz, 1994]. Group members can monitor
individual thinking and group structure provides social support and encouragement for individual effort. By
formulating ideas in their words and receiving evaluation from peers, students' knowledge, thinking skills and
meanings are socially constructed [Harasim et al, 1997]. Moreover, working with peers tends to reduce anxiety
as learners share solutions to complex tasks, increasing satisfaction with the process and results.
  In asynchronous collaboration events, learners can participate at a time and a place convenient to themselves
and appropriate to the task, having more time to reflect before composing their contributions. In addition,
besides the fact that extrovert personalities continue to contribute more than quieter members do, they cannot
dominate completely as in synchronous or face-to-face situations. Quieter members still have the opportunity to
contribute [Straus, 1996]. Others learners that may feel that they do not have enough time to prepare their
thoughts in a fast-paced discussion also have in the asynchronous events a better opportunity to expose their
ideas and to contribute to the discussion in a slower-paced, less time-limited way [Funaro & Montell, 1999]. The
asynchronous format also allows students to work through difficult texts and concepts more slowly, and to help
each other to understand the contents [Bull et al, 2001].
  A forum is an asynchronous textual communication tool that can be used to create threaded discussions,
where the relations between a message and the one that it is responding to is visually characterized. As students'
responses  are posted publicly   and   become     persistent in the  environment, they  tend  to    contribute more
thoughtfully, working their arguments and backing up their ideas with evidence before turning them into essays
[LaGrandeur, 1996]. They can also share their thinking with each other, comment on each other's ideas and find
partners that share their interests in order   to get in  a  deeper discussion [Funaro  & Montel,     1999]. In this
networked learning, students should be aware that they are much more responsible for their success, looking for
their own sources of information and learning how to deal with information overload and how to convert
collaboratively information into knowledge, turning them into learners who actively generate knowledge rather
than being passive receivers [Harasim et al, 1997].
  However, in order to be successful, a forum demands a close attention of the mediator, mainly in the initial
sessions when participants are not used to the adopted dynamic yet. The mediator must mediate the forum in
order to guarantee  that  learners participate properly,  that  the discussion does not drift to    a nonproductive
direction and that the flow of information is neither too monotonous nor unmanageable [Salmon, 2000]. In
addition, by reducing the pressure to respond, it is easier for a student to drop out of the group [Graham et al,
1999]. The mediator has to demand regular contributions in an appropriate timeframe to avoid dispersion.

                                                         
  Most environments do not provide a desirable specific computational support, leaving to the mediator all the
effort to collect and analyze the information necessary to mediate group discussion. As the contributions may
occur at any time and at any rate, it gets really hard to the mediator to constantly monitor, read and follow up the
discussion in order to intervene before noise propagation.
  This paper proposes the use of a statistical and visual analysis that can be offered by the environment,
allowing the  mediator  to  timely intervene                     in the      discussion,        by saving     him   from the immediate    need   of
inspecting each message. In order to mediate the discussion, the mediator must communicate, coordinate and
cooperate [Fuks, Gerosa & Lucena, 2002]. This paper focuses on the coordination aspect of the collaboration.
Coordination is the additional effort needed to organize the group in a manner that channels communication and
cooperation  towards   the group's  objective                     [Raposo       &  Fuks,        2002].       When   coordinating a   forum   group
discussion,  the mediator  must ensure that            each          learner     participates,       that     the contributions  add value   to the
discussion and that the conversation does not drift to nonproductive direction.
  In this paper, this analysis is restricted to a set of message characteristics that can be extracted without the
need of human inspection, namely message chaining, category, size and date. Measurements such as the average
depth level of the discussion tree indicates the depth of the discussion that is taking place, and the percentage of
leafs do the same for the level of interaction. Message categorization provides a way to focus the analysis on the
specific message type in need of attention. Message size helps to identify messages that are not consistent with
others of the same type. By analyzing message timestamp, it is possible to identify the time range between
messages and their rate. Cross referencing this data also reveals other information, such as the type of message
expected per level, how fast the tree grows, which types of messages are answered more quickly etc.
  For the case study, data were extracted from a regular online course of the Computer Science Department of
the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. This course, which currently is in its 14th edition, runs in the AulaNet
learning management system. The course and the system are briefly presented in the next section.

THE COLLABORATION SCENARIO
In order to collaborate, members of a group should communicate, coordinate themselves and cooperate. While
communicating, they negotiate and make decisions. While coordinating, they deal with conflicts and organize
the group in a manner that avoids the loss of communication and cooperation efforts. While cooperating, they
work together in a shared space, seeking to complete tasks, generating and manipulating cooperation objects.
Renegotiation and decision making regarding unexpected situations turn up while cooperating, thus, demanding
new rounds of communication, which on its turn, will require more coordination to reorganize the tasks to be
further executed during the next round of cooperation. This cycle shows the iterative nature of collaboration.
Participants interact, obtaining   feedback            from           their     actions         and feedthrough       from the   actions  of their
companions by means of awareness elements. The diagram shown in Figure 1 summarizes this cycle. It is based
on models found in the literature, such as the 3C model proposed by Ellis et al. [1991] and the Clover design
model [Laurillau & Nigay, 2002]. This paper focus is on the coordination aspect of collaboration.

  The AulaNet learning management system provides an environment for teaching and learning via Web and
was developed based on the 3C collaboration model. It has been under development since June 1997 by the
Software Engineering Lab of the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). The AulaNet is a freeware
and it is available in Portuguese, English and Spanish versions1. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, more than 6000
university students and 20000 workers in their companies have been using AulaNet.
  The Information Technology Applied to Education (ITAE) course has been taught entirely at a distance
using the AulaNet environment since 1998. Its objective is to get learners to collaborate using information
technology,  becoming   Web-based   educators                     [Fuks,      Gerosa &          Lucena,      2002]. The  course  seeks to build  a

learning network where the group learns, mainly, through the interaction of its participants in collaborative
learning activities.
    Some points of the course's dynamics need to be characterized for the sake of the case study. The course is
organized by topics, with one topic being discussed per week. Learners read selected content regarding the
weekly topic, conduct research to enhance their understanding about it and, then, take part in an asynchronous
discussion about three specific questions regarding that topic. This discussion is carried out over 50 hours using
the AulaNet Conferences service, which implements a forum. To close the weekly discussion, learners revisit
the same questions using a chat tool during one hour.
    In the ITAE course, the role of transmitting information and leading the discussion, which generally is an
attribute of course mediators, is shared with learners. A learner is selected in each conference to play the role of
the seminar  leader,   being responsible          for preparing         an initial message  followed       by  three aforementioned
questions, referred by group members to develop their argumentation. During this phase, the seminar leader is
also responsible for keeping the discussion going on and maintaining the conference's dynamics.
    In AulaNet, the learner can select a category for the message from a set that have been previously defined by
the course teacher [Gerosa, Fuks & Lucena, 2001]. The available categories in the ITAE course, used to identify
the message  type,   are Seminar, Question,           Argumentation,        Counter-Argumentation          and  Clarification. In the
ITAE  course,  the   seminar leader posts          a  message from         the Seminar   category       to serve as  the root  of the
discussion, as well as three messages from the Question category. During the following 50 hours, all learners
engage in the discussion.
    Each Conference message is graded and commented upon individually by the mediators in order to provide
guidance to learners on how to prepare their texts, avoiding the sending in of contributions that do not add value
to the group. Contributions are commented upon in the message itself, generally in a form that is visible to all
participants, so that the learners better understand where they can improve and what they have gotten right.

ANALYSIS OF MESSAGE CHARACTERISTICS
Analyses about message chaining, categorization, size and date are presented in this section, illustrating how
these characteristics can help in the coordination of educational forums. The data and examples were collected
from seven editions of the ITAE course (from the second semester of 2001 to the second semester of 2004).

Message Chaining
Communication tools have different ways of structuring messages: linear (list), hierarchical (tree) or network
(graph), as can be seen in Figure 2. Despite the fact that a list is a specific case of a tree, and this is a particular
type of graph, no one structure is better than another. Linear structuring is appropriate for communication in
which the chronological order of the messages, such as the sending of notices, reports and news, is important.
Hierarchical structuring on a forum, on the other hand, is appropriate when the relationships between messages,
such as questions and answers, need to be quickly identified. However, it is relevant to point out that, since there
is no way to link messages from two different branches, the tree can only grow wide and, thus, the discussion
takes place in diverging   lines [Stahl,          2001]. Network         structuring can   be      used to seek  convergence   of the
discussion.

                                                                                           Network

                                                Figure 2. Examples of discussion structure
    In the ITAE course, the forum, based on the AulaNet Conferences service, is used for the in-depth discussion
of the course's subject matter. The format of the resulting tree indicates the depth of the discussion and the level
of interaction [Pimentel, Fuks & Lucena, 2003]. For example, a tree like the one exemplified in Figure 3 has
only three levels, which indicates that there was almost no interaction, given that level zero is the seminar
message, level one comprises the three questions and level two comprises the answers to the questions. This
means that learners only answered the initial questions.

                                                                 
                                       Figure 3. Example of a corresponding tree
    The trees extracted from the conferences of the five editions of the ITAE course are shown in Figure 4. It
can be also noted that in some editions the depth of the tree become shallower over the semester while in others
it becomes deeper. It can be seen that in 2003.1 and 2003.2 the trees gets deeper, indicating that learners
improved their argumentation skills during those semesters. On the other hand, in 2002.1 the trees got shallower
over the semester, most probably due to lack of coordination. It is also possible to observe that normally the first
conference corresponding tree is the shallowest one. It is possible for example to visually compare the depth of
the conferences of a given edition with those of other editions. However, in order to conduct a more precise
analysis, it is also necessary to have statistical information about these trees, as presented in Figure 5.
    The trees shown in Figure 4 and the charts in Figure 5 indicate that the interaction on the 2002.1 edition
declined over the course of the conferences, while the interaction on ITAE 2003.1 edition increased. It can be
seen in Figure 5 that the average depth of the trees in the 2002.1 edition declined while the percentage of
messages without answers (leafs) increased, which indicates that learners were interacting less as the course
progressed. In the first four conferences of this edition, the average level of the tree was 3.0 and the percentage
of messages without answers was 51%; in the last four conferences, the average tree level was 2.8 and the leafs
were 61%. On the other hand, in the 2003.1 edition, learners' interaction increased over the course: the trees
were  getting deeper while   the leafs were  decreasing. The  average   depth       level was   2.2 in  the  first four
conferences, increasing to 3.0 in the last four, while the percentage of leafs went from 69% in the first four
conferences to 53% in the last four. While the 2002.1 edition learners slowly decreased their interaction level,
the 2003.1 edition  learners quickly   increased their interaction level.        Another indication of  the  declining
interaction level of the former is the continuous decline in the number of messages.
    All this information was obtained without having to read messages. Comparing the discussion trees during
the progress of the course should be enough to let mediators intervene in order to guarantee a maximum depth
level, a minimum number of leafs and a desirable amount of messages. Mediators may also intervene when a
given conference is not following an expected quantity of messages per level. This pattern is shown in Figure 6.
    In level 0, where just a seminar message is expected, there is an average of one message in each tree of the
course editions. In level 1, there is an average of 3 messages, which are the three questions proposed by the
seminar leader. Level 2 contains the arguments responding direct to a question, forming a peak in the quantity of
messages. In level 3 and thereafter the number of message decreases. If the quantity of messages in a given level
of a tree in a given conference departs significantly from this pattern, mediators should intervene.

Message Categorization
Upon  preparing  a message,  the  author chooses  the  category that is most        appropriate to  the content being
developed, providing a semantic aspect to the relationship between messages. Looking at the categories, learners
and mediators  estimate how   the discussion is  progressing and   the probable       content of   the  messages.  The
AulaNet does not force the adoption of a fixed set of categories. The teacher who plans the course can change
the category set to the objectives and characteristics of the group and their tasks.

                       The categories adopted in the ITAE conferences were originally based on the IBIS' node types [Conklin,
 1988]. The categories adaptation was made based on the information provided by follow-up reports furnished by
 AulaNet, like category usage per participant [Fuks, Gerosa & Lucena, 2002]. Currently, the categories defined
 in the course are: Seminar, for the root message of the discussion, posted by the seminar leader at the beginning
 of                   the                  week;     Question,            to   propose     discussion                       topics,        also   posted      by       the seminar                        leader;     Argumentation,              to
 answer the questions, posing the author's point of view in the message subject line and the arguments for it in
 the body of the message; Counter-Argumentation, to be used when the author states a position that is contrary to
 an argument; and finally, Clarification, to request or clarify doubts about a specific message.

                                           Figure 6. Average quantity of messages per tree level corresponding to the conferences
       Figure 7 presents the percentage of messages of each category on the different tree levels of the course. As
expected, one can observe that on level 0 (the tree root), the predominant category is Seminar, on level 1 it is
Question, and on level 2 it is Argumentation. The Counter-Argumentation category begins to appear on level 3
and its relative usage increases; the use of the Clarification category begins to appear as of level 1 (it is possible
to clarify a seminar or a question). Those messages whose relationship between the category and the level differ
from what has been described, normally, derive from choosing a wrong category.

       The category also helps to identify the direction that the discussion is taking. For example, in a tree or a
branch that only contains argumentation messages, there is no idea confrontation taking place, which is bad for
the argumentation practice. Similarly, excessive counter-argumentation should attract mediators' attention. The
group might have got into a deadlock or, even worst, there may be interpersonal conflicts taking place.

Message Size
       As each category has a different semantics and influences the way that messages are composed, message size
analysis was made for each category. Figure 8 presents the average values of characters for each category and
average deviations. In this figure, one can see that the Seminar category is the one having the largest messages,
followed               by     Argumentation               and                 Counter-Argumentation.                            The                    shortest          messages              are those                    belonging              to       the
Question and Clarification categories.

       During an edition of the course, one of the learners said: "When we counter-argue we can be more succinct,
since the subject matter is already known to all." If the subject is known to all (because it was presented during
the previous messages) the author can go directly to the point that interests him or her. This can be noted in the
chart in Figure 9, which shows a decline in the average quantity of characters per level in the Argumentation
(correlation coefficient = -86%) and the Counter-Argumentation (correlation coefficient = -92%) categories. The
analysis was restricted to these two categories because Seminar and Question do not show in higher levels and
Clarification seems to be level independent regarding size (correlation coefficient = 48%).

Message Date
On the ITAE course, the conference goes for 50 hours: from 12 noon Monday to 2 pm Wednesday. Figure 11
presents the hourly rate of messages sent during conferences. Until the 2003.2 edition, it can be seen that there is
a burst during the last five hours of the conference. In some cases, more than 50% of the messages are sent
during this period of time. This phenomenon of students waiting until the last possible moment to carry out their
tasks                 is   well       known           and          has   been        dubbed                 "Student        Syndrome"                              [Goldratt,                1997].         The        act     of     sending
contributions near to the deadline disturbs an in-depth discussion, given that last-minute messages will neither
be graded nor be answered during the discussion. This might be the reason for an excessive amount of leafs on
the trees in some conferences, hence, less interaction.

   In    order       to avoid     this   unwelcome              behavior      mediators           have   to     encourage       the   earlier      sending      in   of
contributions. Unfortunately, our experience with this course has shown that this encouragement does not work.
In the   2004.1         edition,    the  following         experiment         was    conducted.          The       last    4   conferences        had    a    different
assessment rule than the first 4 conferences: if until the 25th hour the learner had not sent half of the expected
amount of messages, the grade of all the messages sent during the following 25 hours would be divided by 2.
The new rule seemed to work.

   In   Figure       12,   the   second      chart     does      not    show   message          burst   indicating         that the   rule    has       worked.     The
percentage of messages sent during the last 5 hours of conference felt from 33% in the first half of the course to
13% in the second half. Nevertheless, there are lower 25th and 50th peaks. However, now mediators and learners
have room to access and answer the first batch of messages. The same thing can be seen in Figure 13, where all
8 conferences of the 2004.2 edition were assessed based on the aforementioned rule. In this conference, an
average of 18% of messages was sent during the last 5 hours.

   For    the     moment,        the   no-need-to-read-messages-right-now                         measurements           stop   there.      From   this    point     on,
mediators have a clear picture of what is going on in the conferences, but there is no way of avoiding the
reading of messages. Anyhow, the conferences seem to be more balanced as an effect of the steering done by the
mediators based on the use of statistical and visual information.

CONCLUSION
   Communication among learners takes a fundamental role in the learning process through the exchange of
information and points of view and interconnecting the group. Groupware technology supports collaborative
learning activities, providing an environment where group interaction takes place. A forum provides a valuable
tool that can be used to foster reflection in a paced learning. However, educational environments still do not
offer computational aids that are appropriate for coordinating forums.
   Message           chaining,      categorization,          size     and     message         timestamp         are   characteristics         that      help   in    the
coordination of educational forums within ITAE. Based upon the form established by message chaining, it is
possible to infer the level of interaction among course participants. Message categorization provides semantics
to the way messages are interconnected, helping to identify the accomplishment of tasks, incorrect message
nesting and the direction that the discussion is taking. The analysis of message timestamp makes it possible to
identify      the    Student     Syndrome          phenomenon,           which      gets      in  the   way        of the    development          of    an    in-depth
discussion.
   By    analyzing         the   characteristics          of    messages,      mediators          are   able    to    better   coordinate         learners,    having
indication     of    when    to   intervene         in    order   to    keep   the    discussion         from        moving     in   an     unwanted       direction.
Furthermore, these analyses could be used to develop filter for intelligent coordination and mechanisms for error
reduction.     It    should      be    emphasized         that   these      quantitative          analyses      provide      indications      and       alerts  about
problematic situations, but also show whether the discussion is going well.
   A well coordinated forum does not necessarily imply in learning taking place, it is still up to the teacher to
insert  forum-based          relevant        activities    in    the    course      dynamics       and       to motivate       learners      to   ensure      learning
outcomes. The statistics and analysis presented in this paper help to better mediate the discussion process and to

                                                                                 
identify uncommon situations, which does not necessarily means problems; it requires the teacher to check them
out,  inspecting  the  content of   the discussion.  In addition, although   this paper   is focused on   the teacher
mediation, the information presented may also be used by learners to better coordination themselves.
  There is no ideal visual and statistical outcome that educators should steer their course towards. The teacher
should interpret the statistical and visual information taking into consideration the course's and participants'
characteristics. Final  decision   and  judgment    are still up  to mediators.   Discourse   structure and   message
categorization also help to organize the recording of the dialogue, facilitating its subsequent recovery. Based
upon the tree form, with the help of the categories, it is possible to obtain visual information about the structure
of the discussion [Kirschner et al, 2003]. Mediators using collaborative learning environments to carry out their
activities should take these characteristics into account for the better coordination of educational forums.
