       Abstract. Although constructivism has been prevailed across schools in Japan, what they call
       constructivism is a "shallow" one (Scardamalia, & Bereiter, 2002).      In collaboration with teachers
       at a laboratory school, we have been conducting design studies on a lesson for knowledge building
       from  the perspective of  "deep"   constructivism.    For  embodying    such a   new  lesson, a CSCL
       technology called Knowledge Forum® has been introduced.          Through the progressive refinement
       of lesson plans, we have been involved in creating pedagogical design principles (Linn, Davis, &
       Bell (Eds.), 2004) by referring to the metaprinciples on knowledge building (Scardamalia, 2002).
       In this report, we describe our refinement process of a fifth-grade lesson on genetically modified
       foods through two years, and discuss how the pedagogical design principles can be transformed
       into design elements.

LEARNING AS KNOWLEDGE BUILDING
In the educational reform debate in Japan, people are still in puzzlement with regard to the unsolved dichotomy
in decision making: intellectual curiosity vs. basic skill training.  In 2003, the Ministry of Education, Science,
Sports, and Culture reformed their national guideline by introducing a totally new course called "the period for
the integrated study." For deploying such a new part in the existing curriculum, the ministry reduced the time
for other subjects by 30 % then cordoned more than 100 class hours a year from the third grade through the ninth
grade (i.e., elementary and junior high schools).  They are planning to gradually extend this curriculum to the
tenth through twelfth grade (i.e., senior high schools).
  What is currently happening, on the contrary, is that some schools just go back to the basics by using the
period to make students engage in skill acquisition. The schools claim that they need to educate students basic
skills rather than having students think of what to learn by themselves.  The phenomenon like this manifests that
many schools cannot have their visions on the period for the integrated study as time for students to engage in
meaningful learning.   A reason behind the situation is that schools do not have sufficient resources to establish
their own  curriculum  based  on  a new   epistemological    idea on  students as  life-long learners  or knowledge
builders.
  The goal of our research project funded by the ministry of education, science, sports, and culture in Japan is
to establish a curriculum in the period for the integrated study by designing and progressively refining lessons
based  on  knowledge    resources by  practitioners  and     learning scientists (e.g., Oshima,   Oshima,   Inagaki,
Nakayama,    Yamaguchi,   Takenaka,  &    Murayama,      2003; Oshima,    Oshima,  Murayama,     Inagaki, Takenaka,
Nakayama,   &  Yamaguchi,    2004).  The epistemology of learning we have adopted to our design studies is
"learning as knowledge   building   (Scardamalia, &  Bereiter,    2002)."  In  the view  of  learning  as knowledge
building, we see students work at the frontier of their shared understanding and collaboratively build their
knowledge   on the top  of their  current understanding.     Scardamalia  (2002)   describes twelve   metaprinciples
("determinants" in her original word) for making the classroom a knowledge building community.             A central
notion of the metaprinciples is "collective cognitive responsibility."    People who are identified to engage in
knowledge   building should  be  building  knowledge     for the  purpose of   contributing  to the  advancement of
collective understanding in their community.  The notion is decomposed into twelve principles as follows:
  1. Real ideas, and authentic problems.    In the classroom as a knowledge building community, learners are
concerned with understanding based on their real inquiries.    Problems usually used in the classroom are far from
students' real concerns with the world they live in.     On the other hand, if students are allowed to pursue any

                                                         
topic with no tools for their learning, the activities do not support learning or knowledge building.         Thus, we
need to scaffold students to be keen on their inquiries and articulate their inquiries as pursuable problems.
   2. Improvable ideas.      Students' ideas on their learning materials and problems are regarded as improvable
objects. Ideas are objectified and shared in some ways as conceptual artifacts (Bereiter, 2002) so that students
can engage in discourse around them.
   3. Idea diversity.  The diversity of ideas raised by students is a natural and necessary context of knowledge
building in the classroom.    In didactic instruction, teachers take cognitive responsibility to manage the diversity,
often  ignoring it  or subordinating  it   to their predetermined   agenda.   In the knowledge building classroom,
students themselves take on the responsibility for managing their ideas to improve collective understanding.
   4. Rise above.   Through the improvement of ideas or understanding, students create more inclusive syntheses
or super-ordinate concepts by summarizing previous ideas.
   5.  Epistemic   agency.       Students  themselves  manage     how  their  knowledge  could   be advanced.    They
coordinate their personal ideas with others, and also monitor how their collaborative efforts proceed.          These
tasks require them to exert cognitive strategies for collaborative problem solving.
   6.  Community    knowledge,    collective  responsibility.   Students' contribution  to  improving  their  collective
knowledge in the classroom is the primary purpose of the knowledge building classroom.              The shift in their
recognition from "learning as the improvement of individual knowledge" to "learning as individual contributions
to the collective understanding" is crucial.
   7. Democratizing knowledge.      All individuals contribute to the knowledge advancement in the classroom in
various ways.   As designers of knowledge building environments, we must be carefully concerned with how
students' group works can contribute to their collective knowledge advancement.
   8. Symmetric knowledge advancement.          A goal for knowledge building communities is to have individuals
and organizations actively working to advance their knowledge, and have their advances at the same time serve
to advance the knowledge of others.    Thus there is reciprocity in knowledge work, with the outputs of one group
helping another group, and creating a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts.
   9.  Pervasive   knowledge     building. Students   acquire   a disposition to contribute  to  collective  knowledge
building. It is not something they do at special moments, or in special classes, or during particular curriculum
activities. Rather it is integral to how they approach all knowledge problems and it is extensible across contexts,
grades and working contexts.
   10.  Constructive   uses   of authoritative  sources.   Problems   of  passive   reading and  inert knowledge      are
frequently   reported  in the literature.   Another   form of   passivity comes   from  treating text  as the ultimate,
authoritative  source.    In the  knowledge    building  classroom,   students  are encouraged   to   use resources   as
conceptual artifacts that are treated as objects of inquiry, and juxtaposed against their personally constructed
artifacts.  In terms of the van Dijk and Kintsch (1983) model of reading comprehension, knowledge builders
actively create both a situation and text model, working actively with both models in ways that lead to more
effective learning.   Visiting experts in the classroom are not teachers who know everything, but co-researchers.
All members, including the teacher, sustain inquiry at the cutting edge of their understanding.
   11. Knowledge building discourse.       Students are engaged in discourse to objectify their ideas, to share with
each other, and to improve the knowledge advancement in the classroom.           Scientific discourse is a typical form
of knowledge    building   discourse.  Conceptual     artifacts in scientific discourse are  frequently   objectified as
propositional knowledge.     There are strategic discourse patterns for improving the conceptual artifacts (Bereiter,
1994, 2002). Appropriate scaffold supports encourage students to engage in such progressive discourse on their
ideas.
   12. Concurrent, embedded and transformative assessment.            For the knowledge advancement, appropriate
monitoring is crucial.  Students need to look at a total view of their understanding then decide how to proceed in
their knowledge building. They create portfolios, comment on each other's work, and engage in a variety of self-
monitoring activities.    They do not wait for outside experts to evaluate them, but rather evaluate their own
progress on an ongoing basis.      Accordingly, they are often able to exceed the expectations that others set for
them. This collective effort by students to reflect on their collective knowledge is facilitated by the engagement
of the teacher as a member of the knowledge building community, not the sole community member responsible
for evaluating progress.
   In this study, we transformed the twelve metaprinciples into several pedagogical and pragmatic principles
(Linn, Davis, & Bell (Eds.), 2004) so that we can concretely design lessons in the classroom.         Furthermore, for
supporting our lesson plans for knowledge building, a CSCL technology, Knowledge Forum® was implemented
in the classroom.   In the next section, we describe what pedagogical and pragmatic principles we adopted to our
lessons and how we used the CSCL technology to empower student learning as knowledge building.

                                                           
PEDAGOGICAL               DESIGN       PRINCIPLES,           AND        KNOWLEDGE             FORUM®          AS     A
TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT STUDENTS ENGAGE IN KNOWLEDGE BUILDING
Twelve   determinants   (Scardamalia,  2002)   are general   principles  across a  variety of contexts   of  knowledge
building.  Whereas they are useful to identify how much closer our communities are to the knowledge building
community, they are somewhat too general to design actual lessons or classrooms at schools.         What we had to do
at  the first step to  adopt the knowledge     building determinants    to our  design  studies was   to transform   the
determinants into pedagogical or pragmatic principles (Linn et al., 2004).         The pedagogical design principles
should be descriptions on how and what we need to prepare for supporting student learning as knowledge
building.  They should be articulate enough and easier to understand for teachers or supporters to take their
instructional actions.  In our studies on the period for the integrated study, we transformed the determinants into
the following four pedagogical design principles.
    Student ideas should always be at the center of their practice.     Knowledge building is a type of practice in
which learners engage in knowledge advancement based on their ideas.            In Japanese classrooms, student ideas
are sometimes treated as important resources, but cannot exist in the center of their practice all the time.      Their
ideas are used by teachers to introduce predetermined learning goals, but rarely revisited by students.       The idea-
centered classroom is, therefore, not familiar to students as well as teachers.       For getting student ideas easily
elicited and   existed at anytime  students liked  to  work  on   them,  we  implemented   Knowledge     Forum®      as a
medium for students to externalize their ideas in a communal database where they could revisit their previous
ideas to collaboratively revise or organize the ideas for their further knowledge advancement.           In Knowledge
Forum®, students could report their ideas in the form of multimedia notes with scaffolds for their constructive
discourse on their own ideas, and revisit their own and others' notes to organize ideas by themselves and their
colleagues and build new ideas on their previous ones.         Their discourse and manipulation in organizing and
building on their ideas are represented as different types of notes in the database and configuration of notes in a
hierarchical structure of discussion spaces (called "views").
    Student   learning should  be  structured  in  such a   way   that every student   should   have  her/his cognitive
responsibility.    In the knowledge building community or team, every participant should contribute to their
collective    knowledge   advancement.      In other    words,  every   participant   should  have   her/his  cognitive
responsibility.    In professional organizations,  people    with different  types  of expertise  are  involved   in the
collective problem solving in this way.      In classrooms, however, students are not experts, and do not have
recognition on how their own learning is related to others'.    For making every student develop their expertise or
ideas to contribute to their classroom knowledge, the task structure in which students work on their own ideas
and the activity structure by which they collaboratively work on their ideas were designed as follows.            Tasks
students challenge in the classroom should be authentic and real problems elicited from their ideas related to
their study topic.  Furthermore, the problems should be shared by students to use their expertise to contribute to
the advancement of their collective understanding.      We, therefore, asked students to generate their knowledge-
based   questions  rather than   text-based questions   (Scardamalia,   &   Bereiter,  1992).   In  addition, we   used
collaborative learning by small groups (three or four students per group) as a minimum learning unit in which
students with different ideas reciprocally helped one another to solve their challenging problems.
    Communication at different group sizes should be encouraged and supported with different media.                  The
classroom knowledge is advanced through student collaboration with different types of discourses happening in
the classroom.   In Japanese classrooms, student discourse activities are mainly happening at small group or in
the classroom as a whole.    In our design studies, several cognitive tools such as worksheets for groupwork and
Knowledge      Forum®     were implemented     in  lesson  plans.   The    implementation    of  Knowledge     Forum®
particularly made it possible for students to engage in inter-group discourse during their groupwork.             Three
different layers of communication, i.e., intragroup, intergroup, and the classroom discourse, were structured for
students to gradually transform their individual ideas into more collective ideas.
    Students have opportunities to think of their problems, organize ideas, and reflect on their progress toward
what they want to understand.      Working on ideas is a really metacognitive aspect of learning.         Teachers are
usually taking the metacognitive role of student learning.     Students are not asked "how would you like to learn
on this issue?" or "what do you think we should do for understanding this issue further?"          Teachers think that
answers to these questions should be included in their material studies and designed as part of their instructions.
Teachers know that students bring a variety of ideas related to the study topic, but that it is not possible to expect
all beforehand.     High   quality of teachers    redirect a variety   of  student ideas   toward  the   learning goals
predetermined in lesson plans, but rarely take this role over to students themselves.      In this study, we designed
lesson plans so that students regularly take the metacognitive role of their own learning and a teacher would play
another   role  of  supervising  students'  activities  of   eliciting problems    to  be  pursued,  organizing   ideas
collaboratively, and reflecting on progress in their learning.

                                                           
DESIGN          STUDIES           IN  THE       PERIOD          FOR       THE      INTEGRATED              STUDY:
PROGRESSIVE              REFINEMENT               OF      A    LESSON        PLAN      ON        GENETICALLY
MODIFIED FOODS
A topic we chose for our design studies was "genetically modified foods (GM foods)."             GM foods is one of
global and authentic issues in our life, and has been scientifically discussed on its advantage and disadvantage
(Bell, 2004).   In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare established their criteria to test GM food
safety. Some GM crops have been confirmed their safety and allowed to be put on the market.            The reality is,
however, that many food product companies do not like to use GM crops as ingredients of their products because
their customers    are still very anxious   about  the safety.  In our designed  lessons,  fifth grade  students in a
classroom at a laboratory school challenged this issue by identifying problems around the issue, conducting
research on the problems, and utilizing their knowledge to generate their own solutions to the problems.         In the
first year, based on the preceding research and practices (e.g., GM foods lessons in WISE project), we designed
a lesson plan by implementing design elements (Collins, Joseph, & Bielaczyc, 2004) with the four pedagogical
design principles described above.      During the practice of lessons, we videotaped how students engaged in
learning in the classroom, and how a teacher supported their learning.       Analyses on the video records and notes
reported on Knowledge Forum® helped us to diagnose our lesson plan and interventions we did during the
practice.  In the second year, we revised our lesson plan based on our diagnosis of the first year's plan, and
conducted again the practice in another fifth grade classroom with the same teacher.            Data collected in  the
second year were compared with those in the first year for evaluating the revision of the lesson plan.

The First Year's Design Study

The Classroom Description
Forty-one fifth grade students (21 females, and 20 males) were engaged in their learning on GM foods in the
period for the integrated study.   The lesson started  in May and continued through July for 23 class hours (A class
hour was 45 minutes long.).     Students were expected to know about the word but not any scientific mechanism
or why they have been being developed.         In glossary stores, labels of products usually described that products
did not include any GM crops.        So, it was difficult for students to actually see food products including GM
crops.  Parents    were concerned    with the  products   with GM   crops as  ingredients, and   might think  that the
products were not safe enough and caused some allergies to people who were vulnerable to GM crops.
Designing a Lesson on GM Foods
We developed design elements based on the pedagogical principles we adopted, and designed a lesson in the first
year as follows.
  Student ideas should always be at the center of their practice.     The lesson started by asking students of what
they thought on GM foods.      The teacher created a concept map (on the blackboard) based on students' ideas for
representing what they knew, and having them share their ideas with each other.        Their classroom concept map
was used further to elicit issues they had to pursue for further learning by themselves.    The teacher coordinated
their discussion on what issues to be further studied.      Students found three issues to be valuable for them to
further study: (1) scientific understanding on GM foods, (2) advantages and disadvantages on GM foods, and (3)
current situation of GM foods in their real life.  Each student chose one of the issues as her/his own theme to be
pursued   in small  groups   (The  activity structure  of small groups   are described later.), and  their ideas were
regularly reported on Knowledge Forum® so that they reflected on their progress and others' at anytime they
wanted to do so.    The teacher and supporters also created a view on classroom activity reports for students.
Pictures on the blackboard and how students were engaged in their learning in each class were reported on the
view.
  Student    learning   should  be structured   in such   a way  that every  student should  have   her/his  cognitive
responsibility.  Students were not asked to do tasks given by the teacher, but to generate issues for their own
study   by themselves   and   take a part   of the classroom   research.  Because  they    chose their own   issue by
themselves, motivation to their study was high.     In addition, we designed the basic unit of their learning in small
groups.    A group was composed of three or four students who chose the same issue to study.           Students were
encouraged to work collaboratively and to report their ideas on Knowledge Forum® as group notes.           The teacher
supported students to report their collaborative ideas by giving them worksheets where they could write their
individual   ideas to  share  them with other   group  members   before  reporting on  Knowledge     Forum®.     Ideas
reported by groups within/between issues were discussed at different sizes of their classroom community (see
details in the next section).   In the final stage of their learning, based on their studies on GM foods, students
were encouraged to discuss how they should live with this new technology as consumers of food products.            In a
view called "GM food conference," students expressed their opinions and their reasons or information resources
by citing notes on Knowledge Forum® and references at the school library.

                                                           
   Communication at different group sizes should be encouraged and supported with different media.              We
designed three different layers of communication: intragroup, intergroup, and the classroom discourse.          The
intragroup communication was mainly based on oral discourse in face-to-face.     We implemented worksheets for
individual group members to express their ideas before talking to one another within groups.             The  written
discourse by individual group members were used as objects to share and have discourse on for constructing
their collaborative ideas.
   The collaborative ideas by different groups were further shared to organize as more collective ideas among
different groups within the same issues or between different issues.    Several scaffolds (a function prepared in
Knowledge Forum®) were used for helping students report their ideas as structured arguments.         Before starting
their groupwork, students discussed how to report their group ideas so that they could share them with one
another in a meaningful way.       Different structures of arguments were found to be needed in different issues
because they applied  different types of research methodologies to the three issues. Based on their discussion,    the
teacher and supporters created   different types of scaffolds (a type of tags by which students wrote their ideas in
subsection of a note), and students used the scaffolds in writing their arguments in notes.   In organizing notes by
different groups  within   the same  issues, another function  in   Knowledge   Forum®,   "rise above,"   was  used.
Students could collect similar ideas to drag multiple notes in a "rise above box" and report a summary on their
ideas in a superordinate note.  The activity of manipulating notes by different groups within the same issue was
conducted through the supervision by the teacher.      The teacher projected a target view on a screen in front of
students  working  on the   issue, and asked   students to  discuss how to  organize  their   ideas in notes.  After
organizing their ideas in their target views, students further discussed with students working with different issues
on what they found and how their findings were related to one another in the classroom as a whole.
   Students have opportunities to think of their problems, organize ideas, and reflect on their progress toward
what they want to understand.      During their groupwrok, students were encouraged by the teacher to regularly
reflect on their progress by reading, revising, and building on notes by themselves and other groups.          Some
benchmark lessons (Brown, 1989) were designed in our lesson plan.           Because the classroom activities were
dynamic, we changed our lesson plan by implementing more benchmark lessons at anytime we thought that we
needed to do so for students to share important resources or ideas with others.
Evaluation of Student Learning as Knowledge Building
We evaluated our lesson by two different types of analyses on student activities in the classroom.          The first
analysis was conducted on the quality of problems students had in their learning.        Based on their discourse in
notes on Knowledge Forum®, we identified four different levels of questions by referring to the categorization
by Chan, Lee, & vanAalst (2001).     Qualities of students' questions they pursued were compared across different
views (or stages of learning).  The second analysis was conducted based on our observation of the classroom and
the discourse on Knowledge Forum® to figure out what events did happen in relation to the knowledge building
determinants (Scardamalia, 2002).
   Qualities of Students' Questions Identified in Their Discourse on Knowledge Forum®.         Knowledge building
is a unique type of cognitive activity, and can be evaluated only by analyzing a process by which learners
manipulate  their  knowledge    (Bereiter, &   Scardamalia,  1993).  One  strategy   for evaluating  the process   of
knowledge building is to analyze what types of questions learners are engaged in (e.g., Oshima, Scradamalia, &
Bereiter, 1996).  Chan et al. (2001) analyzed questions that high school students had in their learning on the plate
tectonics theory.  They found that the high school students came to deal with higher qualities of questions as
they proceeded their learning, and that the quality of their questions were positively correlated to the level of
their final conceptual understanding.      The four levels of questions identified by Chan et al. (2001) were as
follows:
·   Level 1: Definition questions.   Students just ask the definition of the term or concept. The most typical and
    initial question in our lesson was "What is a genetically modified food?"
·   Level 2: Factual, topical, and general questions.   The second level is a type of question that reflects facts or
    general statements.    In most cases, when students ask this type of questions, their idea is around some facts
    or  topics. One example in our lesson was "What crops are genetically    modified?"
·   Level 3: Puzzlement questions.     When students showed their puzzlement by collecting ideas by different
    members and recognizing some gaps among the ideas, their puzzlement was identified as level 3.            In our
    lesson, after learning advantages and disadvantages on GM foods, they recognized some gaps between pros
    and cons.    They could not figure out what further questions they should pursue for filling the gaps, but
    thought that the filling the gaps was important to them.
·   Level 4: Explanation-based questions.      When students identified inconsistencies or gaps between their ideas
    then  proposed  articulate  questions  for solving  the problems, their questions    were identified as  level 4.
    Students could recognize the problem they had, and decompose the problem into tasks or questions that they
    should work on in the next step.

higher  levels      as they  proceeded              their learning.    In a  few  notes, students    were   engaged  in  high    quality  of
knowledge building activity through their explanations on what they had learned.                            In many notes, on the other
hand, students were still concerned with factual or topical questions.
   Students' Activities Related to Knowledge Building Determinants.                       During their discourse on the ideas on and
off Knowledge Forum®, students were encouraged to consider relations among ideas and to propose new ideas
from superordinate perspectives.                    Based on their own concept map, students elicited three issues they had to
pursue: (1) "What are GM foods?" (2) "Why are they being developed?" and (3) "Do we have them in Japan?"
The three issues were pursued by several small groups in different views.                       After their studies on the three issues,
they shared their ideas and new understanding between groups in different views and gave comments on each
                                                                                                        other's notes.  Their comments

epistemic agency for knowledge building by effectively using functions prepared in Knowledge Forum®.                                     An
example of discourse by Group 14 is seen in Figure 2.                       The group expressed their negative position toward GM
foods in the "GM foods conference" view.                      Their reasoning to make their decision was constructive rather than
providing evidences that GM foods are not safe.                         In their discourse, they used three different idea resources.
First, they used their own idea for their reasoning.                    Before expressing their ideas on GM foods in the conference
view,   they had       studied     how    ordinary        customers     thought about  GM   foods    by their  interview   research    at a
supermarket.        Their conclusion was that Japanese customers could choose GM foods or organic ones with their
preference in our current situation of food provision.                    Second, they also referred to another group's idea on the
same issue to confirm their decision.                     Furthermore, they described how we can develop GM foods to provide
good qualities of food products by citing an idea in a note by a group that had studied another issue, "Why are

                                                                            
they being developed?".    For group 14, the problem that they decided which position they should take toward
GM foods was not a simple choice by showing their preference, but they recognized the problem that they had to
consider different idea resources on GM foods to comprehensively understand GM foods.            In other discourses
identified as Level 4 question-based, we found the same tendency that students attempted to build structures of
arguments with ideas from multiple perspectives.
Discussion
In the first year of our design study, we implemented four pedagogical design principles to consider design
elements in a lesson plan on GM foods.       Our analysis on student learning activities showed some positive
findings and problems we have to further consider.    First, the analysis on the quality of discourse in notes on
Knowledge Forum® suggested that students succeeded in improving their quality of discourse as they proceeded
their learning. This phenomena is not expectable in ordinary classroom learning.      In the ordinary class, students
recognize that  they complete their learning in the end of the unit of a lesson. Therefore, students usually do not
have further questions on their study topic. In our designed lesson, students saw their learning as progressive
problem solving and continuously improved their discourse by generating higher qualities of questions.        As we
found in the ANOVA on frequencies of notes with different levels of questions, however, the tendency was not
sufficiently strong in that we could not find a significant differences in note frequencies with Level 3 and 4
questions between the first and the second stage.
  The descriptive analysis on students' discourse on Knowledge Forum® was conducted to further consider
how  more  students  can be  involved  in knowledge   building   discourse.    The result manifested    that students
identified to generate Level 4 questions in their discourse made use of multiple ideas by referring to other
groups' notes in different issues to construct arguments for their decision making.   Thus, design elements based
on our pedagogical principles (e.g., idea-centered discourse on Knowledge Forum®, and the activity and task
structure) did successfully scaffold student learning as knowledge building.

The Second Year's Design Study

The Classroom Description
In the second year, the same teacher was in charge of the lesson for another fifth grade classroom on GM foods.
The characteristics of students were considered to be similar to that in the first year.     Thirty-five students (18
females and 17 males) participated in the lesson as part of their curriculum through 35 class hours.
Progressive Refinement on the GM Foods Lesson
The refinement on the lesson plan was discussed by the design team from the two perspectives: (1) refinement
on our pedagogical design principles, and (2) refinement on design elements.     Based on results of our analysis in
the first year's design study, we concluded that our pedagogical design principles were effective but we could
further refine design elements for more students to engage in their learning as knowledge building.          Here, we
describe how we refined our design elements in the second year.
  Consequential task structure: From the GM foods conference to the consensus meeting.         In the first year, the
consequential task for students to challenge with their understanding on GM foods was how they as customers
deal with GM foods in their real life.    As we described in the section of the first year's design study, some
groups of students recognized that the task required them of exerting their epistemic agency for knowledge
building, i.e., monitoring what ideas  they  as a  classroom community      had   and considering  how   they   could
integrate different perspectives to advance their understanding. However, the task requirement was not found to
be articulate enough for most students to exert their epistemic agency.      In the second year, we changed the
consequential task from their decision making to the consensus making.      In our real life, the Ministry of Health,
Labour, and Welfare regularly opens the consensus meetings on GM foods for ordinary citizens.              The main
purpose of the consensus meetings is to articulate opinions customers have after learning about GM foods (i.e.,
This is what students did in the first year), and to consider what problems or issues should be further considered
and solutions to the problems. In the consensus meetings, there is a coordinator who should manage progressive
and productive   discourse by  customers  by  providing scientific  evidences    and  helping  them    organize their
arguments.  We introduced the concept of the consensus meeting to students and encouraged students to engage
in their learning by playing a role of coordinator of the consensus meeting.     Students were expected to consider
globally  multiple perspectives on GM     foods   and propose    solutions  to   problems customers    are   currently
concerned with.   Student activity required by the consensus task was considered to more directly elicit student
epistemic agency.
  Student learning activity structure: From three sub-projects to one big project.        In the first year, students
were divided into three sub-projects in each of which several groups of students conducted their research and
reported their ideas and information in their project view.  In the "GM foods conference" view, students were
expected to collect ideas from the three different views to make their reasoning for their positions toward GM
foods. The result of descriptive analysis on student discourse in the conference view manifested that only a few

                                                        
groups of students referred to ideas from multiple views.                      Thus, the result suggested that relatively large number
of students were not using their colleague's idea resources effectively.                      In the second year, therefore, we refined
the student activity structure by not dividing them into sub-projects but having them study on the basics of GM
foods in the single view and share ideas with each other.

"Consensus Meeting" view.                 With our designed scaffold labels for their discourse, students attempted to make
their reasoning by collecting ideas from their previous views as well as the current view.                           Since note numbers
produced by students in the two years were different, we did not directly compare mean frequencies of notes
with different levels of questions.            A comparisons of proportions of groups that produced discourse with Level 4
questions between the two years (six of fourteen groups in the first year vs. six of twelve groups in the second
year) did not manifest a significant difference,                      2 = .13, df = 1, p > .05.   A remarkable finding was, however,
seen   in the comparison             of   proportions      of  notes     in which    students  attempted   to  use   ideas  from multiple
perspectives by citing others' notes.                   Chi-square analysis of note numbers showed that students in the second
year produced significantly more notes considering multiple ideas (12 of 26 in the "Consensus Meeting" view)
than did those in the first year (8 of 58 in the "GM Foods Conference" view),                            2 = 10.36, df = 1, p < .01.  Thus,
it was found that more students exerted the epistemic agency for knowledge building in the second year.
Discussion
Our refinement on the lesson by improving design elements, particularly the consequential task structure and the
student activity structure, was found to be successful for improving student learning as knowledge building.                             In
the second year, the improvement of student discourse in their notes was more robust than that in the first year.
They did not only ask Level 1 question like "What is the genetically modified foods?" but also added more
argument to produce higher levels of questions.                         The difference in note numbers between the first half and
second half  was found in            the category of Level 4 questions.          As discussed previously, the new consequential task
requirement   to      propose        solutions  for      people with       different perspectives   to   make  their consensus   triggered
students' epistemic agency to integrate ideas from multiple perspectives.                         The result of the analysis on numbers
of notes in which students attempted to use multiple ideas supports our argument.                           In the "Consensus Meeting"
view, significantly more notes were produced including multiple ideas.                          The activity structure, one big project,
might  have students more easily reflect how the classroom                      proceeded their learning.     They did not need to switch
back and forth different views for monitoring what ideas their colleagues were interested in or worked on.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
Our design studies across two years were aimed at designing a lesson plan for knowledge building in the period
for the integrated study.            We transformed metaprinciples on knowledge building into four pedagogical design
principles for the classroom learning.                  The analyses manifested that our refinement on design elements based on
our pedagogical design principles succeeded in facilitating student learning as knowledge building from the first
year to the second.      In this section, we again go back to the metaprinciples for discussing how our pedagogical
design principles transformed the classroom into a knowledge building community.
  "Real Ideas, Authentic Problems," "Improvable Ideas," and "Idea Diversity."                                   Our   pedagogical    design

design across the two years.              Students started their learning with what they had already known on the study topic

                                                                            
then proceeded their learning based on their own ideas and others'.          Their ideas were externalized as discourse in
notes on Knowledge Forum® and shared for further knowledge advancement.
    "Rise  Above,"   "Epistemic    Agency,"     "Constructive     Uses   of  Authoritative Sources,"   and  "Knowledge
Building Discourse."     For triggering students' epistemic agency for knowledge building, we designed the lesson
so that students were required of expressing their ideas through their discourse in proceeding their learning with
the consequential  task.     In structuring    arguments  in   their discourse,  several   scaffold labels  (e.g., leading
sentences, and headers representing thinking steps) were introduced to students.           As a result, it was found that
students were more likely to engage in knowledge building discourse (identified as discourse with Level 4
questions) through our refinement on the task structure and the activity structure from the first year to the second
year.  In their knowledge building discourse, students were using scientific evidence or archives from book
references as conceptual artifacts (Bereiter, 2002) for advancing their reasoning.       However, structuring collective
ideas at the classroom as a whole  was still managed by    the teacher.      Students were encouraged to rise above their
individual group ideas by editing their views.    In the next step of our progressive refinement, we like to consider
design elements by which the teacher could take over the role of editing views (i.e., two-dimensional maps of
different groups' ideas in issues students are concerned with) to students themselves.         By sharing ideas in notes
on  Knowledge   Forum®,      students  were    found to  intentionally   engage  in such   an epistemic   discourse in     the
classroom as a whole.
    Table 1 shows an example of discourse seen in the classroom in 2002.              In the discourse happening in the
classroom,  students were    concerned   with   how   to report   their ideas  developed   through  their groupwork.        A
student (Student 1) raised an issue that her group had opposite ideas to each other on GM foods.           She told that it
was   problematic to report     ideas as groups.     The  teacher    accepted   her problem    in organizing  a    view    on
Knowledge Forum®, and further searched for ideas on how to solve the issue.                Student 4 proposed that they
were going to report individually based on their discussion in their groups.          What we found from the discourse
here is that students were acting as epistemic agents for their own learning.         This type of epistemic agency was
found  across the two    lesson  units frequently    but inconsistently.     Students considered how to proceed their
learning task by task, but did not consistently monitor a course of their learning in units.          We have to further
design elements so that students are naturally engaged in working on the management of their learning with their
ideas represented on the knowledge medium.        Editing the view may be a candidate element for us to ask them to
do for facilitating their epistemic agency.

                           Table 1. An Example of Discourse by Students in Discussing
                           How to Report Their Ideas in the GM Food Conference View.
Teacher      OK, [Student 1]. You have a question, don't you?

Student 1    Do you think that we are going to report ideas by groups?

Teacher      Yes, I do so.

Students 1   Well, if we are going to do so... When [Student 2] and I have the positive idea and [Student 3] has the oppositeone, do you think that we have to choose one of the two?

             That's a really good question.    I understand your concern very much.   It is reasonable for us to predict that
Teacher      members  in   a group will  have  opposite  ideas to each  other.  Some  says positive whereas the others     saynegative...
             Do you have an idea on how to solve this issue, [Student 4]?

Student 4    I have an idea related to the question by [Student 1]. If we have the opposite opinions to each other in a group.why do not we report our ideas as individuals on the GM Food Conference View?

             Oh, you said that we report individually.  It may be a way for us to go. I think that it is quite reasonable. Do
Teacher      all understand his idea?  He proposed that we are going to report ideas individually if we have opposite ideas
             to each other so that we cannot report one note as a group. ...

    "Community    Knowledge,      Collective    Responsibility,"     "Democratizing    Knowledge,"      and  "Symmetric
Knowledge Advancement."         The student activity structure with collaborative learning within and between small
groups made it more naturally possible for students to express their ideas to other members in their groups and
their group ideas to other groups either on Knowledge Forum® or in the classroom.              Our analysis of students'
discourse in highly qualified notes manifested that they attempted to refer to ideas from multiple sources, and to
take several different perspectives into consideration.
    "Pervasive Knowledge Building," and "Embedded and Transformative Assessment."                   The pervasiveness is
our final goal.  It is not reasonable to expect that students can always have their tendency to deal with their

                                                            
learning as knowledge building after their engagement in our designed lesson in such a short period of time (20-
30 class hours).  Therefore, we cannot evaluate if our design could satisfy this determinant.           One surprising
finding for us was that a few students reported how their learning in our designed lesson had been different from
those they were usually taking in the classroom in the post interview.      The assessment is another big issue for us
to consider  in the  next  refinement.   In our  design   studies in the reported    years, the assessment  activity by
students was designed by us.     The teacher encouraged students to do their self assessment on the progress in
their learning at the benchmark lessons.       The more ideal situation should be that students can propose their
colleagues or teacher to have opportunities to assess their progress through their regular monitoring.      This is the
highest level of metacognitive activity students can be involved in.        We need to figure out the developmental
trajectory of student epistemic agency for doing their own assessment through repeated refinement on our lesson.
