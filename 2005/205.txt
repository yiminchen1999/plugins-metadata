       Abstract. This paper discusses the character of the CSCL research community. While members of
       the community often feel they have authoritative perceptions of the nature of the community,
       these perceptions often  differ.  This paper  is  an attempt to   look  empirically  at the  CSCL
       community as constituted by leadership in the CSCL conferences. Data are included about who,
       historically, has published in the CSCL conferences and how those people are distributed across
       academic disciplines and regions of the world. In addition, the relationship between CSCL and the
       learning sciences is explored.

An old parable tells of three blind men trying to describe an elephant; one describes the ropy tail, another
describes the leg like a trunk of a tree, and a third describes the snake-like trunk. Disagreement ensued. All three
were locally correct, but all three were wrong in their incomplete view of the whole.
  Research fields can be like the elephant. Although participants in the communities might believe they have a
comprehensive   view of  the  shape   of the  whole community,   perceptions   are   shaped heavily by  personal
perspective. This can yield conflicts, when agendas or definitions for a research community are set. In this
paper, we attempt to describe some of the patterns of participation in the CSCL research community based on
empirical data derived from the CSCL conference proceedings from 1995 to 2002.

INTRODUCTION: THE SHAPE OF RESEARCH COMMUNITIES
What is a scientific community? How can we explore or define one? The most literal definition would be a
community, that is a group of people engaged in shared activities towards overlapping goals, doing science, or
systematically modeling and understanding the world. In the stereotypical ideal, the scientific community (only
one) is full of people who uncover truths and generally build on what is known about the world to answer
questions that are unknown.
  Unfortunately, this vision of a research community suggests a much tidier world than the one we live in.
First of all, there are many scientific communities, not just one monolithic one. Our "truths" are subject to
negotiation and reinterpretation, based not only on data, personal knowledge, and methodological inclinations,
but also biases, politics, and personal interests. (Kuhn, 1962; Latour, 1987) We are limited by our humanity, and
since our ability to understand and apply science is filtered through our own human capabilities, perhaps this is a
good thing. Scientific communities are messy.
  A further problem in asking about the nature of scientific communities is that the participants do not see
them clearly from a distant point of view; they live them. Debates can get quite heated when evidence suggests
ones' own interpretation of the world may be wrong, whether it is an interpretation of some scientific domain or
more personally an intepretation of one's own community and practices. People may simply reject ideas that
require radical interpretation of how things are (Chinn & Brewer, 1993).
  Still, it is a sign of a healthy community that is open to questioning itself, its motives, goals, and definitions,
even among scientists. As scientific communities progress, they make obsolete their prior interpretations of the
world, and this sometimes requires reframing the endeavor at hand. Just because the mission statement or
definition of a field might change is not a reason to abandon the endeavor entirely. Such definitions can become
a flag that can help rally communities towards common goals.
  Science is as science does. In prior work on defining scientific communities (Hoadley, 2004), I argued that
there are five core  features that define  research communities:  scope    and goals,  theoretical commitments,
epistemology, methods, and history. Each of these features leaves, to some extent, a trace in the literature of the
field. In this paper, I examine the CSCL literature represented by the CSCL conferences, and then attempt to use
this information to propose some characteristics of the CSCL community to date, while still recognizing that the
CSCL community is a living organism that changes every minute. While there are a number of other venues for
CSCL related work that exist, such as the CRIWG, the problems of source selection would be considerable

                                                       
if opened up to include additional sources. Rather than expand the scope of this study to first, determine, and
second, analyze, all CSCL-relevant conferences, this analysis focuses primarily on the CSCL conference itself.
    With  the  "moving    target"   in mind,  I  hope    to shed     some   light  on  a  few  questions   about  the  CSCL
community     as represented   by    the CSCL     conference.    First   of  all, who    participates? What   disciplines   or
geographic regions     do they come    from?    Do  they    stay in  the community       over time?   Secondly,  what   is the
relationship between the CSCL community and the community termed "the learning sciences"?

BIBLIOMETRIC              ANALYSIS
In this section, I undertake  a bibliometric analysis of the field of     CSCL     as represented  by  the CSCL    conference
series. Bibliometrics   may   be    used to  answer  basic   questions    about   scholarly   communication,     such as   who
publishes in   a field and how   much;   what    are the  connections    in  the  field  as  indicated by  variables  such  as
coauthorship or citation;  and who uses      a particular research literature for     what   purposes  (Borgman   &   Furner,
2002). The present analysis builds on a bibliometric analysis of the fields of learning sciences and instructional
systems  design   through  six publication    outlets  during    the time from    1991   to  2001 (Kirby,  Hoadley,   &  Carr-
Chellman,   in press). While   these   prior analyses  looked    at  cross-field  citations  and  geographic  distribution  of
coauthorship, the present   analysis   focuses   instead upon    who  participates  in   the CSCL   community,    where    they
come from, and the relationship between other outlets in the learning sciences and the CSCL conference.

Data    sources    and     coding
Our team collected and coded ten years of six publications judged (perhaps imperfectly) to be representative of
the learning sciences and of the instructional systems design community. Three of these publications were used
in the present analysis. From the learning sciences, the group collected and coded the two conference series and
the journal now   sponsored   by the   International   Society for the   Learning Sciences,      namely  the  Journal  of  the
Learning Sciences (begun in 1991), the proceedings of the International Conference for the Learning Sciences
(or ICLS,   also  started in  1991),   and   the proceedings     of  the  Computer     Supported   Collaborative    Learning
conference (begun in 1995). Additionally, the CSCL series is analysed through the January 2002 conference, in
part due to the fact that the conference was originally scheduled for late 2001. Note that this analysis does not
include the proceedings of EuroCSCL           2001, a    conference that     was   explicitly  regional  in  its focus.  This
omission is primarily due to logistical issues.
    While bibliographic statistics are often taken for granted in the era of bibliographic databases, our data
collection involved    enormous     effort.  Partly  due  to  the    recent  beginning   of   the various  learning   sciences
publication venues,    partly due   to the  variety of publishers    of  the works,   it took  nearly  a year to  assemble   a
complete set of materials. Original hard copies of the works were obtained, and the title pages and back matter
for each article were photocopied. The title page information was entered into a database, including article
citations and author affiliation information. We then coded author affiliations where provided geographically, by
country, state or province (for Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and city. Authors' names
were manually standardized. In some cases, missing affiliation information was omitted from the database (i.e.,
we did not attempt to uncover more affiliation than what was published, so for instance if an author address did
not contain departmental affiliation, no attempt was made to find out what department the author was from).
    Where  provided,   departmental    affiliations were    coded into  one  of   twelve categories (see  Table  1).  Authors
were coded into as many categories as applied, either because they changed departmental affiliations, or because
they had multiple affiliations.

    In addition to the authorship data, conference websites were used to identify program and steering committee
members for the CSCL conferences from 1995 to 2003, this time including the EuroCSCL conference (under

                                                              
the presumption that while participation in the conference might be regionally focused, editorial governance was
not). Where   websites  had  disappeared,   the  Internet archive was  used.   Unlike  the authors,   these  conference
organizers were tracked down using the best available current information, including Google searches.

Stability    of community        leadership
Our first analysis concerns the stability of the CSCL conference community core. Have people participated in
the community for years, or is it a "revolving door" which doesn't really represent a stable group of individuals
at all? We begin with an analysis of the program and steering committees. Overall, 226 people served on either
program or steering committees, 86 served on at least one steering committee, and 192 served on the program
committees. Of the 226 people on these committees, 92 participated in more than one role in the conference over
the years. Seventeen people served as either conference chair or program chair. They were counted automatically
as members of the steering committee.
    Of  the steering committee  members,    57  (roughly  2/3) served in another conference    capacity over  the years
(either another steering committee     or a program  committee.)  Of  the 29   people who  served  only   as a  steering
committee member once, all but a few (<5) were either at the host institution or local to the hosting institution
for the conference.  This seems   to indicate  a relatively high  degree  of stability at  the core of  the  conference
organizing community, although the location does clearly influence conference leadership.
    Among    program  committee   members,    84  (roughly  45%)   served the  conference  multiple   times  (either on
another program   committee   or as  a steering  committee  member).   Approximately    12  of  the people   who  only
served the conference once were local to the host institution, meaning in the same or nearby cities (although this
number is larger if Scandinavians are treated as local to each other). Thus, there were a much larger number of
program committee members who served the conference only once as a program committee member.
    Among both program and steering committee members, 70 served the conference over multiple years. The
average  timespan of  service for these   multi-year individuals  was 3.6 years.  Looking  through    the data, few  of
these people "dropped out" along the way. The maximum possible average based on the starting dates of each
individual is 4.9 years, indicating that those who were involved with more than one conference tended to stay
involved over a long period of time. 34 people served in 3 or more conference roles (see Table 2).

the 721   unique   authors    provided   enough    information   to   code   their  departmental

necessarily accurately represent the intellectual affiliations of         the   authors   when      a     Other             47
nonstandard affiliation was provided (for instance, an acronym specifying a laboratory
rather than  a    traditional academic    department).   Finally,   these  disciplinary    codes      mask    differences     within
disciplines. For   instance,  a   psychotherapist   and  a cognitive   neurologist    might    both    be  coded      as   the same
discipline if they both belonged to a psychology department.

Geographic         representation
    Where do CSCL conference presenters and leadership          come  from?   Is   CSCL    a   truly   international     conference?
Beginning    with  the   steering   and program    committees,   the  answer    is  a  qualified      yes. Of    the   226    people
identified, 129   (57%)  are  from   North  America   (US, Canada,    Mexico),   81   (36%)    are  from   Europe,       8  (4%)  are
from Asia, 6   (3%) from     Australia-Oceania, and   2   (1%)   from  South    America.     The   geographic     distribution      is
somewhat different for the 34 active participants in Table 2, where we see 17 (50%) from North America, 14
(41%) from Europe, and 3 (9%) from Asia.
    The authorship shows a similarly international pattern. Of the 343 papers analyzed, 258 were coauthored and
24 of these (9%) were collaborations of authors from multiple countries. These international collaborations are
listed below in Table 4.    If each authorship event is    taken separately  (i.e., we  analyze each       author     of each  paper
in the proceedings), we find 900 authorship events. Not all authors identified affiliations and locations (862 of
900),  but  when   they  did,    authorship was    spread  across  24  countries,     listed   below.     Here,   North     America
represents 64% of authorship, Europe 26%, Asia 8%, Australia-Oceania 2%, and South America 1%. See Table
5. Obviously,     these  results would   emphasize    European   participation  more   if  the   EuroCSCL         2001     had    been
included as well.

multidisciplinary     field. This    suggests  that    some   of   the potential      Mexico              5          0.58%
conflicts identified in Hoadley (2004)         may     apply    to CSCL      as  it   USA                 486        56.38%
matures,  including   theoretical,   methodological,     and    epistemological       North America       552        64.04%
conflicts. A   second   finding   is  that  CSCL    represents     an  extremely      Brazil              5          0.58%
wide geographic       diversity.  While     some   regions    (such    as  South      South America       5          0.58%
America and Australia-Oceania) are not heavily represented                in  this    Total               862        100.00%
dataset, the  breadth   of participation suggests      that further   support   of
international participation would meet an international interest in the field. Connection to regional conferences
in these areas might be one approach to solve this problem. Third, the data suggest that, for North Americans
CSCL is an outgrowth of the learning sciences, while for non-North Americans, it is not. This points out that
how CSCL is interpreted and practiced from a disciplinary sense may be highly contingent on local disciplinary
contexts.
    The  US    National    Academy     of    Sciences   recently    released    a   report   highlighting    the  importance        of
interdisciplinary  research,  and the  difficulties   such  research   faces  (Committee      on   Facilitating  Interdisciplinary
Research, 2005). The report identifies four drivers of interdisciplinary research: "the inherent complexity of
nature and society, the desire to explore problems and questions that are not confined to a single discipline, the
need  to   solve   societal   problems,      and   the   power     of  new    technologies."      (Committee      on  Facilitating
Interdisciplinary  Research, 2005, p.      2) Certainly,   many    in the  field  of CSCL     would   agree  that all four   drivers
apply to this field. CSCL studies complex interactions between natural (psychological, sociological) phenomena
and social   goals, works    on  problems     that cross social    sciences   and   computer    science, is  driven   by    complex
societal problems     such   as education,    and  is  directly    impacted   by    the  rapidly   shifting  technological       tools
available  to  us. The  report   suggests     barriers that  come     with   this   interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinary       work
requires both interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange. It also requires changing some of the organizational
and social structures   that  are supported    by  disciplines.    Interdisciplinarity  requires   extra effort  on  the    part of a
wide variety of stakeholders, ranging         from  funding organizations       to  academic  institutions   to  governmental       or
policymakers   to   students.   This  cross-disciplinary    effort  includes    working     towards   mutual    understanding       of
disciplinary methods, languages, and cultures.
    The  CSCL    community      faces additional   challenges    because   it is,  generally, an  international   phenomenon        as
well. Researchers in the field therefore must not only cross disciplinary methods, languages, and cultures, but
must also cross    national or   regional   methods,   languages,     and  cultures.  It is   all the more   surprising     that  the
CSCL community has become as international as the results suggest in the short span of its existence. Such
internationalism   is a testament to  not    only  the interest    produced   by   important  problems    of CSCL,    but    also   to
the deliberate   efforts   of   those in   the community        and   the community      leadership    to permit     and    promote
international activity. Obviously, the community builds on the strength of its North Atlantic ties, but should
make deliberate efforts to extend this participation to other regions; the presence of the CSCL conference in Asia
is an important step in this direction.

                                                                
  What    can  we  do with   these  results?  If CSCL    is  to succeed  in  the   future, it will  need  to overcome    the
challenges associated with interdisciplinary research, and to continue surmounting challenges posed by a global
reach. On   a personal level, this  might    include making     connections to  those  in  other disciplines and    building
relationships with other researchers across national boundaries. But, more subtly, these results also suggest that
members    of  the community    must     approach    governance,    reviewing,  and   other   evaluative   tasks with   full
knowledge that while each person might imagine that they have a relatively complete picture of the community,
this is actually quite unlikely. The debate over whether CSCL is related to the Learning Sciences is an example
of where the presumption that one knows one's own community can be fallacious.
  What will the future of the CSCL field look like? While future-gazing is by nature speculative, I can predict
that, based on prior stability of community leadership by solid scholars from multiple domains, the community
will continue to build on a successful tradition of valuable scholarship. Many questions remain, however. Will
the field come to represent a discipline unto itself, or will it continue to be a relatively porous grouping that
draws  on  people    from  multiple disciplines?   As    the community      continues  to  embrace   new   audiences   from
additional  geographic    regions,    it  is  likely  to  encounter     more  culture-clashes    from   different   regional
manifestations of disciplinary norms. However, this might provide not only a new burden of building common
ground, but   tremendous   fuel for cross-disciplinary    fertilization of  ideas. The   integration of   learning  sciences
concepts  and  community     into non-North    American      research  communities    is another   likely source  of cross-
pollination.  CSCL   seems   poised   to  bridge  these  gaps   via the  hundreds   of researchers  who    have  previously
attended and presented at both CSCL and ICLS conferences.
  As CSCL reaches its tenth birthday, it is important to realize that we are the blind men feeling our own
elephant. Important discourse must take place on the            characteristics that  make    CSCL   a    desirable research
community.    Given   the  huge   barriers   that are  already   being   surmounted--intercontinental        travel; cross-
disciplinary discussion, authorship, and review; and continuity of the community's leadership--it is clear that
CSCL   provides    a special and  valuable    venue  for researchers    whose   work   could  instead   be limited  to their
disciplines or localities. As we   explore   together our    theoretical commitments,      epistemologies,   methods,   and
goals, we can come to better understand our history--and our future.
