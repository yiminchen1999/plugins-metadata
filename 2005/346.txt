        Abstract.   We    describe  a collaborative    computer-based    activity as  a means   of developing
        argumentive discourse skills in middle-school students. The rationale for use of this technology is
        that it heightens   the  opportunity,  and  indeed   demand,   for  metacognitive    reflection  on  the
        communication,     relative  to direct verbal     exchange.   This   demand     is further    heightened
        procedurally   in  two  ways:   (a) each   dialog  takes place   among    four  participants, two   who
        collaborate in producing    and  transmitting   one side of  the dialog   and  two who   collaborate    in
        producing and transmitting the other; subsequently, the respective pairs engage in analysis of a
        written transcript of it, with the aim of identifying how it might be improved.

INTRODUCTION
Research on the development of inquiry and argument skills within developmental psychology remains largely
unconnected to efforts within the CSCL community to use technology to scaffold these skills (Weinberger &
Fischer, in press; Andriessen, Baker & Suthers, 2003; Hmelo-Silver, 2003). In describing our work to the CSCL
community, we attempt here to forge such a connection. We describe a method and preliminary findings that
have  evolved    from  work     with  middle-school    students  aimed   at  developing    intellectual  skills through
collaborative computer-based intervention (Kuhn, in press).      The microgenetic method (Kuhn, 1995; Siegler, in
press), in which close observation is undertaken of strategy changes as individuals engage repeatedly in the same
or similar tasks over time, is employed as an analytic tool. Initial work was focused on the development of
inquiry skills (Kuhn, 2001; Kuhn, Garcia-Mila, Zohar, and Andersen, 1995) and emphasized the ways in which
social collaboration can provide intellectual scaffolding at the metacognitive, as well as cognitive, level.    In other
words, a collaborator monitors and manages cognitive strategies for a partner in a way that the partner is not yet
able to do for  him or herself. In  a study by Andersen (reported by   Kuhn,  2001), over a period    of weeks students
worked on parallel inquiry problems, one by themselves and the other with a partner, allowing direct comparison
of performance and progress in the two conditions, and in a significant number of dyads the pair working
together exhibited superior strategy use to what either member of the pair showed when working alone.

ARGUMENT VERSUS ARGUMENTATION

In current work we are examining collaborative computer-based activity as a means of developing intellectual
skills of argument (Kuhn, in press).    While inquiry has been embraced as a curriculum goal throughout the US
science curriculum and to a large extent globally, argument by comparison has received relatively little attention
as an intellectual  skill.  Yet educators seeking to develop thinking skills would likely consider their efforts
largely successful  if students  became     proficient in advancing, critiquing,   and  defending  claims  in   reasoned
discussion with peers. There exists a good deal of theoretical literature on argument and argumentation (see van
Eemeren, Grootendorst, & Henkemans, 1996, for a sampling), but relatively little empirical evidence has been
available regarding argument skills, despite their considerable educational, as well as theoretical, significance
(Yeh, 2002).
   The terms argument and argumentation reflect the two senses in which the term argument is used, as
both product and process.      An individual constructs an argument to support a claim. The dialogic process in
which   two  or more   people   engage  in  debate of  opposing  claims  can be   referred to as  argumentation       or
argumentive      discourse to distinguish it from argument as product. Nonetheless, implicit in argument as
product is the advancement of a claim in a framework of evidence and counterclaims that is characteristic of
argumentive discourse, and the two kinds of argument are intricately related (Billig, 1987; Kuhn, 1991).            Most

                                                           
of the empirical research on argument has been devoted to argument as product.       Recently, however, this picture
has begun to change, reflected in a landmark special issue of the journal Discourse         Processes (Voss, 2001)
that contains articles on argumentive discourse and its development.

MAKING ARGUMENTATION AUTHENTIC

In our own initial research on young adolescents' argumentive discourse (Felton and Kuhn, 2001; Kuhn &
Udell,  2003;  Felton,  2004), the  weaknesses    observed in   dialogic argument    in  some   ways  resemble    those
observed   in individual  arguments,  with   only a   minority of  arguers going  beyond      exposition of their own
position.  Only infrequently do we see the genuine exchange that is the mark of authentic discourse.        Why might
this be?   Felton and Kuhn (2001) suggest that attention to the other person's ideas and their merits may create
cognitive overload, or it simply may not be recognized as part of the task.   Most likely, both factors are at work ­
both procedural and meta-level limitations constrain performance.
  As a result, dialogic argument is reduced to an activity curiously like that of individual argument.            The
objective is the same in both cases ­ to make the most compelling case possible as to the merits of one's
position.  If I do a good enough job, my position will prevail due to its merits, outshining any competitors, who
will merely fade away.    In the case of individual argument, the task is taken on as a solitary endeavor.      In the
case of    dialogic  argument, the task   is similarly  individual but   two  people    engage  in it simultaneously,
juxtaposing their respective efforts in a turn-taking format.
  A    number     of authors suggest  that   dialogic argument  is the   most viable    and   productive  medium   for
developing students' argument skills (Billig, 1987; Kuhn, 1991; Graff, 2003). When asked in expository writing
to generate an argument in support of a claim, too often, Graff (2003) suggests, a student undertakes to do so
with little or no sense of why anyone might want to claim otherwise. In the absence of a physically present
interlocutor, he goes on to propose, the student takes the task to be one of stringing together a sequence of true
statements,   avoiding  the  complication  of stating  anything   that might  not be    true.  The  result  is often a
communication in which both reader and writer, or audience and speaker, are left uncertain as to why the
argument needs to be made at all.
  An implication of these ideas is that students stand to develop stronger argument skills in the dialogic context
of argumentive discourse than they do in producing their own individual arguments in support of a claim.          This
is one of two key hypotheses addressed by our research.       Its rationale is twofold. Dialogic argument lies at the
heart of all argument, as noted.   In addition, and quite unlike expository argument, dialogic argument has the
advantage of building on the familiar form of everyday conversational exchange.
  Teachers may claim that their students have ample opportunities for dialogic argument in the context of
classroom discussions. Teachers conducting such discussions, however, commonly make one of two mistakes.
One of them is to allow the activity to relapse into nothing but consecutive self-expression, first on the part of
one student, then another. It does not matter much what each student says, and no student need listen to another.
In this worst-case scenario, the only attention the next student pays to the speaker is to wait to observe a signal
that this speaker is about to finish, so that he or she can begin. As long as everyone gets their share of turns to
speak and no one speaks too long, there is a wealth of opportunity for self-expression. Yet, no further purpose is
fulfilled. There is no continuity, no direction, no sequence to the discussion.   Nor is there any particular role for
the teacher to play except the procedural one of ensuring that the turn-taking norms are followed.
  The other mistake teachers make is to retain tight control of the activity so as to insure that the content of
what is said  meets the teacher's concept of what needs to be covered.   The teacher calls on students successively,
and if a student begins to veer off track, the teacher will steer him or her back, if necessary with a more specific
question ("Let me ask you this").    Or the teacher may simply go on to another student ­ a tactic even the best
teachers are guilty of ­ until some student gives the response the teacher is seeking.
  In   both   the self-expression and teacher-controlled  discussion   modes,  the same    model   of communication
prevails.  All talk is directed to the teacher (figure 1). The most the student can hope for in the way of response
is approval from the teacher for what he or she has said, before it becomes another student's turn to speak.
Whether or not the teacher communicates it explicitly to students, the teacher's own behavior models the norm
that we  must be  respectful of another's ideas, and students are usually quick to pick it up.  Hence,   students rarely
get any strong reactions to the statements they make in classroom discussion.        Instead, typical is the response
teachers so often rely on when they can think of nothing else, "That's an interesting idea, Jamie," before going
on to another student.

                                          S                                                                                 S

                                                                                  S                            S7

                                        Figure 1: Teacher-centered Discourse

   This form of communication stands in striking contrast to the discourse students will engage in as soon as
they leave the classroom and enter the schoolyard.                                    One student makes a claim, another challenges it, and others
join in (figure 2); strict reciprocity between any pair of participants is not expected, but, still, a speaker addresses
the claim that has just been made, with the goal of reaching a resolution. This discussion has a life that goes
beyond the role of individual participants. If interest is not keen enough to maintain the discussion, it evolves to
a new   topic  or  terminates.  Rarely  do                              participants             continue           to talk about  the topic without   talking  to  one
another within this goal-directed framework.                                      It is this feature of authentic talk to one another that we seek to
capture in students' dialogic arguments.

COMPUTERS AS A MEDIUM FOR ARGUMENT

We thus have adopted dialog about a disputed claim as a template for the development of students' argument
skills. The second key feature of our research is that this dialog take place via computer.                                                         The method takes
advantage of the fact that the middle-school sample we have worked with have acquired everyday familiarity
with email and instant messaging as a means of communication with peers and are comfortable with it.                                                               The
rationale for use of this technology in the present context is that it will heighten the opportunity, and indeed
demand,   for  metacognitive   reflection                               on the     communication                    (Kuhn,    2000,  2001),  relative to direct verbal
exchange.     As elaborated below, this demand is heightened procedurally in two ways: (a) each dialog takes place
among four participants, two who collaborate in producing and transmitting one side of the dialog and two who
collaborate in producing and transmitting the other; subsequent to the electronic dialog, the respective pairs
engage in analysis of a written transcript of it, with the aim of identifying how it might be improved.
   In   the   work  described  here, 28 sixth-grade                                  eleven-               and      twelve-year-old   students were    involved  in an
"Arguing    on  the Computer"   intervention                               that    took          place         over    the  course of 14 successive   45-minute  class
periods, twice per week. Students were introduced to the ColumbiaTown project, in which they were to debate
what    rules and   laws ColumbiaTown                                   should     have.            The        first   debate, they   were  told, was  about   whether
ColumbiaTown children should go to the town school or whether it's all right for the parents to teach them at
home if they want.

                                                                                                    
    BACKGROUND OF THE DEBATE
    "We're going to be working in this project on setting up a new town in an undeveloped area.    There will be
    lots of things to decide. One important issue that has come up right away is school for children.   A good
    school  has been  set up  that the parents and children  are happy  with.   All children attend through high
    school.  Since the houses are far apart, school gives children a chance to be together.
    A problem has come up.     The Costa family has moved to the edge of town from far away Greece with their
    11 year old son Nick.     Nick was a good student and soccer player back home in Greece.      Nick's parents
    have decided that in this new place, they want to keep Nick at home with them, and not have him ever be at
    the school with the other children.  The family speaks only Greek, and they think Nick will do better if he
    sticks to his family's language, and doesn't try to learn English. They say they can teach him everything he
    needs at home.
    What should happen?    Is it okay for the Costa family to live in the town but keep Nick at home, or should
   they send their son to the town school like all the other families do?"

AN E-BASED ARGUMENT INTERVENTION FOR MIDDLE-SCHOOLERS

The intervention activity consists of the following phases:

1.  Individual argument (Session 1)
Students' opinions and supporting arguments regarding the first topic are assessed individually using a paper-
and-pencil instrument (appendix B).

2.  Paired electronic arguments with opposing-view pair (sessions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10)
Students are paired with a classmate who holds the same view (home okay or school mandatory); these two
students collaborate in engaging in an e-dialog with another pair (in a different room) who holds the opposing
view. Pairs are instructed and reminded to collaborate with one another in constructing their input and, once in
agreement, to take turns typing it on the laptop the pair shares for the activity. Pairs engage a different opposing
pair for each new dialog.

3.  Reflective analysis of transcripts of previous e-arguments (sessions 5, 7, 9, 11).
After students have had the experience of several collaborative e-dialogs (sessions 2, 3, & 4), during session 5
they are presented the transcript of their previous e-dialog (session 4) and asked to reflect on it, using the "other-
argument" scaffold sheet provided for them (see figure 3), which elicits the other pair's main argument and the
counterargument they offered in their dialog and offers the opportunity to construct another, better argument.
(Students' attention is thus focused directly on the other side's arguments, for those students who have not yet
attended to them in the dialogs.) When all pairs have completed the sheet, sheets (and dialog transcripts) are
exchanged with another pair, who then review their classmates' sheet and offer comments (in particular with
respect to possible counterarguments.
   During session 7, presented the transcript from session 6, students are offered the "own-argument" scaffold
sheet (see figure 4).  When all are complete, each sheet is passed to another pair who reviews it and offers
suggestions (in particular with respect to possible "comebacks," i.e., rebuttals). During sessions 9 and 11, both
sheets are available and students are encouraged to complete both.

4.  Preparation for final, class-level e-argument
Session 12 marks the beginning of a culminating activity for students with respect to the topic.   Students work
within their same-side rooms, preparing for what will be a final "show down" debate at session 14. The pairs
who have worked collaboratively to this point are now divided, one assigned to the other-side team and the other
to the own-side team.   Within each team, students' task is to focus either on other-side argument (and best
counterarguments), in the case of the first team, or to focus on own-side arguments (and best comebacks to
counterarguments) in the case of the second team.    (Students thereby experience directly the dual functions of
argument.)  The teams use their laptops to collaboratively compile an e-folder containing a portfolio of the best
own-side argument (and comebacks), for use in the showdown or (in the case of the other team) an e-folder
containing a portfolio of likely other-side arguments (and best counterarguments). All previous scaffold sheets
are available (as well as dialog transcripts) for students to consult if they wish. This activity is continued in
session 13.

                                                       
5.   Execution of final class-level e-argument (Session 14).
In session 14, students in each room are divided into a red and a blue team of approximate equal skill (and equal
numbers of own-side and other-side specialists from the preceding activity).     The final debate is conducted as an
e-dialog between the two classes, projected onto a Smartboard, with the red team presiding for the first half of
the debate and the blue team for the second  half. (Various other procedural rules govern the   activity.)

6.   Judging and feedback
A transcript of the final debate is analyzed and an argument map prepared, diagramming all arguments, and all
counterargument  and   rebuttals, on  either side, that connect  directly  in  the dialog flow to their corresponding
arguments.   A point   system  is then  applied, to  declare  a winning  team.     The argument  map  and   outcome    is
presented to all participants for their examination.

CONCLUSIONS

In sum, the present method incorporates successful elements of previous methods we have used in seeking to
develop argument skills, a dyadic discourse element (Felton & Kuhn, 2001) and a goal-based element (Kuhn &
Udell, 2003).  In addition, and most significant, we have drawn on the availability of, and students' familiarity
with, laptop computers to employ an electronic medium in which to situate discourse.         This electronic medium,
together with the socially collaborative context, we believe promotes the opportunity for reflection that scaffolds
the development of meta-level cognitive skills.      In stark contrast  to the immediate   response  required  in live
discourse, electronic discourse enables one to contemplate both what one's conversational partner has said and
what it is possible to say in response. A collaborative partner sharing the conversational role further heightens
the demand for and likelihood of this reflection.
   Our microgenetic analyses of dialog transcripts show rapid evolution in the quality of dialogs, as well as the
quantity of discourse.  The percentage of dialog devoted to off-task concerns rapidly diminishes as does the
percentage devoted to meta-task utterances that are ineffective in furthering the argument.     Such utterances, for
example, progress from "You're being obnoxious" to "You're not giving a reason for your opinion."                 Our
previous work  applying  a   dialogic coding   scheme   (Felton  & Kuhn,    2001;  Kuhn   &  Udell, 2003)   to dialog
transcripts has shown the major developmental changes to occur in an increased usage of counterarguments and
a  decreased usage of  statements    explicating one's  own   position. A  study   by Felton (2004)  documents    that
intervention involving metacognitive reflection enhances this process. Although analysis of data from the study
described here is not complete, these same trends are evident.    In continuing work, it remains for us to establish
that gains are not  limited   to  intervention   argument topics  and   are maintained    over time.  We    are   also
investigating the extent to which continuing intervention of the sort described induces further gain beyond that
observed in an initial intervention. Alternatively, we may observe an asymptote following an initial intervention.
This question has important instructional implications.    Still a further question that has important educational
implications and warrants investigation is the extent to which the observed gains transfer to individual (non-
dialogic) arguments students make either verbally or in their expository writing.     We look forward to addressing
all of these in future work.
