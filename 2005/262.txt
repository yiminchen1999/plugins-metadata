      Abstract.  Ten   years  of  international CSCL    conferences  give   proper reason   to reflect on the
      development of the CSCL community. Based on an analysis of conference proceedings, lists of
      participants  and lists of  program  committee    members,    this paper provides   insights about  the
      development of the CSCL community in its first decade. A focus is set on the continuity of active
      and passive membership, the geographical distribution and the international connectivity of the
      community.
      Contrary to our expectations, only a relatively small number of people participate continuously in
      the   community.  Concerning    the geographical    distribution   we found   that the   community    is
      increasingly  international  in conference    participation, authors, and   program   committees.   The
      international connectivity of the community is also increasing which can be seen in a growing
      number of citations and co-authorships across different countries. These results can serve as a
      basis for further cultivation of the CSCL community.

      Keywords: CSCL community, community analysis, citation analysis, social network analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Since the first workshop in 1989 (Acquafredda di Maratea, Italy; documented in O'Malley (1995)) a growing
number of researchers participates in the CSCL community. An international conference series started in 1995,
which includes up to now six past and an upcoming conference in 2005. Because of the growing interest on the
work of this community an international journal of CSCL (ijCSCL) in printed and online (www.ijCSCL.org)
form was founded in 2004. In this paper we present an analysis of the CSCL community over the past ten years
to provide a basis for joint reflection which could influence the communities' further development.
   The CSCL community can be defined as a scientific community of practice (Kienle & Wessner, 2005). The
term "Communities of Practice" coined by Lave and Wenger (1991) has been defined as "groups of people who
share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in
this area by interacting on an ongoing basis" (Wenger et al., 2002, p. 4). Based on this definition a scientific
community ­ in general as well as the CSCL community ­ is a community of practice with members working in
a common field of research but being distributed across disciplines, organizations, cultures and geographical
regions. For  their exchange   the  members     use  a combination   of  face  to  face meetings   and  increasingly
technology-mediated interaction. This results in a heterogeneous group in which members have different views
on the (CSCL) community and its main players. Methods used are from a variety of disciplines and scientific
cultures. Members follow or even combine practice of basic and applied research (Fischer et al., 2003). For the
CSCL  community,    the development    of a common      theory which   integrates  the  foundations of  the relevant
disciplines is ongoing (Stahl, 2002a; Puntambekar & Young, 2003).
   In this paper we present an analysis of the CSCL community and its development over the past ten years. We
are interested in whether the community coalesces or is a set of ­ maybe overlapping ­ sub communities with a
special focus on internationality. In more detail, we pose the following research questions:
1.  Development: How does active and passive membership in the community develop?
2.  Continuity:
         a.  Do members stay in the community?
         b.  Are new people joining the community and becoming active members?
3.  Connection:    How  do    the members   of   the   community   connect  over   regional boundaries?   Does   the
    connectivity grow over the years?

                                                         
   An informal survey among participants and authors of previous CSCL conferences pointed out that the
following results would be expected for the CSCL community:
1.  Authors contribute to conferences on a regular basis.
2.  A larger percentage of members attend most conferences; in addition there is a sound balance between
    recurring people and newcomers.
3.  The connection over regional boundaries is growing.

This paper tries to provide an objective view on the development and continuity of the CSCL community as well
as on the connections in the community. In the following, we describe the methods and data used in our analysis
(section 2) and the main results concerning the research questions above (section 3). Based on the results of our
analysis we identify issues for further development of the CSCL community (section 4).

METHOD AND DATA
The analysis of scientific communities often builds on bibliometric and social network approaches. Bibliometric
approaches are based on the publications of a community and focus on networks of papers linked by citations.
Applicable methods include citation analysis (Garfield, 1979), bibliometric coupling (Kessler, 1963) and co-
citation analysis (Small, 1973). Citation analysis looks at the citations in publications and constructs networks
between publications. Bibliometric coupling regards two publications are related to the extent they are both
together cited in other publications. Co-citation analysis works the other way; two papers are connected to the
extent they cite the same publications. Such analyses have been done for fields such as DNA (Garfield et al.,
1964), Hypertext (Chen & Carr, 1999), or Information Science (White & McCain, 1998).
   Social network    approaches (Scott, 1991) to     scientific communities  are based   on the  members    of a
community and focus on networks of people linked for example by co-authorship. It utilizes measures such as
connectedness, diameter, centralization and density of a community. This has been applied to a number of
research fields, too (see Newmann (2004) for an overview). Social network analysis has been applied also in the
CSCL community in order to measure the cohesion in collaborative learning teams (Nurmela et al., 1999;
Woodruff, 1999; Cho et al., 2002; Nurmela et al., 2003; Reffay & Chanier, 2003).
   Both approaches, bibliometric as well as social network analysis, are used for a formal quantitative analysis
of the publications produced by a group and the relationships among publications as well as among members.
Especially in academic disciplines where the importance of publication and citation are high, co-authorship and
references in the publications can be seen as an indicator of how well members of a field are connected.
   For the analysis of the CSCL community we combine several approaches. We perform a citation and co-
authorship analysis of the artefacts in CSCL conference proceedings and analyze other sources including the
lists of participants and lists of program committee members.
   Data for our citation analysis was mainly gathered from the proceedings of the six CSCL conferences in
1995 1997 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2003 (Schnase et al., 1995; Hall et al., 1997; Hoadley & Roschelle, 1999;
Dillenbourg et al., 2001; Stahl, 2002; Wasson et al., 2003, Wasson et al., 2003a). Additionally all program
committees (CSCL 1995 ­ 2005) and all available lists of participation (CSCL 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2003) were
analyzed. All together we included 692 artifacts (e.g. poster, papers), 125 program committee members (PC
members; PCM), 1187 authors and 1462 conference participants in our analysis. PC members, authors and
participants together form members of the community. For all members of the CSCL community we recorded
the following data:
x   Name
x   Country and continent. This data enables us to analyse the distribution of the community.
x   Conference  in   which  she/he participated     as member     of the program  committee,  as  author,  or  as
    conference participant. On basis of this data we analysed the continuity of the community and transitions
    between the different degrees of participation.

In addition, we recorded the discipline for some participants. Unfortunately, a web search did not provide
sufficient answers for most members of the community.
   While recording the data we took change of name, typos etc. into account if we could detect or knew about
them. The lists of participation we got from the conference organizers were not exhaustive as participants
registering on site of the conferences were not included.
   For a further analysis of the authors, we recorded for each author contributing to at least three conferences
the following data:
x   Co-authors for the analysis of (strong) interaction between the participants of the community
x   Referenced authors for the analysis of (weak) interaction between the participants. From the citations of
    each artifact we picked those people who participated at least once as an author.

                                                       
To analyze the data concerning the three research questions we carry out the following steps:
x    Development:    For  each conference    we   analyze              the absolute     number    of participants,    authors    and    PC
     members. For the authors and PC members we also analyze the regional distribution. The comparison of the
     data for each year enables us to characterize the development of the community.
x    Continuity:  For  each  author/PCM      and conference             we    analyze    if she/he   participates    for    the first  or a
     repeated time. This enables us to show for each conference the number of new and recurring members. The
     comparison enables us to assess the continuity of the CSCL community. For each member we evaluate at
     how many conferences she/he participated.
x    Connections in the community: We take those connections between members of the community into
     account which can be found in the artifacts printed in the proceedings. These are references as a weak
     connection  and  co-authorships  as   a strong   connection.              The focus     on   artifacts is justified     because    the
     artifacts represent a major part of what is communicated during the conference and between conferences -
     as a community memory for its members and as a source for new people joining the community. These
     artifacts are considered highly valuable to the community by the community itself (via the review process)
     and serve as a basis for communication in the community. As we are interested in the connections in the
     community we focus on references to authors inside the community. For co-authorship we limit our analysis
     to the more active authors, contributing to three ore more conferences.

authors  and  PC  members     as  active
members of the community. As the granularity of analysis we selected continents. In figure 2 we see at the left
side the   composition of authors  at the    six past CSCL              conferences.     Participation     of European       authors   was
strongest in those years where the conference took place in Europe. Participation of North American authors
was strongest in the all other years where the conference took place in North America. Interestingly, following
the first conference in Europe (2001) the share of European authors increased also in the following conference
(2002) in North America. This means that a small but substantial percentage of the authors not only enter the
community when the conference is located nearby but stay from there on for a while in the community, i.e.
continue to participate in following conferences.

                                   Figure 2: Distribution of authors and PC members by continents

The distribution of authors a is quite similar to the geographical distribution of the PC (see right side of figure
2). The similarity can be explained by rotation of meeting places and international composition of program
committees. A study concerning the International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) shows the same
relation in a different direction: No rotation of meeting places and program committees with members mainly
from one country corresponds with a low degree of internationality in the group of authors (Kirby et al., in
press).

contributed to at least two
conferences, and only 7.4% of authors (88 out of 1187) contributed to at least half of all passed conferences
(three or more). The distribution of PC members point into the same direction but shows more continuity for this
group: 50% of all PC members were involved in only one conference. As we have participation data for four
conferences only, the percentages for participants are not fully comparable to the other two groups. But we see a
similar distribution here: 68.5% of participants attend only one conference and only 15 persons were present at
each of the last four conferences.
   Based on these findings we started a first deeper analysis which shows the quotient of new and recurring
authors and PC members for each conference. The results are shown in figure 4. For both groups ­ authors and
PC members ­ the absolute number and the quotient seem to stabilize. For the PC members, the absolute number
is around 50 ­ 60, the number of new PC members at around 20 (or 33% of all PC members for a given year).
For the group of authors, the absolute number is around 350-400, the number of new authors at around 230-250
(or 66 % of all authors of a given year). This indicates for both groups a relatively stable quotient of "old boys"
who know and represent the existing ideas of the community and "newcomers" who bring new ideas to the
group. However, the part of newcomers in the group of authors is higher than in the group of PC members.

A second deeper analysis concerns the "key player" of the community: we take a closer look on those members
who participated as authors or PC members in three or more conferences. Table 1 lists those authors and PC
members who participated in four or more conferences. One interesting point is that the intersection of those two
groups is relatively small (see the names in italics in table 1). Based on this result we added those authors and
PC members which participated in three conferences. Figure 5 shows their distribution sorted by continents.
This reveals a higher continuous engagement of North Americans in the Program Committees on the one hand,
and more continuously active authors from Europe on the other hand.

Connections in the community
Connections in the community can be found by analyzing references and co-authorships. First we look at the
references which we rate as a weaker connection than co-authorships. Figure 6 shows the references for the
1995 conference, figure 7 for the one in 2003. The figures include the references to all authors in the community
in artifacts of the Top-88 authors (who contributed to at least three conferences). At a first glance it is seen that
the number of nodes (=authors + referenced authors) increases from 1995 to 2003. This is not surprising because
the number of   authors   increases     and more        CSCL related papers   exist,  e.g.       in proceedings   of  previous
conferences. But the interesting point in these figures is the growing number of international references. While
in 1995 most references are national, in 2003 international subgroups arise. Concerning the large network in the
middle of figure 7 it should be pointed out that national sub-groups (e.g. from France, Greece, Finland, Sweden,
Canada, USA) grow together by referring to the same authors.

                                         Figure 7: References in 2003

In a second step we try to verify this observation of growing international connection by analyzing the co-
authorships which we rate as a stronger connection than references. Figure 8 compares the co-authorships of
1995 and 2003 on the abstraction level of countries concerning the papers (and co-authors) of the Top-88
authors. This data confirms the observation of growing international connection above. Here ­ as well as in the
case of references ­ not only the number of nodes increases but also the international connectivity grows.
   For 2003 we emphasize the close connection between authors from UK and Denmark (9+8 co-authorships)
as well as from    USA  and Germany    (8+8 co-authorships).   A further interesting point is the large,  national
number of Finish co-authorships (61). This indicates a close meshed network with less connection to other
countries though the view on the references (figure 6) suggests that finish authors are well positioned in the
international (weaker) network of references.
   To sum up, these findings support the assumption that the connectivity over regional boundaries grew over
the last 10 years.

CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK
In this paper we presented an analysis of the CSCL community concerning its development and continuity as
well as the connectivity. This analysis is based on a mix of several approaches: we performed a citation and co-
authorship analysis of CSCL conference proceedings and analyzed other sources including lists of participants
and lists of program committee members. Most data confirm that the CSCL community is a lively and growing
community with a small core group of recurring authors and PC members. In detail we showed that the group of
authors (as active members of the community) grew and the group size of the PC members stabilized.
  Furthermore the data revealed that the international distribution of the community members grows. This is
caused by the rotation of meeting locations and the international composition of the PC members. The relation to
the different meeting places is given because we were able to show that new people who live nearby the
conference location entered the community and a substantial percentage of them also participated in a following
conference. The       relation   to    the group        of   PC      members    is    derived     from   a comparison to           a citation     analysis
concerning the International Conference of the Learning Sciences (ICLS) (Kirby et al., in press). It showed the
same relation between PC members and internationality in a different direction: a program committee with
members from one country only corresponds with a low degree of internationality in the group of authors. The
community, especially the members in the core of the community should be aware of the data presented here as
a basis for decisions about meeting locations, composition of program and other committees etc. In addition the
data could provide help to predict future characteristics of the CSCL community, for example participation
numbers for         upcoming    conferences.           To    sum       up, for   further    development       of the CSCL             community        we
recommend that the internationality in the program committee as well as the rotation of meeting locations should
be maintained.
  The international connectivity of the community is also increasing which can be seen in a growing number
of citations and co-authorships across different countries. In order to support the international connectivity in the
community authors should take opportunities to work with people from other regions and share the results in
(co-authored) papers.

                                                                            
   A  problem   might  be seen  in the  relatively  high   share of  participants, authors,  and  PC  members who
participate in or contribute to only   one   conference.   The data  showed  that   the quotient  between new  and
recurring authors and PC members started to stabilize - for PC members 33% are newcomers, for authors 66 %.
The part of recurring authors seems to be quite low. As authors and their products play a very important role in
the development of the community, this should be increased. In order to increase the probability that people
come back to later conferences, the core group might think about measurements to increase the identification of
members with the community. Pragmatically, members could be asked via email or during a CSCL conference
to discuss issues related to the continuous participation in the community.
   The work reported in this paper aims at providing a basis for an ongoing analysis of the CSCL community
and for the design of its future. Possible extensions include:
x   Updating the data for each new CSCL conferences in order to provide current data on its development to
    the community.
x   Recording also references and co-authorships of authors with only one or two participations in order to
    learn more about the less active authors and how they are distributed and connected in the community.
x   Splitting up the artefacts in posters, short and full papers for a more fine-grained analysis of development,
    continuity and connectivity of the community. (It could make sense to include also submissions which have
    been rejected, e.g. because of space limitations in the conference program.)
x   Further  specifying citations, e.g.  in  order to identify   the publication   types, series or even  individual
    publications which are most influential to the community.
x   Including information about disciplines of participants, authors and PC members in order to analyze the
    multi-/interdisciplinarity of the community.
x   Performing a social network analysis in order to identify for example subgroups and cliques. Following
    more elaborated analysis methods (e.g., Chen & Carr, 1999), major research fronts and the evolution of
    ideas, research topics or methodologies in the community can be identified.

The approach taken here, a combination of citation and co-authorship analysis and the analysis of other sources
such as lists of participants, authors and PC members should also be applicable to other scientific communities.
