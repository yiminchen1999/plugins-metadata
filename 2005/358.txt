       Abstract. This paper reports an investigation of how students' literacy improved through on-line
       discourse. Two    English    literature classes  in                           an inner    city  multicultural   secondary    school
       participated. The teacher taught both classes-an experimental and a control class. The experimental
       group was a class of Grade 9 students with access to the discourse space, Knowledge Forum®,
       for writing  narrative   and expository  texts, critiquing                          others'     texts, and  exploring  ideas.  The
       control class did not have access to Knowledge Forum. Overall, discourse in the database resulted
       in improved   literacy,  a positive correlation between                          database    activity  and final grades, and   to a
       more harmonious classroom culture.

       Keywords: literacy, dialogue, knowledge building

INTRODUCTION
In North America, 25 percent of students are reading at "below basic" levels meaning that they are unable to
understand or comprehend advanced material (OECD-OCDE, 2000). Fewer than 5% of the adolescents in the
American NAEP 1998 assessment could extend or elaborate the meanings of the materials they read. The NAEP
writing assessments  also  indicated  that few adolescents                           could    write effective  pieces  with sufficient details to
support main points (Donahue, Voelkl, Campbell, & Mazzeo, 1999; Moore, Bean, Birdyshaw, Rycik, 1999).
This is an appalling finding given that students have been reading and writing in school for many years before
these  assessments.   The    increasing    complexity   of                           knowledge      in every   domain   increasingly     demands
sophisticated abilities  for composing   and   comprehending                            written  text   (NICHD,    2000).   Clearly, adolescents'
literacy skills are not keeping pace with the societal demands of living in a rapidly changing knowledge age
(Senge, 2000). Research indicates several reasons for low literacy all centering on the nature of classroom
discourse.  Discourse is  central  to knowledge    creation                          because  it is  the  means    through  which   knowledge  is
formed, criticized, and amended (Scardamalia, Bereiter & Lamon, 1994).

   Although several studies have indicated that meaningful discourse is the most relevant classroom variable
for increasing literacy, this practice is not pervasive in schools (Applebee, 1996; Greenleaf, Jimenez & Roller,
2002). Unlike    conventional    conversation  or  dialogue                            in  professional   communities,      classroom    discourse
typically conforms to a participation structure controlled by the teacher. Teachers ask most of the questions, call
on students  to answer and allocate turns    (Greenleaf &                            Freedman,    1993).  The    discourse  between   teacher and
students  is then limited    to an  IRE  (inquire, respond,                            evaluate)    structure  for the  purpose   of transmitting
information  (Cazden,   1988)   where the  teacher already                           knows the   answer.  Additionally,    adolescents'  evolving
expertise in coping with routine school literacy tasks with the least amount of time or effort (Scardamalia et al,
1994) suggests the need to involve students in higher level thinking about what they read and write than is
possible  within  a transmission    model   of teaching,   with                           its emphasis    on   skill and   drill, teacher-centered
instruction, and passive learning. However, this 'knowledge transmission' model has had a very strong hold in
classrooms for decades (Cuban, 1993). In these environments, students have little chance of becoming heard or
recognized as contributing participants. As the NAEP and other results indicate student achievement with this
kind of discourse does not promote reading for comprehension or writing for communication.

   Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) distinguished two types of discourse: knowledge telling and knowledge
transforming.    Knowledge telling is a traditional discourse used to support teaching-learning interactions, such
as the  IRE   structure. A   knowledge     transforming strategy                           treats   discourse   as problem   solving,    an active
reworking of thoughts. Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) were reporting on the process of writing, which is also
a form of discourse and one central   to assessments   of  reading                         comprehension1.      Carbonaro   and   Gamoran   (1999)
found  that  the more    teachers  emphasized   both   literature                         and    analytical   writing,  the higher   the   average
achievement   growth    of their  students; conversely,    students                           tended   to gain   the least  when   their teachers

1 For example, The NAEP reading assessments require written responses from students.

                                                          
emphasized   grammar. Nystrand     (1997)   showed   that greater  levels  of  coherence   among    reading,  writing,  and
classroom discourse promoted higher achievement.

   Knowledge     building    communities      (Scardamalia    et al, 1994),    and  learning   communities      (Brown   &
Campione, 1996) approaches to teaching and learning provide ways to integrate reading, writing, and dialogue
as often  as possible   across all subject    domains   since  each  of  these  activities reinforces    the  other. These
participatory methods actively engage students in their own learning and provide opportunities for substantive
interaction among students as well as with the teacher. In these classrooms, learners focus on cognitive goals,
structural features of a problem and use a knowledge transforming strategy (e.g., Lamon, Chan, Scardamalia,
Burtis, &  Brett,  1992).   That   is, they are  intentional  in  how   they   approach   learning.   Unlike    Brown   and
Campione's learning communities approach, knowledge building communities make use of information and
communications technology that affords communication without restrictions of time and space, and encourages
dynamic, democratic, and creative dialogue.

Technology         affordances
A recognition that students need to actively construct their own knowledge by their bootstraps (Scardamalia &
Bereiter, 1987)  led to  the development      of  a multimedia    communal     database  application   called   Knowledge
Forum® (formerly Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments/CSILE). Knowledge Forum is an
online environment where participants contribute ideas, ask questions, read what others have written, challenge
ideas, and build upon them      to advance their    community's    knowledge.      Like  other  asynchronous     conference
systems,  participants  can interact   at any time  and from   any place.   Unlike  other  systems,    Knowledge     Forum
provides  views  or working   spaces   enabling  people to see   and  adjust   the structure  of their  discourse   making
thinking  visible. The  software   also   provides  customizable   scaffold   supports;  external   prompts   that  support
cognition while the learner is in the process of creating increasingly complex structures (Bruner, 1983). Scaffold
supports encourage   students to reflect on their cognitive processes      as  they  are thinking,    reading   and  writing
(Chan & Van Aalst, 2004).

   The  software   also supports   student-to-student   dialogue   that is not directly   mediated    by the  teacher   thus
averting the problem of teacher-centred dialogue prevalent in traditional classrooms. Peers provide much of the
procedural facilitation in their database by making connections between their understanding and others' ideas,
with what is known in other disciplines, and with world knowledge.           Confrontation with     a variety of  ideas and
arguments promotes deeper reflection and enhances coherent        explanations,    because of the   increased visibility of
different ideas and how they change (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1993). Since students must communicate through
reading and writing improved literacy is a by-product of working with ideas (Lamon, Andrews & Scardamalia,
2004).

Teacher      and   classroom       affordances
As Owston    (1997) has  noted   the   potential of new technologies for    learning is  likely  to be  found   not  in  the
technologies themselves but in the way in which these technologies are used as tools for learning. In classrooms
where database discourse is supported by knowledge building pedagogy: "the teacher's role shifts from standing
outside the learning process and guiding it to participating actively in the learning process and leading by virtue
of being a more expert learner" (Bereiter &      Scardamalia, 1993,  p.  211).  In these classrooms, the teacher turns
more and more responsibility for learning over to students. Students define what needs to be learned, monitor
their own progress and decide what to do when progress isn't being made.

   Mr. K., the teacher, had used the software in the previous year for writing projects; but students in that class
used the database as an informal chat space (Klonsky, 2001). In his second year using the database, Mr. K.'s
goal was to use the database to foster students' ability to move beyond chats to online collaboration and as a
mechanism    for formative   assessment.    Collins  (1992)   has suggested    that assessment    should    shift  from  an
emphasis on traditional summative evaluation (in which data is acquired at the end of an activity) to include
more formative design approaches (which are informed by data acquired during the planning and development of
the activity). For example, providing adolescents who are experiencing reading difficulties with clear goals and
then giving  feedback on the    progress   they  are making    can lead  to  increased  self-efficacy  and   greater use of
comprehension strategies (Schunk & Rice, 1993).

It is important to note that the software is designed to support knowledge building communities. A knowledge
building community is similar to a research community where members share responsibility for creating new
knowledge. Participants set out their theories and ideas approaching information from various viewpoints; they
consider how well diverse theories account for information; whether one theory provides a better account than
another; whether complexity and parsimony are dealt with and so through discourse progressively improve their
understanding.   In this way,  the community      produces cultural  artifacts (Bereiter,  2002) of   value  to themselves
and  others; success    then is  a result   of   contributions   distributed  across all   members     rather   than being

                                                           
concentrated in a leader. A knowledge building community is guided by a system of 12 knowledge building
principles shown in Table 1 below. Teachers' adotpion and appropriation of a knowledge building philosophy
shows a developmental trajectory (Lamon, 2005); and will be explored in this paper.

 Knowledge building principles         Definitions
 Real ideas and authentic problems     Real knowledge problems arise from efforts to understand the world;
                                       creative work with ideas supports faster and more reliable learning,
                                       whereas learning alone seldom leads to knowledge innovation
 Idea diversity                        Different ideas create a dynamic environment in which contrasts,
                                       competition, and complementarity of ideas is evident, creating a rich
                                       environment for ideas to evolve into new and more refined forms
 Improvable ideas                      All ideas are treated as improvable; participants aim to mirror the work
                                       of great thinkers in gathering and weighing evidence, and ensuring that
                                       explanations cohere with all available evidence
 Knowledge building discourse          Discourse serves to identify shared problems and gaps in understanding
                                       and to advance understanding beyond the level of the most
                                       knowledgeable individual.
 Epistemic agency                      Participants mobilize personal strengths to set forth their ideas and to
                                       negotiate a fit between personal ideas and ideas of others, using
                                       contrasts to spark and sustain knowledge advancement rather than
                                       depending on others to chart that course for them
 Democratizing knowledge               All participants are legitimate contributors to the shared goals of the
                                       community; all have a sense of ownership of knowledge advances
                                       achieved by the group
 Collective knowledge, community       Participants take responsibility for the overall advancement of
 responsibility                        knowledge in the community.
 Embedded transformative               The community engages in its own internal assessment, which is both
 assessment                            more fine-tuned and rigorous than external assessment, and serves to
                                       ensure that the community's work will exceed the expectations of
                                       external assessors
 Constructive use of authoritative     Participants use authoritative sources, along with other information
 sources                               sources as data for their own knowledge building and idea-improving
                                       processes.
 Rise ­ above                          The conditions to which people change because of the successes of
                                       other people in the environment. Adapting means adapting to a

 Pervasive knowledge building          Creative work with ideas is integral to all knowledge work.

                                       community dynamics that serve to embed ideas in a broader social

Effects   of  technology       on  student    self-concept     and  attitudes      about    literacy
Desktop  publishing,  web  publishing, and  e-mail have   made  it possible   for students  to write for real  and
extended audiences. According to numerous reports, this is a great motivator and encourages students to take
greater care with their writing. Technology environments heighten students' motivation to become independent
readers and writers and thereby increase their sense of competency (Kamil, Intrator, & Kim, 2000). Working in
a technology supported classroom increases motivation. Beach and Lundell (1998) found that the information
and communications     technology   encourages   participation from  students     who  tend to   shy  away  from
participating in face-to-face discussions, and can facilitate the free expression of alternate views. They noted how
these social contexts  require adolescents to contribute in ways   that call on   them  to infer social meanings,
respond in ways that are socially appropriate, and accurately communicate their ideas to an audience. This seems
particularly important for students coming  from other cultures (NRP,      2000). As  a Jamaican  student new   to
Canada who participated in this study said:

    Sometimes when I'm at home with nothing to do ideas will be running through my head and I'll say
    I'm just going to put it on Knowledge Forum. Because sometimes when I'm at home I can get really
    bored so I just go on the forum. It has changed my writing because at the beginning of the year I knew
    for sure that I wasn't a good writer because my marks weren't good as Mr. Mr. K. explained and now
    I'm up there with the rest of the class getting 80's and so it's good.

                                                       
The hypothesis for this study was that students who engaged in online collaborative discourse would improve
their literacy skills  compared  to   a class  that did not  have  the   opportunity     for online   discussions.     A specific
focus on classroom processes and the teacher's role are highlighted.

METHOD

Participants
Thirty-eight   secondary   students   in  two Grade     9   literature  classes    in an     inner-city  multicultural    school
participated.  A one-year  literature course   with  students  who      were  generally   not  going    to university    was  the
domain. Students were randomly assigned to courses by school administration. Researchers arbitrarily assigned
one class access  to   Knowledge    Forum.    Mr.   K. taught  both  classes   on  alternate   days at   the  same  time  in  the
morning.

Materials     for  Assessment
The reading comprehension assessments used for this study were adapted from Campbell and Brokop's (2000)
Canadian  Adult   Reading    Assessment   because    they  had been     validated  with  students   across    Canada   using  the
Fry (1977)  and   Chall (1995)   readability   indices  (cited in  Campbell    &   Brokop,     2000).    Additionally,   passage
topics  had been  chosen   by a  wide   array  of adult students who     reflected diversity    in  terms    of race,  class and
gender. Finally, the focus of the tool is comprehension not word recognition-a lower level skill. The texts are
grouped  into  levels, with  each   level increasing    in difficulty-based    on  factors   such   as  number    of   questions,
length and readability. For this study, two 500 - word texts at a Grade 9 readability level were selected. Texts
were counterbalanced so that students did not read the same text in the fall and spring.

PROCEDURE
At the beginning and end of the year, researchers administered pre and post reading assessments to students in
both classrooms.   Researchers   and    the   teacher  introduced   the   software    to  students    in a    one-hour   session.
Throughout the year-long course, students went to a computer lab twice a week and most logged in from home.
Towards   the end  of  the  course,   researchers   interviewed    five randomly   selected    students    in the  experimental
classroom and the   teacher. Beyond      that, there   was  little communication      between     researchers   and  Mr.   K. or
between researchers and students.

  For the experimental class, students began with an empty database. The first task was to contribute his/her
autobiography to a View2, called "Personal Autobiography". The activity, designed                     to   be   non-threatening,
allowed students to familiarize themselves with the software while getting to know a little about one another's
background,    interests and so on. Initially, students  collaborated to     teach each   other  aspects   of html,  an  activity
that did not involve the teacher. Two out of three classes per week were carried out in the school's computer
laboratory where students and their teacher       used  the  software    alone  or in    pairs to  compose      and revise   their
writing and   to offer feedback  on   other's  work.   Occasionally,    students  and  sometimes      the  teacher  gathered  to
discuss  an idea  posted in  the database.    An  analysis  showed      that most  students    also logged    in   outside class
time. All writing  from  first draft  to final paper    was  public  in  the   database   as   were the    teacher  `s formative
assessments in the form of annotations. Mr. K. also encouraged students to annotate and build onto each other's
drafts.

  Mr.   K.'s   control class typically   worked   in   small groups;    and   thus  the   entire  class  could  not    review all
exchanges regularly. These face-to-face conversations were transitory, and unlike database communication which
preserves discourse,   allowing  students   to return   to their ideas   and  study   them   from   a  variety  of  perspectives
(Hewitt, 2004).

  Occasionally,    in  both  classes, there were    whole  class   discussions  on    the writing   topic,    reading  a text or
discussing what the teacher    called "dangerous ideas". These were ideas contributed by the teacher             or  students to
a literal snake basket. These included ideas such as morals are relative, religion is dangerous, or different
cultures can't coexist as well as quotations from writers. The curricular content for both secondary classes was
the same:   creative writing, research and research reports, and personal essays. As          the year   progressed,   there was
a noticeable shift in the experimental class as students began to assume some ownership for discourse in the
database. As one example, early in the year, students had written creation myths and their last assignment was

2 A View in a Knowledge forum database allows participants to organize their discourse according to problems
 or issues graphically. Notes, the basic way to contribute to a discussion, can be copied from one view to
 another.

                                                             
to write a science fiction story. Noticing that the first assignment was to write a creation myth from long ago
and a  science fiction story  to take place in the future, one  student   wondered   about the  concept    of time. He
created a view for discussion and the rest of the class joined. Their ideas were diverse: time is man made, time
is universal, or time is a cycle. A section of their discussion is shown in Figure 1 below.

    Figure 1: A Knowledge Forum View with Sections of a Note Thread.

RESULTS
As well as the Canadian Adult Reading Assessment, final grades for experimental and control groups were
examined. For the experimental group, Knowledge Forum's Analytic Toolkit was used to assess quantitative
activities (i.e., expressing ideas in writing, building onto other's ideas, reading) as was the teacher's database
activity. Towards    the end  of the academic  year, video   interviews   were conducted   with the   teacher  and  five
students in the experimental class.

Classroom       Culture
    Mr. K. reported that students in the experimental class had higher attendance and assignment completion
rates than students in the control group.  For example,    the first assignment saw   a completion    rate of 100%  for
the experimental  class  versus  a 30% completion rate   for   the control  class; and  according  to the  teacher  this
pattern continued. This result convinced Mr. K. that the database had a profound effect         (Klonsky, 2003). He
stated that he had never seen a group of students so supportive of each other:

    I wish you could see this from day to day because it is really impressive and so important. To me it is
    a revolutionary change. I just do not see the same thing going on in the other class. Now, once again,
    one might attribute it to the unique dynamic of that group but I don't think so. All of them are Grade
    nine students and these kids happened to have come into a situation where they really feel comfortable
    and they've been very successful and it's working.

    In the interviews    with five randomly    selected students,    four enjoyed  interactions in the     database and
believed  that their thinking,   writing and reading had   advanced    through feedback  from   others.    One student,
learning English as a second language and without Internet access from home, was not comfortable discussing
her ideas in the database. As one of the other four students summarized:

                                                         
     I would say it is a pretty interactive program that allows a person to develop their skills based on what
     other people might suggest and it is a pretty open system because you don't necessarily have to follow
     or to please anyone who annotates your work or builds onto your work.          You can choose exactly what
     you want to do and it builds on your independent level of study and thinking as well. Your analytic
     skills develop by using this program itself.

Both  the teacher and    four of the  five  interviewed  students  believed that   working   in the  database  developed
communication skills and literacy skills as well as more collaborative classroom culture. They also agreed that
formative assessments by the teacher and other students       provided more   opportunities  to improve    their writing.
A sample of students' discusions     shown  below    in Table 2 illustrates their online discourse:

Last modified: 2003, April 09 (09:26:36) by Lennie L.

My theory:3 Time   is only    what we   make of  it. It is something  in which   we   use as a  guideline  so the  whole
world can run smoothly. Now if no one if calculating time, does it still exist? My answer to this is no.

New information : This is because if you have two clocks both set exactly to the same time and then you bring
one into space and come back say a week later the time on the clock that went into space will be different than
the clock that was on earth.Because time never existed we only created      it, it is not universal.   Without   time  the
world maybe would not have advanced. Without recording days and hours that have gone by everything and
everyone would be out of sync. If time were to actually exist when would it exist? In the past, present, or future
even? In everyone's mind it appears that the past had existed but the only thing that really exists that you can
control is the present and the future. Now some people say that you do not have control over your future but I
believe you do. So if time does not really exist can we bend it? The answer to this in my head is yes. You can
only bend the near future. In your head you can make time go as fast or as slow as you desire. Now time is
only calculated as a mathematical equation so we can change this. Could we use the laws of mathematics to
reverse time or speed it up? Anything is possible.

I sometimes feel  the hands of   time closing in on me. When     I am  trapped  within its limits.  It almost  feels  like
an impenetrable barrier that is set on two speeds, slow and fast. You want to pass the barrier because you want
to desperately know what is beyond it but you know you can't. It is when we break this barrier, this barrier that
is time, that we will be able to go anywhere beyond this universe. So what is this barrier? Well if I knew I am
positive that I would't be spending my time (get the irony!) at VRA. Though, I do know that time is physics
and we have bound ourselves to these laws of physics because we are ignorant people and we want to live lives
that have meaning and in the end will wrap up into a perfect package as time passes by our gravestones.

So then if the gravity is higher , on a watch, the gravity will push the hands down? What does that have to do
with gravity then? If you have a clock that works on the sun, then where does gravity come into play? People
measure   time using  clocks  and  sundials, but taking    your clock  out into  space  isnt  the   reason you   will age
quicker or slower outside of earth. Time acts upon us whether or not we have clocks. Clocks don't mean we
created time.

John, in  response to your    comments   it has been    proven that clocks tick  at different  speeds  on  Earth   and in
Space. You see there is something called gravity which puts pressure on different objects forcing them to do
certain things. In space there is less pressure than on Earth because there is no gravity. Now with less pressure
on a clock in  space  it would   either move  faster  or slower.   Regardless which   one  the  point  is  it will move
FASTER OR SLOWER than the one on Earth.

You see this is how I came back to the idea we invented time. Because it is a worldly measurement and does
not prove to be the same outside the earth how can it really fully exist.

John you say "It is true that people age quicker on earth than in space, but that has nothing to do with clocks
and peoples' measure of time." I ask you then what is aging if it has nothing to do with our measurements of
time? Who is to say that our lives start when we are born? Maybe they start when we end. Time is a way to
bring stability to havoc. We need time to understand ourselves and what is happening around us.

I need to understand     To me I find it quite incomphrensible to believe that time actually repeats itself.       For
example,  if  looking at a solar  calendar, the 365  days  repats  itself but how   do  we   know   exactly that it is
repeating itself if time is only exsistant for a fraction of a second. To an even further extent I wonder if time
really exsists? We can not consider the futur time. The past is time that has already passed. The present is only
there for only a mere instance. the matter is quite large and is quite hard to answer with only my understanding.
To prove the complexity of this subject, the moment you finish reading this it will already be the past and that
moment in time has passed and will never exsist again.

Quantitative     Results:     The    Canadian     Adult    Reading      Assessment          (CARA)
Students in both classes were asked to read an expository text ("The Halifax Explosion" concerning events that
occurred during WWI. "Why Birds Fly" that focused on anatomical and physiological characteristics of birds
affording flight.). Texts were counterbalanced so that student who read about Halifax in the fall read about birds
in the spring. After students had read the text, it was removed and students were asked to (1) retell the story and
(2) to answer 10 questions that required a factual or an inferential response (e.g., "Who was to blame for the
Halifax explosion?" Answers were     not explicitly provided in the text.

Table 3: Mean Pretest and Post-test Question and Recall Scores for Experimental and Control Classes.

    A multivariate   analysis was conducted4. Pretest   scores for the  question  section of the  assessment  did  not
vary between groups. They were used as a covariate for the post-test scores. Post test scores revealed that the
experimental class performed significantly better than the control class F        (1,26)  =   34.44,  p <   .0001   for
answering questions. There    was also an   interaction between   group   and questions   F  (1,26) = 5.66  p  <  .04.
Pretest scores for the recall section of the assessment for the experimental and control groups did not differ and
were used as a covariate for the post-test recall scores which did differ F (1,26) = 77.84, p < .001. There was no
interaction between group and   recall F (1,26) = 2.76,  p >   .1. There  was an  interaction  between  questions  and
recall scores F  (1, 26) = 27.72, p  < .001.  There  was  no  group  by question  by  recall interaction. Clearly,  the
experimental group outperformed the control group on both measures. It is also not surprising that there was a
question by recall interaction since both were related to the text. The one noticeable difference was that there
was no group by recall interaction. There are two possible explanations: the first is that there was a ceiling effect
for the recall test; and the  second was that recall may  be   a measure  of  knowledge   telling where   the task  for
students was to use a copy delete strategy that might not be expected to differ between groups.

4 Thanks to   an anonymous    reviewer  who  suggested   this analysis. This  led the author   to include  only  those
  students who had competed the pretest, post-test   and for whom there   was a   final grade.

                                                         
Final    Grades
    Final grades   (not including  database  activities) for  the  two  classes were   examined.    They    revealed  a
significant difference between classes F (1,26) = 6.13, p < .03. Additionally, four students in the control class
did not achieve a grade of 50% and one student in the experimental class did not.

Table 5: Analytic Toolkit Resuts for the Students

Previous  research  (Lamon & Power, 1997)     showed   that reading  in the  database  was   correlated with    advance
placement   course  results but  writing was  not.  In the  present  study, both   writing, reading  and    number   of
revisions were significantly correlated with final grades as can be seen in Table 4. It is now possible to examine
the  number   of build-on notes and number   of  annotations: both   of which  are sensitive  to collaboration   in  the
database. However, in the database these students used, neither measure was available in the ATK; nor could
they  be calculated in a  conversion of  the database  to a later version. This was  a  limitation  in  understanding
effects of student collaboration on literacy development.

Teacher Analytic Toolkit Results

    As well as examining student results in terms of database activity, it was of interest to examine the teacher's
behaviour in the database. This revealed a pattern characteristic of teachers with some experience in using
Knowledge Forum but who are not experts in developing and sustaining knowledge building communities in
their classrooms  (Lamon,   2005). As   the results demonstrate,  Mr.   K  made  172  annotations   and     45 build-on
notes. He did not provide students with opportunities to create their own views since the teacher created 12 of
the 13 views.

     # Notes             % Notes            % Notes         # Notes in Build-        # Views            # Annotations

Table 7.  Analytic Toolkit Results for the Teacher

DISCUSSION
Results indicated that computer supported collaborative learning affected literacy development in terms of a task
that required  a knowledge  transforming  strategy  (answering  factual and inferential questions)  and     in terms of
tasks requiring  a  knowledge   telling strategy (recall of  texts). Experimental   students   outperformed     control
students  - an indication that students even  when   working  individually  are able to  work    critically with ideas.
Additionally, final grades correlated with database activity suggesting that students' individual work (number of
notes written, revisions) and collaborative work    (proportion of notes read) is  related to course outcomes. That
the Analytic Toolkit measures that could not determine effects of collaboration (number of annotations; number
of build-on notes) was a serious limitation. Unlike many educational interventions this effect isn't compromised
by teacher intervention, a criticism frequently directed at educational    reforms that  are, in  part, dependent    on
teacher differences. Participating teachers in reform efforts are early adopters of information and communications

                                                         
technology; but teachers in control classes may not be (see Doubler, Laferriere, Lamon, & Rose, 1993) for a
discussion on early adopters and ICT).

    When students     were given the   freedom   to express ideas, in their discussion   of time,  the  nature  of online
discourse changed from a task focus to idea centered. What the electronic database did allow was the emergence
of students' discourse as the primary medium for understanding what they were reading and writing.                 Mr. K.
read many notes in the database and his responses provided students with constructive feedback for improving
their writing. He  also asked for a   reconsideration  of ideas, and alluded    to other  literary sources. Finally,     the
database afforded     opportunities  for  three  of  NRP's  (2000)   recommendations      for  reading    comprehension:
comprehension monitoring, cooperative learning, and answering questions with feedback.

    Students of all ages construct scripts for school. Based on years of similar experiences, they develop scripts
that include listening to lectures, predicting what will be on texts, using copy delete strategies for summarizing
texts and memorizing facts. Although, Mr. K. released agency to students in terms of assessment literacy, he
did not overtly   encourage  students  to view   the knowledge   of  the collective   as the  focus.   If  the goal is   to
advance the knowledge of the group, students must first understand how their knowledge is limited and then
seek to improve it.   New contributions by one      person will influence   subsequent   investigations by  others    and
so  individual understanding     is driven  forward   by the dual  need  to  be  familiar  with the  knowledge     of    the
collective, and   the desire to  advance    that knowledge.     Implicitly, Mr.    K. may     have  realized this  in    his
comment:

    The idea that many heads are better than one that you may be the expert or may have learned more or
    have a better education but on a specific matter of work that does not mean that there isn't a sufficient
    amount   of knowledge    and    thought in that  classroom  that you can't  advance   further  than the teacher.
    My philosophy is that there is more out there in the classroom by way of resources than the teacher
    knows.

    Nonetheless,  the  fact that all students    were assigned  the  same   set of  tasks argued   against  a  knowledge
building philosophy. Even though students' took some control of the curriculum the teacher assigned most of
the content: that is, all students were required to do the same thing at the same time. Reconciling the inevitable
tension between mandated curricula and knowledge building community development ­ that is, the trade off
between depth and breadth was a challenge in this classroom.

    The teacher's many online contributions suggested that he may have been more involved in the discourse
than is common in classrooms led by expert knowledge building teachers (Lamon, 2005). Expert knowledge
building teachers organize their classrooms so that problems of understanding and knowledge advances in the
database are made public beyond      the database.   Beginning  knowledge   building   teachers intervene   very  little in
the database but when they do they are more directive in terms of the curriculum. At the intermediate stage on a
developmental trajectory in appropriating a knowledge building philosophy, teachers intervene frequently in the
database not   so much  to  direct  students but  to offer constructive  feedback.  A    goal  for further research is   to
examine the role of teachers' online discourse in blended learning environments; and how teachers' professional
development might foster teachers' adoption and appropriation of computer supported collaborative learning.
