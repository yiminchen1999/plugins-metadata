      Abstract.  This  paper    argues  that for  understanding    motivation  in collaborative  inquiry-based
      learning settings, there is an urgent need to develop new instruments that can capture the impact of
      the changes from the learning of well-defined content to open-ended inquiry and from individual
      learning to group-based learning on learning motivation. It reports on the development of such an
      instrument, the Collaborative Inquiry-based Project Questionnaire (CIPQ). Confirmatory factor
      analysis of the CIPQ data on six independent groups (n=269, 235, 173, 192, 300 and 254) of
      students  who   participated    computer-supported       collaborative learning    (CSCL)  projects  has
      consistently  yielded   a five-factor  model     of motivation  (Project Work,   Social Learning,   Task,
      Reinforcement and Social Pressure factors). The validity of CIPQ was indicated by the empirical
      relationship  found between     the   five factor   scores and  independent  measures   of the levels of
      project engagement of the students.

INTRODUCTION
Why do some students try harder than their classmates in learning? Why are some students more willing to
strive for difficulties and challenges? Why is it that some students rarely engage themselves in deep learning?
Motivation is a construct that refers to the inner psychological process that provides a behaviour its energy and
direction (Reeve, 1996). Studies of motivation that aim to answer these important questions have become an
important research area since 1970s. A number of well known theories about motivation have been developed,
such as self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), goal models (Ames, 1992; Pintrich, 2000), expectancy-
value theory (Eccles et al., 1983), self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986; 1997) and self-theories (Dweck, 1999). They
were theories about learning motivation in traditional settings in which learners engage in well-defined learning
tasks individually, following detailed instructions provided by teachers.
  In recent years, collaborative inquiry-based learning, often organized as project work in schools, has become
increasingly prominent as a response of schooling to the challenges of the 21st Century (Scardamalia, 2001;
Law, 2004). This new form of learning setting differs from traditional settings in several important ways: instead
of learning individually through short and specific subject-related tasks, students have to work with others in
teams and inquire into ill-structured questions over extended periods of time; learning outcomes depend not only
on individual efforts but even more on group collaboration; instead of learning with well-defined goals, learners
have to  cope  with  many   uncertainties    in  their inquiry   processes and  often  have  to  determine  their own
benchmarks  for assessment.     What    are the  impacts    of such  changes   on students'   motivation?  Would   the
motivation structure remain     the same?   If  not, how   is  motivation  structured in collaborative inquired-based
learning settings? How  should      the concept   of   motivation  be operationalized    and measured   in these  new
contexts? It is argued that the current motivational approaches and their instruments developed in traditional
learning settings are insufficient to capture the impact of inquiry and collaboration on learning motivation. There
is an urgent need to develop an instrument for measuring motivation in collaborative inquiry-based learning
contexts as the first step to develop an explanatory model on motivational structure in these new contexts. This
paper reports on the development of an instrument to address this need. More specifically, this study aims to
develop an instrument for revealing the latent motivational factors of students in the new learning settings and to
investigate their construct validity through triangulation with other indicators of students' engagement in the
collaborative learning tasks.

                                                            
THE     ONTOLOGICAL            STATUS         OF   MOTIVATION             IN  DIFFERENT          MOTIVATION
THEORIES
As mentioned, there has been a lot of exciting theoretical developments in studies of motivation such as the self-
determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), goal models (Ames, 1992; Pintrich, 2000), expectancy-value theory
(Eccles et al., 1983), self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986; 1997) and self-theories (Dweck, 1999) over the last two
decades. Underpinning    these different theories  are different  ontological     and structural assumptions   about
motivation, leading to differences in the stability of motivation as measured across situations as well as the
dimensional aspects captured in understanding motivation (Murphy & Alexander, 2000).
  Some theories conceptualize motivation as a personal trait which remains constant across situations. For
example, one of the major claims of self-theories is that motivation is very much dependent on whether the
learner believes that intelligence is malleable   (incremental)  or fixed  (entity)  (Dweck,  1999).  Learners  who
perceive intelligence as a changeable quality through learning would be more motivated than those who perceive
intelligence as a fixed innate quality. On the contrary, some other theoretical approaches, such as self-efficacy
and expectancy-value theory, conceptualize motivation as task-specific states which change from task to task
(Bandura, 1997; Eccles et al., 1983).  Self-efficacy is a motivational construct associated with a person's belief
in his/her self-competence in completing a specific task and a stronger belief in self-competence would result in
a higher motivation for that specific task (Bandura, 1997). In Wigfield & Eccles's (2000) expectancy-value
theory, the expectancy  construct  is similar  to Bandura's  self-efficacy    and the value construct  refers  to the
students' value judgment towards a task, including the perceived importance, intrinsic value and utility value of
the task and the effort they are willing to pay to accomplish the task.
  There is a third group of theories which conceptualize motivation as a construct between the above two
ontological extremes such that it is sensitive to the learning contexts and yet still carries some stability over time
and situations (Pintrich, 2000). The achievement goal construct of the goal models and the self-determination
theory are two examples. Achievement goal construct associates motivation with individuals' beliefs about the
learning activities concerned, such as task purposes, criteria for success and what constitutes effective learning
strategies to achieve the perceived successfulness (Pintrich, 2000). Self-determination theory conceptualizes
motivation  as a  two-dimensional   construct  comprising    the task   and   reinforcement  dimensions.    The   task
dimension accounts for people's intrinsic motivation to engage in a particular activity because of the positive
feelings inherent in doing the task itself (White, 1959; Woodworth, 1921). On the other hand, the reinforcement
dimension refers to extrinsic motivation associated with the external and environmental drives (Deci, 1972;
Lepper, Greene & Nisbett, 1973). While the self-determination theory builds upon the classic model of intrinsic
and extrinsic motivation, it also breaks away from the perspective of taking intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as
competing   dichotomous  constructs.  Instead, the  theory  proposes    a taxonomy    of external  motivations  with
different levels of internalization of task values and autonomy of behaviour, from the least motivated "external
regulation" to "introjection", "identification" to "integration" (Deci & Ryan, 1985). The theory also suggests
some mediating   factors  influencing  students'   levels of motivation    such   as  students'  perception of  self-
competence and the value that they place on the tasks (Deci & Ryan, 1985).
  The    differences in conceptualizations of  motivation    between    these approaches  are   also reflected in the
designs of the respective self-report instruments. Dweck and Henderson's questionnaire (1988) for measuring
respondents' belief on intelligence based on the self-theories paradigm is a context-free scale. The self-efficacy
scale for academic achievement (Bandura, 2001) and the instrument for assessing children's ability beliefs and
subject task values (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000) are context-specific instruments which always refer to specific
subject domains in their designs. On the other hand, both the scales for measuring goal orientation developed by
Niemivirta (1998) within the goal models paradigm and the Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ-A)
developed by Ryan and Connell (1989) within the self-determination theory paradigm frame their questionnaire
items within a general academic context such as studying for schoolwork or doing homework.

LEARNING          MOTIVATION             IN       COLLABORATIVE                INQUIRY-BASED                TASK
CONTEXTS
Despite the differences between their conceptualizations and instrument designs, all the discussed approaches
operationalize motivation among three important dimensions in traditional learning contexts, including the self,
task and reinforcement dimensions. Self-theories, self-efficacy and the expectancy construct in expectancy-value
theories all capture the self dimension by stressing the importance of the learners' beliefs on self-intelligence or
competence. The task dimension is integral to the goal models, self-determination theory and the value construct
in expectancy-value theories, and refers to the intrinsic motivation derived from engaging in a task or the
learner's perceived importance of the task. The reinforcement dimension is captured in the classic intrinsic-
extrinsic dichotomy and is also integral to the self-determination theory as extrinsic motivation.   However, when

                                                         
school   learning  settings change    to feature  prominently      collaborative inquiry-based  activities, does   the
importance of the self dimension in motivation remain the same? Do beliefs on self-competence still matter?
Would the perceived competence of groupmates influence the learner's attitude towards the learning tasks? Is
reinforcement  still an  important  dimension  in  learning   motivation   when  the outcome   pertains to  the group
instead of to the individual? Furthermore, when the learning task changes from being short, well-defined and
with definite solutions to being extended, ill-structured, full of uncertainties and without clear unique solutions,
what are the impacts of these changes on the task dimension of motivation? The existing instruments for the
measurement of motivation cannot capture the impact of open-ended inquiry and collaborative learning.
    There are a few published studies that investigated motivation in this kind of new learning contexts, for
example, the work of Järvelä and Niemivirta (2001) and Veermans and Järvelä (2004). However, even for these
studies, the research   instruments   adopted  were    still those developed   for studying  learning   motivation in
traditional classrooms. This further highlighted the need for a research instrument that can help us to understand
more adequately motivation in collaborative inquiry learning contexts. This paper reports on some initial work
done in the development of such an instrument.

INSTRUMENT DEVELOPMENT
The current project conceptualizes motivation as a construct that it is sensitive to the learning contexts and yet
still carries some stability over time and situations, which is similar to the perspective adopted in the self-
determination theory. More specifically, motivation is taken as the context-induced structural tendencies of the
individual  to a  learning  situation (Niemivirta, 2002;      Pintrich, 2000). This  conceptualization  assumes   that
students' motivation in collaborative inquiry-based learning settings to be a kind of chronic structure which
carries a general level of stability across situations, yet still sensitive and malleable according to contextual
factors and dimensions, such as the specific group dynamics or inquiry topics involved.
    In this study,   a self-report instrument, Collaborative    Inquiry-based    Project Questionnaire  (CIPQ),  was
developed in two language versions, English and Chinese. The questionnaire was designed to examine whether
there are additional structural components of motivation in addition to the task and reinforcement dimensions.
Its 24-item earliest version was modified to a 20-item version according to the participants' on-site responses as
well as the statistical analysis which verified the validity of the instrument (Chow, 2003). Eight of the 20 items
in CIPQ were adopted from the Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SRQ-A) (Ryan & Connell, 1989).

  SRQ-A is a self-report instrument developed within the self-determination theory paradigm that measures
students' motivation by soliciting the reasons for students' engagement in school settings. There are four sets of
questions in SRQ-A, including "1. Why do I do my homework?", "2. Why do I work on my class work?", "3.
Why do I try to answer hard questions in class?" and "4. Why do I try to do well in school?" Each question is
followed by eight similar items which list the possible reasons for their engagement in relation to the task and
reinforcement dimensions in the learning settings. For example, the eight items in Question 1 are "because I
want the teacher to think I'm a good student", "because I'll get in trouble if I don't", "because it's fun",
"because I will feel bad about myself if I don't do it", "because I want to understand the subject", "because
that's what I'm supposed to do", "because I enjoy doing my homework" and "because it's important to me to do
my homework". The 32 items in SRQ-A comprise four motivation sub-scales (external regulation, introjection,
identification and intrinsic motivation).  Each respondent's           score  on each sub-scale can  be calculated  by
averaging the item scores on the respective subscale, from very true (4) to not at all (1).
  Table 1 lists three question stems and the 20 response items in CIPQ. The first two question stems and the
associated eight response items are adopted from SRQ-A. To solicit responses specific to collaborative inquiry-
based learning contexts, a new question stem (why do I participate in project work?) and 12 response items
were developed, with four items on the inquiry aspect (Item 10, 11, 14 & 16) and the remaining eight items on
the social aspect (Item 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19 & 20) of the learning situations. Respondents are required to
select their responses on a 7-point likert-scale, from 1 (strongly disagree), 4(neutral) to 7(strongly agree).

RESEARCH SETTING
For the purpose of establishing the scale structure and validity of CIPQ, the instrument was administrated to
students who participated in the Learning Community Projects1 (LCP) organized by the Centre for Information
Technology in Education (CITE) at The University of Hong Kong. LCP is a set of design experiments on
computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) using Knowledge Forum®2 (KF). From July 2002 to May
2004, four rounds of collaborative inquiry-based projects were organized, including Peer Tutoring Project (PTP;
Jul-Oct, 02), Assessment for Better Learning Project (ABL; Jun-Sept,03), Promoting Higher-order Thinking
Through Knowledge Building Project (PTP; Oct-Dec, 03) and Go Up Stay High Project (GUSH; Mar-May, 04).
In each of these four rounds, there were about 200 to 300 grade 9 to 12 student participants, coming from
several secondary schools in Hong Kong. The students from the same class were organized to form groups
varying in size from four to six to work on a study topic for about six to eight weeks, with their teachers as the
facilitators. The topics of study for the projects were generally assigned by the teachers, in subject areas ranging
from the sciences to humanities.

LEARNING
Two   rounds   of the 24-item  CIPQ   (pre-PTP,  n=269;             post-PTP, n=235)  were administered  to the LCP
participants. Based on the item statistics, four item responses were removed to form a reduced 20-item version
of the CIPQ (Chow, 2003). Four rounds of this 20-item version was subsequently administered (post-ABL,
n=173; pre-PHT, n=192; post-PHT, n=300 and post-GUSH, n=254). Investigations of the motivational structure
began with an    exploratory factor analysis using SPSS             (SPSS, 1999) and  followed  by the construction of
confirmatory factor analytic models with LISREL (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 1993). Exploratory factor analysis is a
statistical procedure for exploring characteristic features among a set of variables for detecting their underlying
latent factors (Byrne, 1998). It is widely recognized as a useful method in the early stages of empirical data
analysis for examining uncertain links between variables and latent factors (Jöreskog & Sordom, 1993). With
the information gathered from exploratory factor analysis as prior information, sequential confirmatory factor
analysis was conducted. It involved more rigorous statistical techniques to construct measurement models for
confirming or disproving hypothesized underlying latent variable structures (Byrne, 1998). To further ensure the
robustness of the instrument, the models constructed for the two versions of CIPQ in the current study were each
validated with an independent set of data.
  A five-factor model was repeatedly founded according to the CIPQ responses collected from PTP, ABL,
PHT and GUSH. To determine the statistical adequacy, each model was evaluated by a set of goodness of fit
statistics: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) developed by Steiger (1990), non-normed fit
index (NNFI) developed by Bentler & Bonnett (1980) and comparative fix index (CFI) developed by Benlter
(1990). It is generally suggested that a model with RMSEA lower than 0.1 and both NNFI and CFI being larger
than 0.9 is taken as statistically well-accepted (Kelloway, 1998; Diamantopoulos & Siguaw, 2000).

    An examination of the goodness of fit statistics of the validated models in Table 2 reveals that the 20-items
version offers a better statistical fitness than the 24-items CIPQ (e.g., from RMSEA=0.091 to RMSEA=0.070,
0.076 and 0.078).

    Table 3 lists the   five latent  factors and the  associated  response  items  in   the final 20-items model.  By
examining the meanings of their respective items, the five factors were labelled as Project Work factor, Social
Learning factor, Task factor, Reinforcement factor and Social Pressure factor. The Cronbach's Alphas which
indicate the reliability among the items of the factors are also listed in Table 3. Indeed, controlling the length of
the scale while   maintaining     a reasonable  reliability are both critical  in scale  development.   According   to
Loewenthal (2001), a scale with less than 10 items with its reliability above 0.6 is considered as well-designed.
In this regard, the five scales of CIPQ, each comprising of four items, were found be reliable across the different
sets of data collected.

    As can be seen from Table 3, the adopted items from SRQ-A were all clearly clustered together under the
Task and  Reinforcement      factors. This   outcome  aligns with  the classic intrinsic-extrinsic  perspective which
identifies both task and reinforcement as important dimensions in learners' motivational structure. However, the
emergence of the other three factors shed light on changes in learners' motivation structure when learning takes

                                                            
place in collaborative inquiry-based settings. The Project Work factor was constituted by items pertaining to
positive values associated with the task nature of project work and could be understood as an extension of the
task dimension. The differentiation of the Task and Project Work factors indicates that students considered
project work as activities distinct from general school work, possibly reflecting their identification of the inquiry
nature of project work. On the other hand, the Social learning and Social Pressure factors indicate that the social
aspect of the new learning contexts has an impact on learning motivation as well.

CIPQ    MOTIVATIONAL                SCORES        &    PROJECT       ENGAGEMENT:                      EMPIRICAL
EXPLORATIONS
Caution on the validity of self-report instruments in assessing motivation has been raised by many researchers
(Brown, 1988; Boekaerts, 2001). The validity of the instruments lies with their applicability in understanding
and explaining learners' behavior in the learning process. In this study, the five motivational factor scores of
students were analyzed in relation to their observable learning behaviors in two ways: the quality and quantity of
their engagement in the computer-supported collaborative learning tasks in LCP.

CIPQ Factor Scores and the Quality of Engagement
PTP was a reward scheme3 in which students had to work in groups to complete an inquiry-based project over
the summer holiday. The winners of the nine awards (these include both group and individual awards) were
selected based on a list of criteria associating to various aspects of knowledge building (Scardamalia & Bereiter,
1999), including the social aspects (i.e., Best Peer Tutor, Most Supportive Collaborator), the quality of inquiry
work of students (i.e., Best Research Award, Most Innovative Award,       Most Reflective Journal Award) and
good uses of  KF   functions (i.e., Best Use of   KF  Functions to Support  Collaborative          Knowledge Building
Award, Best  Use   of Scaffold  to   Support Critical Thinking  Award,   Best Design   of          Views and Database
Structures in KF, Best Use of KF for Scholarly Communication Award). The award winners were therefore the
students who engaged in the projects with a higher quality of learning outcome than their counterparts.
   It was hypothesized that the learners' motivation was highly associated with the quality of their learning
outcome. Therefore, a t-test was done to check the differences on the five motivation scores between the PTP
award winners (n=64) and their counterparts (n=132). The analysis results found that both before and after the
project, the award winners scored significantly higher in the Project Work factor, Social Learning factor and
Task factor than their counterparts by 0.274 (p0.05) in the pre-project data and this difference was even larger
in the post-project data, which became 0.367 (p0.005). This suggested a positive connection between the
motivational scores for the Project Work, Social Learning and Task factors and the quality of students' project
engagement.

CIPQ Factor Scores and the frequency of engagement
Another indicator of the extent of a learner's engagement in the computer-supported collaborative learning task
is the frequency of online reading and writing activities. The Analytical Tool Kit (ATK) is a peripheral software
of KF designed to provide data for the monitoring of the online activities within the platform, for example, the
number of notes created and scaffold supports used by a participant (Burtis, 1998). The ATK information of the
PHT participants (n=300) was used for investigating the correlations between their CIPQ motivational scores
and their frequency of engagement on KF.

  Table   4 lists the correlations   between  the five motivational  scores and   the engagement          of the  PHT
participants as reflected by the four engagement indicators provided by ATK: the number of notes created, the
number of notes read, the number of references and scaffolds used in the notes created by each participant. The

Project Work   factor,  Social Learning factor  and    Task factor  were  all   found  to show   significant   positive
correlation with all of the four engagement indicators. This finding provides consistent triangulation with the
significant correlation found  between  the  Project   Work,   Social learning  and  Task    factors with  the   quality
indicators of project engagement reported earlier.

CONCLUSION
This paper argues that as learning in schools change from the traditional model of individual attainment of well-
specified learning goals to collaborative inquiry-based formats, motivational research should seek to develop
new motivational models and instruments which are more attuned to capture the newly introduced inquiry and
social aspects of  the  new learning contexts.  The    current study  has developed    an  instrument   that measures
motivation in collaborative inquiry-oriented learning contexts, which yielded five motivational factors, including
the Task and Reinforcement factors generally found in the established motivation instruments, as well as three
new factors, the Project Work, Social Learning and Social Pressure factors. The emergence of these new factors
reveals the new dimensions in learning motivation brought about by the changes in learning organization.
  Repeated administrations of CIPQ to independent student groups have yielded statistics that indicate strong
robustness  of the instrument.  The  validity  of  the five-factor  model  and   the  potential utility of   the  CIPQ
motivational scores were demonstrated by the empirical relationships found between these scores to both the
quality and frequency indicators of the learners' engagement in the LCP projects. Although CIPQ and its five
motivational  factor model  was  developed   along  with  the  data   collected from  different  computer-supported
projects, as the respective items of each factor did not necessarily refer to any computer-supported settings, the
researchers  would   understand CIPQ   as a    generic instrument   applicable  in  either   computer-using    or non-
computer-using collaborative inquiry-based situations.
  Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that CIPQ is quite a valid self-report instrument in
understanding  motivation   in  the new   learning  contexts.   The   researchers  see   its potential  in  generating
quantifiable information (i.e., the factor scores) for measuring the levels of respondents' motivation regarding
the five latent factors. Nevertheless, the reported study is only the beginning of a larger project. To further
investigate and validate what actually the five subscales are assessing, the next phase of the study will conduct
analysis on the factor scores in relation to the interaction and learning processes of the LCP participants, for
example, their self-regulated learning behaviour. In the long run, it is hoped that this instrument will be found   to
be useful for investigations aimed to further our understanding of learning motivation in CSCL contexts. For
example, how does an individual's motivation affect his/her behavior in groups? How would individuals with
different motivational score profiles interact with each other when they work in the same group? How does
motivation relate to the inquiry process of the learners, such as the depth of idea interaction, their self-regulated
behaviour and affective sharing patterns?
