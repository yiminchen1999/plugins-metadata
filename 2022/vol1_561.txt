         Abstract: This paper presents a study of teacher motivation related to the design of a
         professional development programme. Seventy-four schoolteachers in Spain participated.
         Results show that teachers are more motivated to use evidence-based teaching and learning
         strategies over teacher inquiry for professional development. Yet, teachers seem motivated by
         the collaborative aspects of teacher inquiry. These results provide insights for adapting
         professional development approaches following experiences with emergency remote teaching.

Emergency remote teaching took place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and led to increased teacher
exposure to technology, experience with sharing resources among peers, and recognition of a need to improve
pedagogical usage of technologies (Beardsley et al., 2021). Hence, a European project (Illumine) was initiated to
build upon teacher experiences from emergency remote teaching and contribute toward a sustainable and teacher-
driven professional development (PD) approach for advancing pedagogical usage of technologies. The Illumine
PD approach is a convergence of learning design, teacher inquiry, and Japanese Lesson Study. Learning design
supports teachers in becoming designers of learning, able to take design decisions grounded on evidence and to
share their designs among communities of practice (Laurillard, 2012). Teacher inquiry is a process of searching
for tacit and practical knowledge and solutions to local problems of practice by applying a progressive problem-
solving procedure based on evidence (Ermeling, 2010). Teacher inquiry is based on teachers adopting a teacher
researcher mindset (Gray & Campbell-Evans, 2002). Lesson study is a PD approach that has been used for over
a century in Japan. It is led by teachers (bottom-up), relies on teacher inquiry and collaborative learning design,
and addresses specific problems teachers are facing (Fujii, 2019). However, lesson study has been difficult to
sustain outside of Japan due to teachers’ lack of time, research knowledge, and bias toward immediate results over
gradual improvements (Lim-Ratnam et al., 2019). This paper presents a survey research study that investigates
teacher motivation related to aspects of a lesson-study inspired PD approach. These topics include the use of
evidence-based teaching strategies, technologies for teaching and learning, and teacher inquiry for professional
development. The aim of the study is to inform the programme’s design, development, and messaging; and to act
as a baseline for a pre-post evaluation of the programme.
          Seventy-four teachers in Spain responded to the survey (female = 75.7%). Respondents were teachers at
various school levels: 16.2% in post-secondary schools (>18 yo), 31.1% in upper secondary (16-18 yo), 47.3% in
lower secondary schools (12-16 years old), and 29.7% in primary education (6-12 yo). Teaching experience also
varied among respondents: 10 or more years (78.4%), between 6 and 10 years (13.5%), and 5 or fewer years
(11%), In comparing teacher level of motivation across the three topics (see Figure 1), respondents marked having
higher motivation to use evidence-based teaching and learning strategies (strategies that research studies show
have more impact than others) (M = 5.82, SD = 1.01) over using digital technologies while planning and realizing
the lessons with students (M = 5.51, SD = 1.11), and using teacher inquiry for their PD (M = 5.38, SD = 1.06).

         In examining aspects of teacher inquiry (see Figure 2), respondents showed higher levels of motivation
for sharing advice with colleagues (M = 4.07, SD = .9), planning their own PD activities (M = 4.01, SD = .84),

and exchanging ideas, materials, and good practices with colleagues (M = 3.99, SD = .93) over using digital
technologies to reflect on and improve their practices (M = 3.46, SD = .91), and documenting ideas and reflections
about one’s lessons and teaching (M = 3.84, SD = .94).

A thematic analysis of answers to the open question, “Explain what motivates you to use (or not to use) a teacher
as a researcher approach for your professional development” found the most frequently mentioned hindrance to
be lack of time (f=14). No other hindrances appeared in more than two responses. Reasons to use the approach
provided by teachers were to facilitate their continuous learning (f=10), improve student learning (f=9), better
understand the contexts of present-day students (f=5), support reflective teaching (f=5), improve teaching efficacy
(f=5), help advance the teaching profession (f=4), and increase student motivation (f=3). Altogether, results
indicate that a teacher PD programme such as Illumine, that aims to foster teacher-researcher mindsets while
improving pedagogical usage of technologies, should consider emphasizing teacher learning of evidence-based
teaching and learning strategies over learning teacher inquiry for PD. To further appeal to factors motivating
teachers, the design of the programme can exploit the collaborative nature of teacher inquiry (in terms of helping
other teachers), make apparent ways in which the programme can improve teaching quality, and explicitly devise
strategies to scaffold the inquiry process, streamline documentation work, and aid teachers with time management
(i.e., managing the demands of the programme on top of their regular teaching work).
