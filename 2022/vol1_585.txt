         Abstract: In this study, a pre-test and post-test research design was employed to explore the
         role of online peer feedback features in uptake of peer feedback in the context of argumentative
         essay writing. To do this, 101 students were asked to individually write an argumentative essay,
         get involved in online peer feedback activity, and revise the original essay based on received
         peer feedback. The findings showed that online peer feedback features mainly justification of
         the problem in feedback can predict uptake of peer feedback in argumentative essay writing.

1. Introduction
         In higher education, online peer feedback is a popular instructional strategy as its effectiveness in
improving learning has been confirmed particularly in the context of argumentative essay writing (Latifi et al.,
2019; Noroozi et al., 2022). However, some studies have shown that online peer feedback does not always lead
to the desired learning outcomes (Li et al., 2019; van Popta et al., 2017). This is usually due to the nature and
quality of peer feedback whether it is solely affective feedback or it contains cognitive and constructive features
feedback (Nelson & Schunn, 2009). Prior studies confirm that peer feedback uptake can be affected by the nature
and quality of feedback (Nelson & Schunn, 2009; Patchan et al., 2016), however, it is not known to what extent
online peer feedback features can predict peer feedback uptake in the context of argumentative essay writing.
Therefore, this study was conducted to further explore this by answering the following research question.
         To what extent do online peer feedback features can predict uptake of peer feedback in the context of
         argumentative essay writing?
1. Method
2.1 Study design
         This exploratory study is a part of a bigger project that was carried out at Wageningen University and
Research center during the 2020-2021 academic year. An undergraduate course in the field of environmental
science was selected for this study, and a module called “Argumentative Essay Writing” was developed and
integrated into the course at the Brightspace platform. The module was followed by students for three weeks, and
each week they were asked to complete a specific task. In the first week, students were asked to write an
argumentative essay on one of the three provided controversial topics presented. In the second week, students
were asked to give feedback on the argumentative essays of two of their peers based on specific given criteria. In
the third week, students were asked to revise their original argumentative essay based on the two received
feedback sets provided by their peers.
2.2 Participants
         In this study, 135 undergraduate students participated, however, only 101 students have completed the
module. Almost 69% of the participants were female (N = 70) and only 31% of the participants were male (N =
31). For ethical reasons, participants were informed about the research setting of the course. This study also has
received ethical approval from the Social Sciences Ethics Committee at Wageningen University and Research.
2.3 Measurements
        To measure the quality of students’ argumentative essay performance, a coding scheme adjusted based
on Noroozi et al. (2016) instrument was used. To measure the quality of students’ online peer feedback, authors
developed a coding scheme based on literature reviews (e.g., Nelson & Schunn, 2009; Patchan et al., 2016).
2.4 Analysis
         A multiple linear regression test was used to answer the research question.
3. Results
        The results showed that the features of online peer feedback can predict uptake of peer feedback in
argumentative essay writing (F(5, 93) = 4.87, p < 0.01, R2=0.20). The coefficient of determination (R2) indicated
that 20% uptake in argumentative essay writing is influenced by peer feedback features. In addition, the results

showed that the justification feature of feedback is a significant predictor of peer feedback uptake in argumentative
essay writing (Table 1).

4. Conclusion
          The results have led us to realize that the nature of peer feedback, in particular, the justification feature
can predict peer feedback uptake in argumentative essay writing. This indicates that when the provided feedback
is justified and supported by various arguments, evidence and examples, the peers can better understand the
purpose of the feedback and then use it in their work (Strijbos et al., 2010). Another reason for the significant role
of justification is probably due to the strong role of problem justification in feedback, which may clarify why this
particular task needs improvement. In conclusion, this study showed that the nature of peer feedback plays an
important role in student success in writing an argumentative essay.
