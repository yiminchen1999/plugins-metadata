       Abstract: To solve complex real-world problems in life science, it is important for students to adopt
       a systems approach. This study examined a 2-week unit that used computer-based causal loop
       diagramming to foster university students’ systems thinking about obesity. Analysis of the causal
       loop diagrams revealed a significant shift toward a systems approach and showed that it was
       supported by a construct-revise-use process. The findings suggest the potential of causal loop
       diagramming to foster systems thinking.

Introduction
As issues grow and increase in complexity, the need to approach them via a systems perspective (Checkland,
2000) arises. A systems perspective entails understanding the whole of a system and the many levels of
interrelationships characterizing its parts. Socioscientific issues (SSI) are complex, ill-structured, and
controversial social issues with conceptual and/or procedural links to science that often involve contested
knowledge and are open to multiple solutions. Systems thinking in an SSI context entails a consideration of and
beyond the associated scientific elements, and the interactions within and between domains (Ke et al., 2020). We
are interested in supporting students in systems thinking through a computer-based causal loop diagramming tool.
Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are commonly used by systems thinkers for visualizing both the generic and the
specific and conceptualizing causal relationships and feedback loops. CLDs externalize users’ mental
representation of a complex system and are a reliable tool for developing and gauging students’ systems thinking.
When working as a team, the diagram serves as an artifact around which the team can discuss and develop ideas,
from which the diagram can be modified collaboratively. These operative-cognitive iterations support the systems
thinking of an individual or group (Knight & Littleton, 2015). This study investigated whether university students’
systems thinking about an SSI can be promoted through the use of computer-based causal loop diagramming and
explored the scaffolding strategies associated with developing systems thinking through causal loop diagramming.
Method
We examined student learning during a 2-week obesity unit forming part of a general education course. The
students worked in groups of three to four and were asked to create CLDs explaining the obesity phenomenon
before, during, and after the unit using the Vensim causal loop diagramming software package
(https://vensim.com/vensim-causal-loop-diagramming/). The pre-, mid-, and post-unit diagrams (see example in
Figure 1) were used to evaluate the students’ progressive development of systems thinking about obesity. The
students were also asked to submit individual weekly reflections on their learning experiences to deepen our
understanding of their shifts and evaluate how they personally felt about their learning experience. A repeated
measure MANOVA followed by LSD post-hoc test was used to compare the possible statistical significance of
shifts in the students’ systems thinking about obesity between the pre-unit, mid-unit, and post-unit evaluations.
The inter-coder agreement, as measured by Cohen’s kappa coefficient, ranged from 0.71 to 0.995.

Major findings and discussion
This study demonstrates students’ development of systems thinking about obesity through causal loop
diagramming, as evidenced in the significant increase in the quantities of components at the population level,
individual level, relationships described, B-loops and R-loops (see Table 1). The qualitative findings from the
reflective memos further reveal that the shift to a systems approach through causal loop diagramming was
supported by scaffolds in relation to constructing, revising, and using causal diagrams.
          Construct Collaborative learning through constructing CLDs in groups was found to increase the
number of variables and interactions identified in the system. This finding is consistent with that of Knight and
Littleton (2015) on the affordance of digital tools in supporting individual thinking and “interthinking.”
          Revise Multiple opportunities to revise CLDs were found to support the development of systems
thinking. Cognitively, more variables and interactions between variables were elicited with the input of new
information. Operationally, some of the students became aware of the flaws in their diagrams, such as unclosed
loops, and learned through the amendments they made.

         Use The process of proposing actions and incorporating them into their CLDs gave students the
opportunity to predict the consequences of an action and assess its effectiveness. Our empirical findings support
that proposing actions in response to obesity (thinking) led to the incorporation of these actions into the CLD
(operation); in turn, the incorporation of actions into the CLD facilitated their assessment and prediction of
outcomes (further thinking).
Conclusion
The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of causal loop diagramming to foster systems thinking about
obesity through the construction, revision, and use of CLDs that serve as epistemic tools for students to make
sense of, explain, and predict the obesity phenomenon. During this process, operations and thinking take place.
Although the use of systems thinking is reflected in operations, it is fostered at both the operational and cognitive
levels and in their two-way relationship.
