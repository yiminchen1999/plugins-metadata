         Abstract:     Assigning  roles  to   individual  students   can   influence  the  group's  knowledge
         construction (KC) process during online discussions. Twenty-one students were divided into
         two groups and assigned rotating roles for eight one-week asynchronous online discussions.
         The KC contributions of all 252 posts in the discussion were coded using a five phase scheme;
         then statistical discourse analysis was applied to identify segments of discussion characterized
         by particular aspects of KC and "pivotal posts"--those posts which initiated new segments of
         discussion.   Finally, the  influences of   assigned  student   roles on  pivotal posts and   KC  were
         modeled. The results indicate that most online discussions had a single pivotal post separating
         the discussion into two distinct segments: the first dominated by a lower KC phase; the second
         dominated by a higher KC phase. The pivotal posts that initiated later segments were often
         contributed mid-discussion by students playing one of two summarizing roles (Synthesizer
         and Wrapper).

Introduction
Small  group   interactions in  discussion  forums    are increasingly   common    during  online   learning  and blended
(face-to-face plus online) instruction. These discussions provide opportunities for negotiating meaning and co-
constructing knowledge (Boulos & Wheeler, 2007). Like their face-to-face counterparts, online discussions can
help learners participate in different aspects of the knowledge construction (KC) process: they can articulate
their ideas and hear alternative points of view; debate and probe different ideas more deeply; synthesize and
negotiate compromises      in  their positions;  and  test,  modify  and   apply   their newly-constructed    knowledge
(Stacey,  1999). However,     simply   putting  students  together  in   a computer-supported    environment    does   not
necessarily lead to knowledge construction (Fischer et al., 2002). Online conversations often remain exercises in
listing ideas rather than engaging in rich interactions to construct shared understandings (Thomas, 2002). To
support KC, online discussion environments must structure interactions to encourage productive collaboration
(Dillenbourg, 2002).
         We    investigate   one  technique    for  supporting    productive    collaboration  and    KC  during   online
discussions: assigning conversational roles (e.g., "Questioner") to script the process by which students interact
(Hare,  1994).  Specifically   we  use  both  content  analysis   and  statistical discourse  analysis  (Chiu,  2008)   to
examine   how:   (a)  the  process   of  KC   proceeds    in  an  online   discussion with    assigned roles;  and  (b) a
"summarizing" role in the middle of a discussion affects subsequent KC.
The Process of Knowledge Construction (KC)
The five-phase   Interaction  Analysis   Model   for  Examining    Social  Construction    of Knowledge    developed    by
Gunawardena et al. (1997) is a tool for conceptualizing and assessing the process of KC during asynchronous
discussions. The theoretical model was developed using a grounded theory approach and attempts to represent
"the complete process of negotiation" involved in KC (p. 413). The model is presented in enough detail to guide
empirical coding of the KC process and has been used extensively in studies involving roles.
         In Gunawardena et al.'s (1997) model, KC occurs in a series of successive (though not necessarily
strictly sequential) phases that can be viewed as moving generally from lower to higher mental functions. In the
model,  learners begin    by  sharing,  clarifying,  and  elaborating  ideas   (Phase  1:  Sharing  Information).   Then,
conflicts among them are explored (Phase 2: Exploring Dissonance). Next, learners reconcile conflicting ideas
by negotiating their meanings and co-constructing new knowledge propositions (Phase 3: Negotiating Meaning).
Learners may then test and revise their synthesized ideas (Phase 4: Testing and Modifying). Finally, they can
state and apply their new knowledge (Phase 5: Agreeing and Applying). The drive is to achieve higher phases of
KC;    however,  successive   phases    build on   each   other.  Hence,   all phases    contribute to  the   KC  process
(Gunawardena et al., 1997).
         While Gunawardena et al.'s (1997) model conceptualizes knowledge construction as a process which
occurs  though  learners'   interactions (via  their  posts), previous   work   has  not  capitalized  on its capacity  to
examine   this process  by  analyzing   patterns   of KC.    Past studies  have often  evaluated  discussion   quality  by
counting the posts in each KC phase (e.g., Schellens et al., 2007) or by computing each discussion's average KC
phase (e.g., Schellens et al., 2005). These compiled measures treat KC as an outcome variable where more posts
in higher KC phases indicate better learning, though the scheme was designed as a model of the process of
constructing knowledge. Importantly, two discussions can proceed quite differently, while having the same KC
phase counts (e.g., a sequence of posts with KC phases 1212312123 vs. 1111222233). By treating KC as an

aggregate outcome of individual contributions, prior studies failed to test a central underlying premise of the
model: groups construct knowledge through a specific sequence of phases. In this study we address this issue by
analyzing how the group proceeds through the phases of the KC process.
Possible Patterns of KC Phases
Gunawardena et al.'s (1997) model suggests two possible KC patterns, but others are also theoretically possible.
By identifying   these  patterns' characteristics, we  can empirically  test  for them. These   patterns  are currently
descriptive; future work will evaluate their benefits, drawbacks and relationship to KC outcomes.
Theoretically Predicted Pattern 1a: Strictly Progressive Segments for Each KC Phase
One interpretation of Gunawardena et al. (1997) views the KC phases as a strictly increasing sequence. Viewing
KC as an interdependent process and a cumulative group effort, an individual's progress through the phases
depends on and influences other group members, stimulating them to proceed through the phases more-or-less
together. Transitions between the phases can thus be viewed as initiated by a "pivotal post," a contribution by a
student (or the instructor) which changes the mode of discussion from one phase to another. This perspective
aligns with other recent work on "pivotal moments" in the CSCL community (e.g. Lund et al., 2009).
          A discussion that follows a strictly progressive sequence of the KC phases might proceed as follows.
Initially, learners share ideas (a series of KC Phase 1 posts, e.g., 111). When a learner disagrees with another
group member's idea (KC Phase 2), others may not always engage. Instead, they might continue proposing new
ideas  (e.g. KC  phases    111211).  In this case, the  discussion  continues  in a sharing   mode,  identified by  the
dominance of posts in KC Phase 1 (with occasional posts in other phases). In contrast, a disagreement can act as
a  pivotal post  that  radically  changes the   mode   of discussion.  In this  case   because  the  pivotal  post is a
disagreement,   the   new  mode   of discussion   becomes  that of  exploring  disagreements   (e.g.  11211222,     the
pivotal post is indicated in bold). At some point, a learner may attempt to reconcile views presented in different
posts (KC Phase 3). This can provide a more cohesive view of disparate ideas--a common base around which
group members can negotiate shared understandings. If others follow suit, the post serves as another pivotal
post, and the group transitions from debating to reconciling ideas (e.g., 22233233). Next, a learner may start
to test the negotiated idea(s) (KC Phase 4) which can stimulate more testing and revision of the idea(s), creating
another higher phase discussion segment (e.g., 332334454344). Finally, if a learner formalizes and applies the
revised idea(s), this can spark other applications in a KC Phase 5 discussion segment (e.g., 445434455545).
This   hypothetical   discussion follows  Gunawardena     et al.'s model  of  a "complete"    knowledge    construction
process; it consists of five distinct, segments of progressively increasing KC phases with changes initiated by
four pivotal posts (11211222332334454344 55545).
Theoretically Predicted Pattern 1b: Progressive and Regressive Segments for each KC
Phase
Knowledge construction is not always a strictly linear process (Paavola et al., 2004). Thus another interpretation
of Gunawardena      et al. (1997)   recognizes earlier  phases  as  logically prior to  later phases, but  also allows
regressive   segments:  segments    dominated  by  lower  KC    phases than   the previous segment.   For   example,  a
tentatively shared synthesis (KC Phase 3) might break down when a learner returns to debating the merits of a
particular idea (KC Phase 2) and others follow suit (e.g., 11211222 332332212). In this pattern, any
number of segments can occur, and the return to a "lower" phase as part of the KC process is not necessarily
negative for the discussion.
Alternative Patterns
There are other theoretical alternatives to the ones Gunawardena et al. (1997) suggest. One possibility is that
groups might skip one or more KC phases. For example, learners might share their ideas (e.g., 111211) and then
propose a compromise among them (1112113333) without exploring differences or disagreements (skipping
KC Phase 2). Then, they might conclude their discussion without testing or applying it (Phases 4 and 5). Here,
the discussion has only two segments (1112113333), though each segment is dominated primarily by posts in
one KC phase. This pattern of segments with skipped KC phases can be strictly progressive (Pattern 2a) or
include regressive segments (Pattern 2b; e.g. 111211333322122). In both cases the patterns do not require
passing through all earlier phases to reach later ones. Other alternatives are that the KC phases of posts increases
through progressive segments that are not clearly defined by a single phase (Pattern 3: e.g. 111221312132) or
that no distinct segments of KC phases exists (Pattern 4: e.g. 15314215). Next, we discuss how assigned student
roles and the functions they ask learners to perform align with the KC phases and might influence the above KC
patterns.
Supporting KC in Online Discussions with Assigned Student Roles
Online learning conversations often do not realize their potential as sites of rich KC. One way to increase the
likelihood   of valuable   learning  interactions  is by  assigning roles to   students to script   their collaboration
(Dillenbourg & Hong, 2008). Roles give students guidance about how to interact with one another productively

© ISLS                                                                                                                65
CSCL 2011 Proceedings                                                                                       Volume I: Long Papers

in ways   that promote    desired  cognitive,  metacognitive     and   socio-cognitive    processes  (King   2007).  Common
assigned   roles include    moderator,    starter, wrapper,    planner,     theoretician, source    searcher,  responder   and
summarizer (e.g., Schellens et al., 2005; Strijbos et al., 2004).
          Roles  can  support    collaborative KC    in online   discussions    by creating    positive  interdependence   and
mutual    accountability  among    students  (Schellens    et  al., 2007;   Strijbos et   al., 2004),    leading to  increased
interaction (Hara et al., 2000; Seo, 2007) and integration of discourse (Persell, 2004). Roles can also support
students' metacognitive awareness of their contributions to the group's KC (Persell, 2004; Strijbos et al., 2004),
helping   them   to   self-moderate    discussions    and   increase     their  autonomy,      ownership,     motivation   and
responsibility for learning (Seo, 2007). However, not all roles influence posts' KC, and specific assigned roles
can have different influences (for example, contrast the positive effects of the "Wrapper" role with the negative
effects of the "Source Searcher" role in De Wever et al., 2007 and Schellens et al., 2005; 2007).
          While past research suggests that some particular roles can have a positive impact on KC during online
discussions, research gaps remain. In particular, researchers have not examined the interdependent nature of the
group processes underlying KC, in which each learner's posts help build the context for others' future posts.
Specifically,  work   is  needed   to investigate  how     role-based   posts  influence  other   participant's  postings  and
overall group KC patterns. To consider how specific roles may interact with the KC process, we can examine
the alignment between the KC phases and the specific functions that each role asks a learner to enact. If a role
asks a learner to perform a function that aligns with a KC phase different from the KC phase of the group
members' current posts, that contribution could act as a pivotal post that initiates discussion in a new KC phase.
Building on De Wever et al.'s (2007) efforts to assess role enactment, Wise et al., 2009) analyzed assigned roles
in the literature and identified six core conversational functions that they ask learners to perform: Introduce New
Idea, Bring in Source, Use Theory, Respond, Give Direction, and Summarize. We propose that some of these
functions conceptually align with specific KC phases. Specifically, we focus our attention on the Summarize
function and its associated roles because it theoretically aligns with advanced phases of knowledge construction
(De Wever et al., 2007; Schellens et al., 2005; 2007).
Learners in Summarizing Roles May Create Pivotal Posts That Advance KC
Summarize is a synthetic function that asks a learner to organize and integrate different ideas in the discussion
(Wise et al., 2009). For example, in a discussion on math lesson planning, a learner can describe how several
different  suggested   activities  for teaching    parallel   lines could    be  combined.      Cognitively    this helps  the
summarizing learner (and potentially those who read the post) to consolidate their understanding of different
ideas. From a socio-cognitive perspective, summarizing posts can support the group in building on the existing
discussion, maintaining joint attention and coordinating their activity.
          With   respect   to  the KC   process,   a summarizing        post  can  identify    areas of   agreement    and aid
compromises    between     contested  ideas (which    aligns   theoretically   with  KC   Phase   3,   Negotiation  of Shared
Meaning). Or, it can help group members reach a final agreement and recognize changes in their ideas (which
aligns  with   KC   Phase   5,  Statement/  Application).     While    empirical   studies  show     that summarizing    posts
consistently   contribute  at  a high  KC   phase   (De    Wever    et al., 2007;  Schellens   et   al., 2005; 2007),  groups
assigned roles with a summarizing function have not consistently outperformed those without one (e.g., compare
Schellens et al., 2005 and 2007). One reason other group members may not realize the benefits of summarizing
posts  is that the  Summarize      function is often  assigned      to a Wrapper    role  asked   to conclude    a  discussion.
(Schellens et al., 2005; 2007; see also Hara, et al., 2000). Since a Wrapper generally summarizes at the end of a
discussion,  other  group   members    are  unlikely    to make     subsequent   posts and     thus  realize the coordination
benefits described above.
          We   propose    using  the  Summarize    function   in the   middle   of a discussion     to   synthesize discussion
strands, maintain joint attention and ground subsequent discussion. While few students are likely to post after
the Wrapper at the end of a discussion, many more are likely to build on a midway summary that helps them
integrate their understanding of the various ideas. Reading a summarizing post can prompt them to join the
synthetic effort to co-construct shared understandings with their groupmates. As more students do this, they
create more posts in higher KC phases, compounding these processes until the whole group collectively climbs
to a higher phase of KC. In this way, a midway summarizing post is potentially a pivotal post that can elevate a
group to a higher KC phase, helping to solve the insidious problem of online discussions stuck in the rut of
simply listing ideas without developing them collaboratively (Thomas, 2002).

Research Questions
Past work has looked at KC in aggregate, losing important information about patterns of KC and how they may
be influenced    by   the assignment   of student   roles.  In addition,    the beneficial  Summarize      function  has  been
primarily assigned to roles that post summaries at the end of discussions, limiting its potential to elevate group
KC processes. In this study, we used a temporal analysis to examine KC as a process in a series of role-based
discussions. One particular role ("Synthesizer") was used to elicit a Summary midway through each discussion.

We asked the following questions:

1.  What pattern(s) characterize KC processes during an online, asynchronous discussion with assigned roles?
2.  Does a summary midway through the discussion affect subsequent KC?

Methods
Participants
Twenty-one students (8 women, 13 men) taking a blended (face-to-face and online) Educational Technology
course. Seven of the 21 participants were of Asian descent. There were 10 undergraduate students, 8 graduate
students, and 3 practicing teachers. Class members formed two discussion groups: (a) undergraduates and (b)
graduate students and teachers.
Learning Context & Procedure
For each  of the  eight  weeks    of online  asynchronous  discussion,  groups were asked    to collectively create a
solution to an authentic instructional design challenge (e.g. in one week they were asked to design a set of
activities to help 10 year-olds become "experts" in the Chinese Zodiac). Each week, students were given one of
10 functionally-aligned roles to play: Starter (New Idea, Give Direction), Inventor (New Idea), Importer (New
Idea, Bring in Source), Mini-me (Use Theory), Elaborator (Respond), Questioner (Respond), Devil's Advocate
(Respond),   Traffic     Director    (Given  Direction),  Synthesizer   (Summarize,  Give       Direction),  Wrapper
(Summarize). These were randomly assigned and rotated so that each student played a different role in each of
the eight weeks. Roles were introduced to students via a role description guide and modeled by the instructor in
an earlier practice discussion. Students were required to post twice (first five weeks) or once (final three weeks)
each week in the LMS Moodle discussion tool (http://moodle.org/); discussion participation was 15% of the
course grade. A total of 252 posts were created and collected for content analysis.
Content Analysis
Function enactment and KC were evaluated at the level of the individual post by two independent coders for all
posts in the data set. Krippendorff's  (Krippendorff, 2004) was used to assess inter-rater reliability.
Enactment of Functions
The Analysis Scheme Identifying Message Characteristics-Functional (Wise et al., 2010) has six dimensions
corresponding to the six conversational functions. Krippendorff's  was: New Idea (.65), Bring in Source (.92),
Use Theory (.73), Respond (.98), Give Direction (.76), and Summarize (.88). New Idea was coded as Absent or
Present; other dimensions were coded as Absent, Minorly Present, or Extensively Present.
Knowledge Construction (KC)
Gunawardena et al.'s (1997) scheme was used to code the highest KC phase achieved in each post (= .84).
Statistical Analysis
The KC in each group's weekly online discussions was modeled at the micro- and meso-levels using Statistical
Discourse Analysis (SDA) (Chiu, 2008). As described below, SDA first statistically determined pivotal posts
("breakpoints" in statistical terminology) and discussion segments based on the KC phase exhibited in posts,
then tested explanatory models for these pivotal posts, and finally tested explanatory models for the KC phase of
an individual post. Several levels of variables were used in the explanatory models to capture the characteristics
of student demographics, learning activities, roles and posts. The statistical power of any regression (including
SDA) for this sample size of 252 posts is .99 for an effect size of .30 ( = .05; Cohen et al., 2003).
         In the initial phase of analysis, for each week of each group, we statistically identified pivotal posts that
divided  discussions   into segments    by  using regression   analysis to model   different possible numbers     and
locations of pivotal posts and finding the model that best fit the data (Chiu & Khoo, 2005). First, we modeled
the KC phase of each post in a discussion under the assumption of no pivotal posts. Next, we assumed one
pivotal post and tested all possible locations of the pivotal post. Then, we assumed two pivotal posts and tested
all possible pairs of locations of two pivotal posts, and so on up to all possible location combinations for six
pivotal posts. The best model of pivotal posts had the smallest Bayesian information criterion (BIC, also known
as Schwarz information criteria, Kennedy, 2004).
         In the second phase of analysis we created an explanatory model (a multilevel, binary logit regression)
to identify characteristics associated with pivotal posts and the posts preceding them. We entered variables at
multiple levels   (e.g., activities, student characteristics, and post  characteristics) in  sets according   to time
constraints, expected causal relationships, and likely association with pivotal posts. If the variable Summarize
was  significant, we     tested whether  the effects differed  across  the type of summarizing     by replacing   the
Summarize variable with Minor Summary and Extensive Summary. We then used lag variables to model the

characteristics of the preceding posts. We first entered a set of post characteristics for the previous post (lag 1),
then added the same explanatory variables for the post before that (lag 2). No variables were significant at lags
greater than 2. To test for moderation effects by discussion segment, we added terms for the interaction of the
above variables with a variable indicating posts after the first pivotal post. A nested hypothesis test (2 log
likelihood test, Kennedy, 2004) with an alpha level of .05 was used to test whether each set of explanatory
variables   was  significant. Multi-level mediation  tests were  used to test if a variable M   mediated    an XY
relationship: XMY (Krull & MacKinnon, 2001).
         Finally, in   the  third phase of analysis  we  created an   explanatory  model  for  the KC  phase    of an
individual post. As above, we entered factors at multiple levels (e.g., activities, student characteristics, and post
characteristics). The procedure was the same as that of modeling pivotal posts with the following exceptions.
First, KC has 5 ordered values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), so multilevel, ordered logit was used rather than multilevel, binary
logit. Second, to examine differences in KC across discussion segments we added a variable that indicated posts
created After the 1st Pivotal Post. Third, in the Current Post Characteristics variable set, we did not include KC
since it is the outcome variable.

Results
Descriptive Statistics
Results confirmed that discussions were enacted without overrepresentations of posts from specific roles, from
specific students or in particular weeks. The ten assigned roles yielded equal numbers of posts, except for the
Starter and Wrapper roles which should and did make only one corresponding functional post per discussion.
Over   half the  posts were   in  KC Phase  1   (Sharing Information),  with  substantial numbers   in KC   Phase   3
(Negotiating    Meaning)    and   KC  Phase   5 (Agreeing   and   Applying).  Few   focused    on  discrepancies   or
contradictions (KC Phase 2 [Exploring Dissonance] or KC Phase 4 [Testing and Modifying]).
Identifying Pivotal Posts
The discussions averaged one pivotal post each (two time segments) and most segments had a majority of posts
in a single KC phase (see Figure 1). The Synthesizer and Wrapper roles contributed most of the pivotal posts,
and these pivotal posts often were Extensive Summaries in KC phases 3 or 5. Other pivotal posts had varied
characteristics.

          Figure 1. Example of a Discussions with 1 Pivotal Post (Yielding 2 Segments of Discussion).
Modeling Pivotal Posts
Assigned role and current post characteristics accounted for a substantial portion of the pivotal post variance
(28%,   see Figure    2). Compared   to other roles, Synthesizers'  and  Wrappers'  posts  were   more likely   to be
Extensive   Summaries,    and  Extensive  Summaries   were  more  likely than other functions  to  be  pivotal  posts.
Other  variables  (including  discussion  group and  post  order in the discussion) were   not significant. Notably,
Minor Summaries were not significantly more likely to be pivotal posts.

Modeling the KC Phase of Posts
Discussion segment, role, characteristics of the current post, and characteristics of the two prior posts accounted
for much of the variance in the KC phase of a post (see Figure 3). Only 23% of the differences in KC phases
occurred  across  discussions; 77%   of the  differences were    within  each  discussion.  Across  all discussions,
Synthesizers  and  Wrappers   posted  many   more   Summaries   compared    to other roles. Posts  with  Summaries
(Minor or Extensive) exhibited a higher KC phase on average. Thus, Synthesizer and Wrapper posts averaged
higher KC phases compared to other roles with the effect largely mediated by the Summary function.

         The results also show three time-specific relationships. First, the KC phase was substantially higher in
posts after a pivotal post than before one. Second, Summaries were more likely to occur after a pivotal post.
Third, there were two links between explanatory variables and KC phase that existed only after a pivotal post
has occurred: one, if the previous post had a New Idea, the current post averaged a lower KC phase; and two, if
a post was Responsive, the following post was more likely to be a New Idea and the KC phase was slightly
lower two posts later (indirect and direct effects combined). All other variables were not significant.    Notably,
the order of a post in the discussion did not affect the KC phase of a post, showing that later posts did not
necessarily show more advanced phases of KC. Furthermore, neither discussion group nor week explained a
significant amount of variance in the KC phase of post.

Discussion
The  study   revealed  a distinct KC  pattern  that emphasized   sharing  (Phase   1), negotiating  (Phase  3)  and
summarizing (Phase 5) ideas, but not dissonance (Phase 2) or testing tentative syntheses (Phase 4). A pivotal
post divided most discussions into two distinct segments. Segments were generally characterized by a majority
of posts in a single KC phase with later segments showing higher KC than earlier segments. The pivotal posts
that initiated later segments were typically contributed by students assigned the Synthesizer or Wrapper roles
and contained Extensive Summaries that elevated KC both immediately and in subsequent posts. Below we
discuss these results with respect to our research questions and the previous literature.
Research Question 1: What Pattern(s) Characterize the KC Process During An Online
Asynchronous Discussion with Assigned Roles?
Like   previous studies  of online  discussions with   assigned  roles, our analysis   allowed us  to   examine  the
proportions of posts in each KC phase. As in prior work (Gunawardena et al., 1997; Schellens et al., 2005), most
posts in this study were in KC Phase 1 (Sharing Information) showing that students produced new ideas much
more   often than they   considered existing ideas. In addition, similar to some  prior   findings (Schellens et al.
2007), this study also showed a greater proportion of posts in KC Phase 3 (Negotiating Meaning) than in Phase
2 (Exploring Dissonance). This is different from a pattern in which the proportion of posts decreases for each
successive KC phase (e.g. De Wever et al., 2007). In comparison with past studies, the learners in this study had
many more posts in KC Phase 5 (Agreeing and Applying), though still few posts in KC Phase 4 (Testing and
Modifying). The preponderance of posts in the initial (1) and convergent (3 and 5) phases and lack of posts in
judgmental KC phases (2 and 4) suggest that these groups were focused on reaching consensus.

CSCL 2011 Proceedings                                                                                   Volume I: Long Papers

         Moving beyond aggregate counts of posts, our analysis probed the process of knowledge construction
by identifying segments of KC patterns. This let us empirically test the underlying premise that groups construct
knowledge through a specific sequence of phases such as Gunawardena et al.'s (1997) theoretically proposed
patterns of KC. Most of the online discussions studied had at least two distinct segments of discussion (one
pivotal post), which rejects the KC Pattern 4 hypothesis (no distinct segments of KC). Segments were generally
characterized by a majority of posts in a single KC phase, with later segments showing higher KC; this rejects
the KC Patterns 1b and 2b hypotheses (which include regressive segments). In particular, the discussions often
had an initial segment with mostly KC Phase 1 posts (Sharing Information) followed by a statistically identified
pivotal post which elevated the discussion to a segment with a majority of posts in KC phases 3 or 5. This
rejects KC Pattern 1a (which requires a segment for each KC phase) and provides strong support for the KC
Pattern 2a hypothesis (strictly progressive segments with some KC phases skipped). However, nearly a quarter
of the later segments did not have a majority KC phase which also provides some support for the KC Pattern 3
hypothesis  (mixed    KC  phase    segments).   These  results differ from  the two     theoretically "complete"   patterns
suggested  by   Gunawardena      et  al. (1997; KC Patterns    1a and  1b), both  which    include  segments   for all  five
phases  of KC.   Notably,     in the original  conceptualization,  exploration  of   dissonance  and   testing  a proposed
synthesis are important to KC, but these results show that in some cases, groups can engage in KC Phase 5
processes without KC Phases 2 or 4 in this context. Importantly, while some disagreeing posts in KC Phases 2
and 4 were made, these contributions did not propel the group into a critique-focused segment of discussion.
The lack of disagreements in the discussions may be due to concerns about social relationships (Chiu, 2008b),
inadequate concern for the quality of the solution, or a notion of agreement as an indicator of a quality solution.
         Whether the absence of disagreements affects the quality of knowledge construction outcomes is an
important  question   both  empirically    and  theoretically and  at both  group  and   individual   levels. At  the group
level, exploration    of dissonance   between    ideas is thought  to  be  important    as a  foundation  for   quality co-
construction  of   knowledge.     At  the  individual  level,  the cognitive    dissonance    caused   by engaging      with
conflicting ideas is needed to trigger a learner to reconsider existing ideas and construct new understandings. In
future work, we will explore these issues by empirically studying how characteristics of the discussion process
(such as a lack of posts in Phases 2 and 4) influences independent learning outcome measures at both the group
and individual level.

Research Question 2: Does a Summary Midway through the Discussion Affect
Subsequent KC?
Like past studies, our results show that roles encouraging summarization (Synthesizer, Wrapper) yielded posts
in significantly higher KC phases than posts by roles which did not (De Wever et al., 2007; Schellens et al.,
2005; 2007;). More importantly, our temporal analysis allowed us to examine the effects of these summarizing
posts on the group's patterns of collaborative KC. As hypothesized, mid-discussion extensive summaries created
by students in the Synthesizer role were often pivotal posts that initiated new discussion segments with posts in
elevated phases of KC.     Due to a large number of late student posts, many Wrapper summaries inadvertently
ended up mid-discussion and also acted as pivotal posts that advanced the KC phase of the discussion. Notably,
only   one post with   a minor    summary   was  a pivotal post,   suggesting   that minor    summaries   are  qualitatively
different from extensive summaries.
         These results suggest that reading the extensive summaries facilitated learner contributions at higher
KC phases on average, thus advancing the group's KC process. Particularly, the integrative value of extensive
summaries    (Hara    et al., 2000)   can   help students  consolidate    their understanding    of   the different   ideas
contributed and draw on the previous discussion to negotiate shared understandings (KC Phase 3) or apply their
newly-constructed knowledge (KC Phase 5). In this way, the extensive summary can coordinate group activity
and ground subsequent discussion. This result illustrates the power of our temporal analysis to illuminate how
individuals' posts in a discussion can influence group processes of knowledge construction.

Conclusion
This study showed differences in KC phases of posts across time in an asynchronous online discussion. Notably,
most   discussions had    only   two discussion  phases,  unlike   Gunawardena,      et al.'s (1997)  5-phase    Interaction
Analysis Model. While past studies have shown that students benefit from writing a summary and that this can
be encouraged using assigned roles, this study used a temporal analysis to show that extensive summaries mid-
discussion can also change the tenor of the group's conversation and elevate it to higher KC phases. Future work
will examine how different KC discussion patterns can affect group and individual learning outcomes.
