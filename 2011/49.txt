          Abstract:    This study    reports on  classroom   studies   of knowledge     building,  supported   with
          Knowledge Forum, conducted over two years with two teachers new to knowledge building
          and their Grade 4 students. This study examines how the two teachers engaged in increasingly
          sophisticated    classroom   design    over  time, and    how   their students   moved     towards   more
          collective work and productive discourse. Obstacles and opportunities were identified as the
          researcher   worked     with the   teachers  to emphasize    principle-based     and collective    design.
          Analyses indicated that, over time, students participated more in Knowledge Forum in terms
          of  community    awareness    and   connectedness,    and moved     more   from   knowledge-sharing      to
          explanatory knowledge-building discourse. Analyses of students' posttest scores on science
          tests indicated that students' Knowledge Forum participation was positively correlated with
          domain   understanding.         Examining    new   teachers' shifts   in classroom   designs     and their
          students' changes towards explanatory discourse may have implications for identifying the
          developmental trajectories of knowledge-building dynamics and practice.

Introduction
Helping   students   to engage    in knowledge     building  is  an important     research  theme    in computer-supported
collaborative   learning   and    learning   sciences.  One   particular  model    of   knowledge     building,    also called
knowledge creation, focuses on the creation and improvement of ideas and public knowledge in communities.
When ideas are placed in the public, knowledge itself becomes an object of inquiry, and the community works
collectively to make collective advances (Bereiter, 2002; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). Knowledge Forum
(KF),  a computer-supported       collaborative  learning    environment,  is   a knowledge-creation       space that   enables
students to make their ideas public for progressive discourse and theory revision.
          Over   the  last 20   years, major     theoretical advances    have   been  made     with  theory,   pedagogy   and
technology of knowledge building (see special issue, Scardamalia, 2010). Research has shown that even young
children   are capable   of engaging      in collective   cognitive responsibility    to   create new   knowledge     (Zhang,
Scardamalia, Reeve & Messina, 2009). The knowledge building model has now been implemented by school
systems in many countries, and there is an increasing need to understand the dynamics of knowledge building
and how    it  can be  implemented     in  a range of   classrooms.    Whereas    attention has   been  given  to  how   more
experienced    knowledge-building      teachers  engage   in classroom    design   (Caswell    &  Bielaczyc,   2002),   less is
known    about    students'  knowledge-building       trajectories  and   knowledge-building       practice   among     novice
teachers.  The    goal  of  this  study   is  to characterize    knowledge-building      discourse,     in order   to identify
developmental      trajectories  and   to  explore  the   designs   that  facilitate  teachers    to make    these    changes.
Specifically, this study examines teacher and student growth trajectories by following, over the course of two
years, two Hong Kong teachers who teach the same curriculum topics and are both new to knowledge building.

Developmental Patterns of Knowledge-Building Dynamics and Discourse
Since the 1990s, considerable research has been conducted for characterizing knowledge-building processes and
dynamics.     Different patterns of knowledge building dynamics have been identified, for example, referent-based
versus   problem-centered knowledge (Oshima, Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1996); fact-based versus explanatory-
based inquiry (Hakkarainen, 2003); and depth of questions and explanations (Lee, Chan & van Aalst, 2006)
More   recently,   van  Aalst   (2009) has   identified   three  kinds of knowledge      building    discourse   ­ knowledge
sharing, knowledge construction, and knowledge creation ­ associated with the emergence of new knowledge
and social    dynamics.    Such   kinds   of analyses,    rather than  merely     coding   and counting     CSCL    discourse
categories,   imply   increasingly   sophisticated     patterns  of processes     and dynamics       in knowledge-building
discourse.    The  question   is, can  these   patterns   of  discourse   be  identified   to  characterize    developmental
trajectories of productive knowledge building?
          Analyzing     knowledge-building       dynamics    and trajectories is   useful, not only   for  characterizing  the
nature  of knowledge     building,   but  also for examining     changes   in   teacher  and  student   knowledge     building
practices.   Hakkarainen (2003) report on changing from fact-based to explanatory-based inquiry over a three
year period;   and Zhang et al's (2009) three-year design-study into changing fixed, interactive group dynamics
to opportunistic   group   dynamics    with   increased   community     awareness    and   community       connectedness,  for
example ­ have specifically examined changes over time.             These patterns may suggest pointers for identifying
and developing more sophisticated processes and practices. Nevertheless, most of these studies have involved

comparatively    sophisticated teachers, rather  than  investigating knowledge-building       dynamics    trajectories by
examining novice teachers' growth towards adopting knowledge-building innovation and tracking changes in
their students' discourse. The scheme of knowledge-building discourse (van Aalst, 2009) was identified among
Canadian high-school students; it would be useful to examine further possible developmental patterns and to
investigate whether    and  how   elementary    school children   change   from   knowledge-sharing       to knowledge-
construction and to knowledge-creation discourse.

From Activity-Based to Principle-Based Design
Questions   also exist  as to  how new   teachers  can adopt    more sophisticated    knowledge-building      practice to
facilitate more productive knowledge-building discourse. A major challenge for teachers working on inquiry-
based and knowledge creation model is to shift from tasks and activities to principle-based understanding for
classroom innovation.    The traditional classroom model is one of highly-structured initiate-response-evaluation
(IRE) patterns, with a focus on individuals, so how can teachers move towards designs for collective cognitive
responsibility?   Scardamalia and Bereiter (2006) contrast principle- and procedural-based approaches: A key
idea in principle-based innovation is that teachers need to go beyond activities and view principles as objects of
inquiry; knowledge-building principles can point to and scaffold collective designs(Scardamalia, 2002). There is
some evidence that principle-based understanding sustains teacher growth in school innovation (Zhang, Hong,
Scardamalia,  Reeve,    &  Messina,  in press). Research    has also shown   that   teachers  in a knowledge-building
network vary in how they emphasize principles versus activities, and that the students of those inclined towards
principle-based understanding have more sophisticated views of collaboration (Chan, in press). Accordingly,
this study examines the idea that as new teachers move towards principle-based collective designs, they are
better able to bring about changes in their students' productive discourse.
         To summarize, the research objectives for this study are to:      (1) examine teachers' classroom designs
and to investigate how they change from activity- towards principle-based designs over a two year period; (2)
investigate  how  teacher   change   in  classroom  designs     parallel their   students' change    towards    increased
community    connectedness    and explanatory   knowledge-building     discourse;   and (3)  examine   whether     student
engagement in knowledge building activity is related to their domain understanding.

Methods and Design

Participants
The participants were two elementary-school teachers (hereafter called TC and TT) and their Grade 4 students,
who    were examined    over  two  school  years (2008-09   and   2009-2010).    TC   and  TT    had 9 and    5 years  of
experience respectively, when they joined the project.      Both taught in a public school located in a low income
area of Hong Kong with children of low-average academic levels. In Year 1, TC's and TT's classes had 40 and
33 students respectively; in Year 2, the numbers were 39 and 29. The two teachers implemented the knowledge-
building approach in both semesters of both years; the selected topics were "Plants" and "Human Body". This
design  made  it  possible  to track how   these   new  teachers   made   change    and as   reflected in    their student
participation. To control for differences in student background and improvement due to a strong cohort, school
information  was  collected.  Students  in Year  1 and  Year    2 were   similar in terms  of School   Attainment    Test
scores (similar to standardized test scores), with Year 2 students in both classes being generally weaker.

Designing and Implementing Knowledge Building

Year One Implementation ­ Initial Work
While the two teachers both subscribed to student-centered learning, both emphasized steps and procedures: At
the start, they listed their strategies: Students would (a) read materials in library; (b) watch documentary films to
stimulate interest; (c) ask `wh' questions about the topic; (d) select the three most popular questions for KF
work; (e) learn KF functions; (f) participate in student discussions using KF; and (g) produce concept maps and
a learning diary. TC began with implementation ­ he was concerned that he could not deal with students raising
too many questions, thus only three questions were chosen for KF discussion. Figure 1a shows an interesting
pattern that is characteristic of teachers and students new to knowledge building ­ although many notes were
made, most were short and fragmented, and formed a kind of `spider-web' pattern around the centralized node
as students wrote responses to the parent question.
         Ongoing evaluation indicated that, while students were relatively engaged and that many notes were
posted, the  responses   were  superficial and  repetitive.  We    worked  with   the two   teachers   to identify   areas
needing refinement. Fig 1a shows that students viewed discourse as a question-answer pattern, analogous to the
teacher asking a question that had to be answered. Moreover, they did not see that the discourse is intended to
build on and extend others' ideas for community advances, and kept giving the same responses, mostly short
answers with no explanation. Students typically just answered the question or clicked on a random note. TT and

TC worked    with  each   other   - While  TT    also used  three questions  and   responses   were   still fragmented  and
descriptive, the  spider-web    pattern   seen   in TC's   class did  not  exist  in his. TT   and  TC   were   sufficiently
impressed with what their low-achieving students could do using KF, that they continued the project with the
next semester's topic, the Human Body. After an initial phase of question-answer responses, students became
more engaged in posing questions and building on each others' responses. Discourse was still superficial but
improving to more divergent pattern (Fig 1b) -- students tended to ask questions about difficult terminology
(what is X or Y?) without linking them to the problem at hand.

Year Two Implementation ­ Towards Principle-Based Design
Throughout Years 1 and 2, TT and TC worked with the researchers and other peer teachers in the context of a
knowledge-building      teacher network    (Chan,   in press).  Teachers  were    encouraged   to   view classroom  design
problems  as    objects  of inquiry   and  they  also  employed    technology     in ways   that  are connected    with  the
principles. Focus was placed on principle-based design emphasizing individual to collectivist stances.              As TT
and TC worked on the same topics with parallel classes, they helped scaffold each others' advances. The change
process was gradual and emergent; classroom designs of Year 2 informed with principles are described:
         Epistemic agency.      TC and TT no longer restricted the number of questions posed by their students,
and became more comfortable letting students ask the questions they needed to have answered. TT noted that
students would   give    deeper   responses  when     they felt they  were  asking   questions   to which   they genuinely
wanted   answers. While     their goal  is to help    students  develop  collective  agency,   it was not an exercise in
discovery learning; they worked with their students to connect their wonderment with big ideas in the domain.
         Community knowledge.         The teachers addressed the problem of repetition by using the analogy that
people in a conversation do not keep repeating what others have already said; rather, they listen to what has
been going on and move forward the conversation. The teachers helped students to change gradually from the
predominant     question-answer     patterns  to ones   that   involve  interaction,  contribution,   and   discourse -- A
divergent and distributed pattern now emerged. While TT and TC had asked students to work in groups in Year
1, later they created an overall view and used rise-above notes to develop community knowledge (Figure 1c).
         Improvable     Ideas.  To   help  students   move   past  shallow  knowledge-sharing,      a  major   change   was
introduced   in Year   2 ­  the use  of "knowledge-building       talks" in which    students' emerging     questions were
reflected upon. TC worked with students on what he called `cutting-edge' recommended notes. In the past, some
important  ideas  might  have   gotten  lost;  and  students    shied away  from  difficult questions;   now   the teachers
encouraged students to help each others to improve their ideas.
         Constructive use of information.           TC and   TT  provided   their students  with  relevant   information to
encourage them to move beyond chit-chatting and sharing opinion.            Both teachers were working on the problem
in that some students simply copied the information from the web into their KF notes without interpretation.
         Embedded assessment.        While the teachers were concerned with assessment, in Y1, they asked students
to reflect on their understanding using concept map in paper and pencil. Over time in Year 2, both teachers were
better able to use collective assessment with reference notes on Knowledge Forum..

Community Awareness and Connectedness (Applets ­Note-Reading and Build-On Density)
Data   were collected  to examine    whether the  two   teachers  had  changed   over time, based    on their students'
participation and collaboration patterns on Knowledge Forum. The mean number of notes written were 8.7 to
16.7 for TC and 4.5 to 19.5 for TT' classes in Yr 1 and 2. We employed two Knowledge Forum assessment
Applet indices ­ "Note-Reading Density" and "Build-on Density" to gauge student progress in the knowledge
building  community;    the  indices are similar   to  Social  Network   Analyses, but  simpler   to  use.  Density  is
calculated as the ratio between the actual number of links and the maximum possible number of links.          Zhang et
al. (in press) note that the extent to which students read others' notes reflects "community awareness" and that
building on reflects "community connectedness"; both are used here to indicate whether students are moving
towards  more  community     cohesion.  There   were   changes in   Read-Density (TC:   84.5%--100%;     TT:  79.3%--
93.65%) and Build-on Density (TC: 29.2% ­32.7%; TT 18.6%--43.9%) over the two year period. Figures 2                and
3 show the changing patterns using Applet visualization patterns for build-on notes. These results indicate that
students of both teachers had more connected interactions on KF participation comparing Year 1 and Year 2.

Participation and Collaboration (Analytic Toolkit Indices)
Student participation on KF was obtained using server log information via Analytic Toolkit, a software with
Knowledge    Forum..   Several  indices used   in previous  studies  were  generated  including  "write",   "revision",
"scaffolds", "keywords", "read", and "link" (Lee et al., 2006). Figs 4 & 5 show changes in student participation
over the two years for the ATK indices. To provide a more coherent analysis, the ATK participation indices
were factor analyzed, and two factors were obtained called "Productivity" (write, read, revise, scaffolds) and
"Collaboration" (linked,   keywords),   consistent  with  findings   in other studies (Lee  et  al., 2006).   Statistical
analysis indicates marginally significant differences between Years 1 and 2 for ATK Productivity, F =3.34, p
<.08; and significant differences for ATK Collaboration, F       = 4.17, p <.05 with higher ATK scores in Year 2.
When the two classes were examined separately, there were differences for TT's class but not TC's classes.
Taken together, these two sets of quantitative indices (Applets + ATK) suggest that there was more participation,
collaboration and connectedness among student cohorts for the teachers over the two years.

Changes in Discourse Over Two Year

Characterizing and Analyzing Knowledge-Building Discourse
Students' forum  writing    was analyzed  for   discourse   quality by  adapting Zhang  et  al' notion   of conceptual
threads (2007) grouping forum notes into different discussion/inquiry threads. These discourse threads rather
than individual notes or adjacent pairs were the unit of analysis for tracking changes in knowledge quality.
Discussion threads were then coded into four levels using the idea of different types of knowledge-building
discourse (van Aalst, 2009):
·   Fragmented discussion.      Short discussion threads with fragmented responses; an example is the pattern of
    short answers and questions as described in Figure 1.
·   Knowledge-sharing discourse. There are two types: short threads in which a student asks a question and
    someone responds often using information copied off of the internet. The second involves conversational
    interaction in which opinions or information is shared without supporting evidence or explanation. Table 1
    shows   an example    in which   a student  asks   what might   happen if a  person had  only    one lung. Several

    students respond    with either opinions or  general ideas   (#3-6). There  was  interaction but  no  attempt  to
    formulate  the    problem  to understand    the respiratory   system.  The  discourse  then     degenerates  into
    conversations about lung disease and that thinner people are weaker and more susceptible to lung diseases
    (#11-12). Although students are interacting, they are primarily exchanging opinions.

  1. HSH     Asks a question        I need to understand      We have a pair of lungs. If we only have one side of
                                    the lung, can we still breathe? Why?
  2. CCY     shares opinion         My theory    If we only have one side of the lung, we can still breathe,
                                    because the only reason for us to have a pair of lungs is to breathe smoothly.
                                    If we only have one side of the lung, we cannot breathe smoothly.
  3. LYH     shares opinion         My theory    Lung helps us to breathe. We can breathe with one side of the
                                    lung. We will certainly die, if we do not have a pair of lungs.
  4. CT      shares opinion         My theory    I guess we cannot breathe with one side of the lung.
  5. CWY     shares opinion         My theory    Can breathe.
  6. YMH     shares opinion         My theory    Yes, but it would be much harder. The job to breathe should
                                    be done by a pair of lungs, but now it is done by one side of the lung only.
  7. WHY     share opinion          My theory    One side of the lung is also a respiratory system, though
                                    breathing is pretty hard.
  8. CWY     Asks a question        I need to understand      why do we not die with one side of the lung?
  9. LYK     digression             I need to understand      What will happen if there is a hole in the lungs?
  10. CCY    shares opinion         My theory    It is called burst lungs. It makes breathing very difficult. It
                                    usually happens in people who are thin and tall.
  11. CWY    Asks a question        I need to understand      Why people who are thin and tall often have burst
                                    lungs?
  12. YHC    shares opinion         My theory    Because those thin and tall people are weak.

are long, and only selected notes are included here to highlight the key features.

·   Knowledge-construction     discourse.  Attempts  were     made by  students to  construct understanding      using
    questions and explanations. Table 2 shows an example in which a student asks why plants release carbon
    dioxide at night (#1). Another student responds that plants release carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen at
    night  and the    other way round  in   the morning,  which    leads to a  discussion of  the   role of CO2    in
    photosynthesis (#3-5). There are good efforts to build on others' ideas with questions and explanation.

1. MT          asks a question               I need to understand   How do non-green plants produce chlorophyll
                                           and nutrition?
2. YLT         poses idea thus               My theory    Non-green plants cannot have photosynthesis; therefore,
               misconception can be        they are parasite on plants that have chlorophyll. They absorb nutrition
               inquired further            from other plants.
3. TSH         indicates puzzlement          I need to understand   How can non-green plants be parasite on green
               & asks for                  plants, and how can they absorb nutrition from other plants? (What is
               explanation                 the process of such absorption?)
4. LLY         Provides explanation          My theory    In fact, similar to green-plants, non-green plants contain
                                           chlorophyll. Non-green plants do not need to produce chlorophyll, and
                                           they produce nutrition the same way as other plants.
5. KCY         asks a question               I need to understand   How do red leaves have photosynthesis? Why?
6. MHH         hypothesizes and              My theory    Red leaves also have chlorophyll, even though such
               proposes an                 chlorophyll is red in color instead of green in color. We can conduct the
               experiment                  same experiment shown in the textbook... Put red leaves in a test tube,
                                           and then pour iodine on the leave... We can test whether the red leaf can
                                           have photosynthesis or not?
7.KCY          Clarifying question           I need to understand   Is it call "red" chlorophyll?
8. LKH         Uses new                      My theory    ... the major pigment in chlorophyll is green in color.

               construct                   Information    ...For example, red algae contain "algae bile pigment";
               explanation;                brown algae contain a "black algae yellow substance."...    My theory
               deepening inquiry           Those color [crowd out] the green color in chlorophyll. That is why we

               information--my             the light and move the energy to chlorophyll? Such other colors are
               theory)                     indirectly involved in the process of photosynthesis...
Note: The Chinese translation of chlorophyll includes the word `green', thus students were puzzled about
whether non-green plants have chlorophyll and how they can make food.

Changes in Quality of Discourse and More Sustained Inquiry
Student discourse in both years and with both teachers was grouped into discussion threads and coded into the
four   levels (Table  4)  indicating   an improvement    in discourse  patterns. Specifically, the   number  show  that
knowledge-sharing      patterns decreased     over   time,  while  knowledge-construction      threads  and  emergent
knowledge-creation threads increased. Ongoing analyses were conducted to establish inter-rater reliability for
the coding of these threads. Since knowledge building involves sustained inquiry, to provide a fuller picture, the
threads  were  plotted   to illustrate the extent to  which   students were continuing with    their inquiry over time
versus short threads for question-answer. Figures 6 and 7 show the discourse threads for the topic `plants' for
TT and TC (Yr 1 & 2). The plots of the discussion threads indicate some distinctive differences ­ Comparing
Years 1 and 2, students wrote more threads, and these threads lasted for more days suggesting that students of
these teachers were more engaged and sustained in their knowledge-building inquiry.

Relations between Participation on Knowledge Forum and Domain Understanding
The third research question examines whether student engagement with knowledge building measured by their
participation  on  Knowledge    Forum     is related to their domain   understanding, We  collected    data  from (a) a
domain test that consists of two questions (what have you learned? what would you like to find out?) and (b)
examination    scores  in general  science   as students' regular  assessment practice in schools.   We  followed    the
approach employed in other studies (Lee et al., 2006) and coded student responses using a 5-point scale ranging
from fragmented to scientific responses. The four scores from the two units (Plants and Human Body) were
combined, yielding mean domain test scores of 2.5 (TC) and 2.8 (TT). Analyses were conducted to examine if

student participation on Knowledge Forum, as measured by ATK indices, was related to domain understanding.
As mentioned    above,    factor analyses   of the indices  generated  two  factors ­ ATK    "Productivity"     and ATK
"Collaboration".     Correlation analyses  indicated   that students' domain  test  scores  were correlated  with   ATK
Collaboration (r = .26, , p <. 04); and school exam scores were correlated with ATK Productivity (r = .28, p
<.03). Separate analyses showed stronger patterns in TC's class. Overall in both classes, students' participation
indices on Knowledge Forum were significantly related to their domain understanding.

Discussion
Despite the enthusiasm the knowledge-building model inspires, its emphasis on collective work is difficult for
teachers  and  students   alike. Whereas   many    knowledge-building   studies report   on  experienced    teachers, this
paper examines the challenges facing new teachers as they gradually make changes towards more principle-
based designs, and how their students develop more cohesive interactions and productive discourse.
          This study   has examined     the  characterization and  developmental    trajectory   of knowledge-building
discourse in the context of how two teachers move towards more sophisticated knowledge-building design over
time.    The   first  question   examined   the teachers'   change from   activity-based  to principle-based    and from
individual to collective designs. A key theme is that the two teachers, working with the researchers and the
teacher  network,    were engaged    in a design-based   process,  examining  student  problems     and advances    while
making needed refinements. The teachers' initial design restricted the number of questions students posed; the
results showed spider-web patterns that reflected students' beliefs about how questions are to be answered and
other  related problems,   such   as repetitive   responses  and lack  of explanation.   Examining     these debilitating
patterns may help new teachers to understand key principles of knowledge building, and to emphasize epistemic
agency   and  community    knowledge.      There   are various  ways   in which  the  teachers   worked   with  students,
employing key principles, such as helping students to identify productive areas of inquiry for improvable ideas.
Figure  1 shows   the  gradual   progression   of  student  work on   KF  ­ from   spider  web   (Fig. 1a),  to divergent
responses (Fig. 1b), to an integrated view (Fig. 1c); and there were changes from using a paper-pencil concept-
map    to KF reflective assessment with reference notes      reflecting attempts towards a meta-discourse. At various
phases,  the  teachers  were     concerned  with   continual  refinements   and how   their  students'  work    could  be
improved. The two new teachers worked closely supporting each other; their patterns of results suggest both

CSCL 2011 Proceedings                                                                                 Volume I: Long Papers

made   progress  over   the years.   Examining  how    new  teachers   adapt    different designs  and   grappling  with
principles may have implications for knowledge-building design and professional development.
         Another key theme of this paper characterizes the nature and development of the knowledge-building
discourse through     examining  knowledge-building     practice at different  times. The   second  question   examined
knowledge building participation and discourse among the children over the two-year period. Quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that children in Year 2, compared to Year 1, participated more actively on Knowledge
Forum, with increased community connectedness, and they were more engaged in productive discourse. These
results suggest that changes in teacher practice using principle-based design might have helped to bring about
more community cohesion and sustained discourse in the class community. The third question indicating the
relation between Knowledge Forum engagement and domain understanding is reassuring to the teachers; the
results are consistent with other studies conducted in Hong Kong classrooms (see Lee et al., 2006).
         Analyses indicate discourse of school children in Hong Kong can be differentiated into different types
including knowledge sharing, knowledge construction, and emerging knowledge creation (van Aalst, 2009). For
knowledge sharing, children are interacting but they are involved with sharing opinion with little explanation or
evidence. Knowledge construction suggests their efforts to develop some understanding; question-explanation is
important discourse moves. For emerging knowledge creation, it seems that even elementary school students
can engage  in  scientific  discourse, reflecting efforts towards   collective  inquiry   and  theory   building and the
notion that ideas and theory can be tested and revised through experimentation. The changes among teachers
and students   over   the two years  suggest possible   developmental   progression    that has  theoretical and  design
implications. The different kinds of discourse threads can be employed by teachers for examining students'
work and scaffolding students towards more productive discourse.           Further investigation can be conducted to
investigate how   teachers  shift from  procedures   to principles  as they   scaffold their   students to change   from
knowledge-sharing towards explanatory-based knowledge-creation discourse.
