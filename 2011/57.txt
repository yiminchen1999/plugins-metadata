         Abstract:    The goal  of  this research is  to examine    the   extent to which  contributing    to a
         Knowledge Building online dialogue can predict individual advancement of knowledge for
         Grade 4 students. Based on the procedures of grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), we
         examined     notes  that grade    4 students    entered  into  an  online   discourse    environment
         (Knowledge     Forum)   and developed   the   following  empirically    grounded  list of contributor
         roles: asking thought-provoking questions, theorizing, experimenting, working with evidence,
         creating  syntheses    and  analogies, and    supporting   discussion.   Regression      analysis  was
         performed to examine whether any of these roles can predict various measures of individual
         knowledge     advancement.    The analysis   revealed  two   significant predictors:   theorizing  and
         working with evidence. Theorizing accounts for variation in scientificness of students' ideas
         as well   as knowledge   test scores; working   with   evidence  predicts  epistemic   complexity    of
         students' portfolios. These results inform next steps in creating classroom interventions and
         technology tools for collaborative knowledge creation.

Introduction
Knowledge creation and innovation have risen to high prominence in the economic sphere (David & Foray,
2003) and for societal problem solving (Homer-Dixon, 2006). From this perspective, capacity for knowledge
creation represents a major challenge for education (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2006; Carnevale & Desrochers,
2003: Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2007). Among educational approaches that can claim special relevance in this
respect (e.g., project-  and problem-based    learning,  "21st  Century   Skills" programs),    "Knowledge    Building"
stands out as most directly addressing the need for knowledge-creating talent. Defined as the deliberate creation
and improvement of knowledge that has value for a community (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2003), Knowledge
Building is synonymous with knowledge creation. Individual knowledge workers, often in teams, make diverse
contributions to the collective knowledge in a domain through efforts that preserve and elaborate the current
paradigm, make incremental moves in existing directions, or redirect the field into a new direction or paradigm
(Sternberg, 2003). Thus, Knowledge Building challenges students to be not only learners but active contributors
to group   efforts to  produce  epistemic    artifacts--explanations,  problem    formulations,   proofs,   experimental
methods, "state of the art" reviews, and the like. These epistemic artifacts are collectively improved through a
wide variety of individual student contributions, ranging from drawing useful diagrams to suggesting pertinent
analogies and theories. Being complimentary, these contributions form a highly interactive "self-organizing"
system  (Resnick,  1996),   moving   knowledge-creating    dialogue   forward    without  central authority.  Both  parts
symmetrically benefit from this interaction: the community, as a whole, and individual contributors. However,
individual  benefits  might  fluctuate,  depending    on the   degree  of the individual's  participation    and  his/her
contributor roles in the community's dialogue. That is the focus of the present research--examining the extent
to which   contributing   to a  Knowledge     Building   online  dialogue  can    predict  individual advancement       of
knowledge in elementary school students.
         A  number    of collaborative   knowledge    creating approaches  make     use of assigned   roles.  Edward    de
Bono   (1985)  distinguishes  six different  thinking  strategies symbolized     by six   colored  hats: a  black   hat is
associated with critical thinking, a green hat with idea generation, a white hat with providing information and
facts, etc. Leng, Lai, and Law (2008) elaborated a taxonomy of ways of contributing on the basis of levels of
cognitive  complexity.   Hogan    (1999),  observing   student  interactions  in  science  discourse,    identified eight
naturally occurring roles similar to de Bono's "six hats:" promoter of reflection, contributor of content, creative
model   builder, mediator    of group    interactions and  ideas, etc.  The   current   research   aims  to  develop    an
empirically grounded list of contributor roles of a finer grain than the above, and to examine the extent to which
these roles can predict individual knowledge gain in the context of Knowledge Building. Thus, analyses focus
on: (a) creating a systematic inventory of contributor roles, based on analysis of student online discussions; (b)
identifying measures of individual knowledge advancement; and (c) studying the relationships between these
two components.

Method

Knowledge Building Environment
In order to answer the research questions, we selected an elementary school site-- Dr. Eric Jackman Institute of
Child Study of the University of Toronto--where "Knowledge Building discourse" supported by Knowledge
Forum   technology    (Scardamalia      &  Bereiter, 2003)   is integral   to the day-to-day    work  of the  class. Students
reference, evaluate,   build   on,   and  work   to  continually improve      ideas--their  own  and   those  of  community
members. The quality of Knowledge Building discourse is increased through giving students greater collective
responsibility  for   advancing   ideas   (Zhang,   Scardamalia,  Lamon,      Messina   and  Reeve,   2007).  Mirroring    and
extending  their    face-to-face    discussions,    students   work   in   an    online environment--Knowledge          Forum
(Scardamalia, 2002)--that provides a community space for collaborative work with ideas, the stored record of
which   constitutes   data for   the present     research. Of   particular relevance    to this research  are the  following
characteristics of  Knowledge       Forum:   (a) "build-on,"    reference, linking,  and   annotation  features  that support
interaction; (b) views that support graphical as well as textual literacy; (c) "rise-above" notes that facilitate the
creation of higher-order knowledge structures; and (d) "scaffolds" (i.e. "My theory", "I need to understand",
"New   information")     that make   it easy   for users   and  researchers   to identify  and  tag  contributor roles. These
features  enable  research    of  a depth    not possible  with  typical   discourse    environments,  yet findings   will be
applicable to efforts to improve discourse in other on-line and face-to-face environments.
          This study focuses on a Grade 4 inquiry of optics supported by Knowledge Forum. Both the teacher
and  students  had    multiple years    of experience    with  Knowledge      Building   pedagogy    and technology,    so the
situation  represents    what  Fischer     and   Bidell  (1997)  call  "optimal    conditions"   for  identifying    cognitive
developmental    goals.  The   study    uses the  same  dataset  as examined      by Zhang   et  al. (2007), but  focuses  on
individual ways of contributing to the collective discourse, to complement group-level variables. It explores
students'  patterns   of contribution     and  examines    how   these patterns    enhance   (or impede)   advancement      of
individual knowledge.

Participants and Dataset
The participants were 22 Grade 4 students (11 girls and 11 boys) and their teacher from the Dr. Eric Jackman
Institute of Child Study, University of Toronto. The teacher has been committed to Knowledge Building and
used   Knowledge    Forum     for   the previous    two  years. He  worked       collaboratively with  students   to  identify
problems of understanding and to discuss diverse ideas and theories through class face-to-face discourse. During
the lessons, students were encouraged to conduct self-generated experiments, to search libraries as well as the
Internet for interesting facts and to share new resources through cooperative reading. In parallel to these offline
activities, students recorded their ideas, theories and findings in the Knowledge Forum database. This shared
database   helped   students   to   keep   their top-level  questions  in   sight, while   refining   and  improving    newly
generated theories. On a daily basis students were free to explore any problem related to the topic in question,
and to contribute to the database.
          The dataset analyzed below covers four months of online discourse on optics, including topics such as
"How light travels," "Colors of light," "Natural and artificial light," "Shadows" and so forth (see Zhang et al.,
2007 for details of the inquiry processes). A total of 318 notes have been analyzed in this study: 70% of all
notes were students' personal notes (written by individual students), 20% were group notes (written by small
groups of 2-5 students) and 6% were teacher's notes. This analysis examined only personal notes.

Analysis

Ways of Contributing List
On the basis of informal observation and the knowledge creation literature, a provisional list of contribution
types was first created. This list was used to inform and guide our analysis of student online discourse that
followed a grounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967), with the categories elaborated, refined, then
modified, and extended. Table 1 displays six major categories identified through the above process, consisting
of 20 sub-categories in total.

                                                            support or reject a previous idea, but extend it

                                                            creating an analogy to explain a particular

                         Initiating a rise-above            Student summarizes previous ideas by integrating
                                                            multiple notes into a rise-above note.

                         Giving an opinion                  Student gives an opinion, but no explanation or

                         Acting as a mediator               Student supports discussion by focusing on social
                                                            roles rather than ideas.

         Three independent raters used these categories to code the notes. When the same note fell into more
than one contribution type, all related categories were counted. For example, if in the same note a student asked
the question (e.g. "How light travels?"), proposed a theory to answer this question (e.g. "My theory is that light
travels in a straight line") and included a diagram to make this theory visual, then three contribution types were
counted: formulating an explanatory question, proposing an explanation, and using diagrams to communicate or
support ideas. The three raters agreed in 80% of the coding. The remaining 20% were discussed to achieve
consensus. Finally, in order to examine individual contributor patterns, the total number of contributions made
by any individual student was calculated for each major category and sub-category.

Measures of Individual Knowledge Advancement
Individual knowledge     advancement   was  assessed  through content  analysis  (Chi, 1997) of    student personal
portfolio notes and a teacher-designed test. Each student wrote a portfolio note at the end of the optics inquiry to
summarize what he/she had learned about light. Each portfolio note was divided into idea units, which were
analyzed focusing on the scientific and epistemic levels of student ideas (see Zhang et al., 2007 for details).
         Scientificness  of student ideas was  assessed using  a  four-point scale:  1­pre-scientific (containing a
misconception while applying a naive conceptual framework), 2­hybrid (containing misconceptions that have
incorporated scientific information), 3­basically scientific (containing ideas based on a scientific framework,
but not  precise) or  4­scientific (containing explanations  that are consistent with  scientific knowledge).   This

coding  scheme     was  developed on  the basis of Galili and   Hazan's   (2000) facets'-scheme   framework   for
analyzing student optical knowledge.
         Epistemic    complexity of ideas was   assessed  using  a rating scale  with the following   levels: 1­
Unelaborated facts (containing simple description of terms, phenomena or experiences without elaboration); 2­
Elaborated   facts (containing elaborated  description of terms,   phenomena  or  experiences);   3­Unelaborated
explanations (containing reasons, relationships or mechanisms without elaboration); 4­Elaborated explanations
(containing elaborated versions of reasons, relationships, or mechanisms). To assess inter-rater reliability, two
coders independently coded 12 portfolio notes: Cohen's Kappa = .83 for scientific sophistication and .75 for
epistemic complexity (see Zhang & Messina, 2010 for details).
         Teacher-designed test. The test was composed of 18 questions and administered at the end of the unit.
It covered 10 of the 28 themes addressed in online discussions (e.g. shadows, rainbows.), with a full score of 54.

Results and Discussion

Distribution of Contributor Roles
Table 2 reports the frequency and percentage of each way of contributing identified from the student-generated
optical discourse, including major and sub-category. Diverse ways of contributing were evident, connecting to
and supporting one another for sustained, deepening discourse. The most frequent contribution types were those
related to theorizing and working with evidence.

Table 2: Frequency of occurrence and percentages of contribution types (means and standard deviations).

Regression Analysis
Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to predict scientificness, epistemic complexity of ideas, and
test scores from different contributor roles. Considering low occurrences observed for certain sub-categories,
only   major categories  were  used  as candidate  predictors, notably: questioning,  theorizing, experimenting,
working with evidence, creating syntheses and analogies, and supporting discussion.

Scientificness of Ideas
The overall regression, including 1 of the 5 candidate predictors, was statistically significant R = .43, R2 = .19,
adjusted R2 = .15, F(1, 20) = 4.57, p < .05 (using a stepwise method). As indicated in Table 3, working with
evidence accounted for about 19% of the variation in idea scientificness. The other five predictors did not enter
the equation, failing to add to prediction based on scientificness alone.

         Analysis     of results showed   that working   with evidence  during Knowledge    Building  dialogue was                        a
significant predictor of scientificness of individual ideas. More precisely, students who were actively searching
authoritative sources, bringing new facts to discussions and using these facts to support or falsify ideas were
able to increase scientificness of their own understanding. Thus, searching and processing the information for
the community had a beneficial effect on individual knowledge.

Epistemic Complexity of Ideas
Multiple linear regression    analysis  was  performed   to predict  epistemic level of  ideas in portfolios from                        six
major  contributor    roles. The  overall regression, including  1   of the 5  candidate predictors,  was statistically
significant R = .61, R2 = .37, adjusted R2 = .34, F(1, 20) = 11.76, p < .01 (using stepwise method). As shown in
Table 4, theorizing accounted for about 37% of the variation in the epistemic level of ideas. The other five
predictors did not enter the equation, failing to add to prediction based on theorizing alone (even though most of
these predictors had a significant zero-order correlation with it).

merely isolated facts.

Knowledge Test Scores
Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to predict knowledge test scores. The total N for this sample
was 20; two cases were dropped due to missing data on at least one variable, and therefore for this analysis N =
20. The overall regression, including 1 of the 5 candidate predictors, was statistically significant R = .51, R2 =
.26, adjusted R2 = .22, F(1, 18) = 6.33, p < .05 (using stepwise method). Working with evidence was the only
significant predictor, explaining approximately 26% of the variance in the knowledge test scores (see Table 5
for details). Other   five   factors were  not   significantly predictive   of the scores  (even  though   there was                     a
significant zero-order correlation for theorizing).

         Correlation    analysis indicated  that  there was  a relationship between     knowledge test  scores  and                     two
major  contributor    roles: theorizing  and working    with   evidence. Both   roles were   positively associated  with
content knowledge, but only the second one was significantly predictive of this knowledge. More particularly,
active search of information in authoritative sources and exposure of this information to the community in order
to support or falsify existing explanations helped students to increase their own content knowledge.

Conclusion
The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which contributing to a Knowledge Building online dialogue
can predict individual advancement of knowledge in elementary school students. Toward this end, a systematic
inventory of contributor roles was created including six major ways of contributing: questioning, theorizing,
experimenting, working with evidence, creating syntheses and analogies, and supporting discussion. These roles
were   entered   as   candidate  predictors  of  three  individual   knowledge    measures:   scientificness, epistemic
complexity    of ideas  in   portfolios and  knowledge   test  scores. Analysis    of results revealed  two   significant
predictors: working with evidence and theorizing. The first one proved to significantly account for scientificness
of ideas in student portfolios and knowledge test scores. Active use of empirical evidence and information from
authoritative sources to support and develop ideas in community discourse led to high scores in both individual
knowledge measures. The second predictor, theorizing, explained significant amount of variation in epistemic
complexity    of ideas  in students'  portfolios. More   precisely,  active generation,  support and    improvement                     of
explanations     during  Knowledge      Building    discourse  predicted    high   epistemic   complexity   of   student
understanding.   Developing     deeper  explanations  and examining    them    in light of information  and   knowledge
from the larger field and collected evidence represent major ways of contributing to knowledge advancement in
real world knowledge-creating communities (Bereiter, 2002; Sternberg, 2003). The present study confirmed the
importance of fostering such contributions among students in order for them to work as productive Knowledge
Building communities. Complimentary qualitative analysis of these ways of contributing is in progress. The
combined   findings   will   inform  next steps  of creating classroom   interventions   and  technology  designs  (e.g.,
visualizing theory-evidence coherence, scaffolding, etc.) to support theorizing and working with evidence and
authoritative sources for knowledge advancement. The sample size in this study was relatively small; future
studies will use a larger sample of participants to re-examine the findings of this study, as well as identify new
predictive relationships at the finer sub-category level.

         The variety of ways of contributing to Knowledge Building dialogues that were examined in this study
address knowledge creation and collaboration skills that lie at the core of 21st Century Skills (Partnership for
21st Century Skills, 2004). With all so-called "higher-order skills," a crucial and frequently ignored issue is
their transferability (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 2006). Although it was beyond the scope of this study to examine
transfer beyond the classroom, further research will be needed to examine transfer across different curriculum
topics; positive results will lend support to the idea that developing distinctive ways of contributing can give
students something transferable and helpful for them to become productive citizens in a knowledge society.
