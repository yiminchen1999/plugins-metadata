         Abstract: The ability of people to understand each other and to work together face-to-face is
         grounded in their sharing of our meaningful natural and cultural world. CSCL groups--such
         as virtual math teams--have to co-construct their shared world with extra effort. A case study
         of building shared understanding online illustrates these aspects: Asking each other questions
         is one common way of aligning perceptions. Literally looking at the same aspect of something
         as someone else helps us to see what each other means. The co-constructed shared world has
         social   and   temporal    as   well  as    objective  dimensions.    This   virtual  world    grounds
         communicative, interpersonal, and task-related activities for online groups, making possible
         group cognition that exceeds the limits of the individual cognition of the group members.

The Shared World of Meaning
We all find others and ourselves within one world. We learn about and experience the many dimensions of this
world together, as we mature as social beings. Infants learn to navigate physical nature in the arms of caregivers,
toddlers acquire their mother tongue by speaking with others, adolescents are socialized into their cultures, and
adults master the artifacts of the built environment designed by others. The world is rich with socially endowed
meaning,   and  we    perceive and  experience   it  as immediately   meaningful.    Because   we  share  the  meaningful
world, we can understand each other and can work together on concerns in common. Our activities around our
common concerns provide a shared structuring of our world in terms of implicit goals, interpersonal relations,
and temporal dimensions. These structural elements are reflected in our language: in references to artifacts, in
social positioning, and in use of tenses. All of this is understood the same by us unproblematically based on our
lived  experience  of  the shared   world. Of  course    there are  occasional  misunderstandings,     particularly  across
community boundaries, but these are exceptions that prove the rule of shared understanding in general.
         The "problem" of establishing intersubjectivity is a pseudo-problem in most cases. Human existence is
fundamentally   intersubjective     from  the start. We   understand    the  world   as  a shared   world   and  we   even
understand ourselves through the eyes of others and in comparison with others (Mead, 1934/1962). Rationalist
philosophy--from Descartes to cognitive science--has made this into a problem by focusing on the mind of the
individual as  if  it were isolated  from  the  world   and   from  other people.   That   raises the  pseudo-problem   of
epistemology: how can the individual mind know about states of the world and about states of other minds?
Rationalist philosophy culminated in an information-processing view of human cognition, modeled on computer
architecture: understanding (as described by Dreyfus, 1992) is viewed as primarily consisting of a collection of
mental representations (or propositions) of facts stored in a searchable memory.
         Critiques of the rationalist approach (e.g., Dreyfus, 1992; Schön, 1983; Suchman, 1987; Winograd &
Flores,  1986)  have   adopted    a phenomenological     (Heidegger,   1927;   Husserl,    1936;  Merleau-Ponty,     1945),
hermeneutical     (Gadamer,    1960/1988),    or    ethnomethodological      (Garfinkel,   1967)   approach,    in   which
understanding   is grounded    in being-in-the-world-together,     in cultural-historical  traditions, and  in tacit social
practices. This   led  to  post-cognitive  theories,    with a focus  on  artifacts, communities-of-practice,      situated
cognition, distributed cognition, group cognition, activity, and mediations by actor-networks. Human cognition
is recognized to be a social product (Hegel, Marx, Vygotsky) of interaction among people, over time, within a
shared world. Knowledge is no longer viewed as primarily mental representations of individuals, but includes
tacit  procedural  knowledge    (Polanyi,  1966),    designed   artifacts (Hutchins,    1996), physical    representations
(Latour,   1992),  small-group    processes   (Stahl,   2006),  embodied     habits  (Bourdieu,   1972/1995),   linguistic
meanings (Foucault, 2002), activity structures (Engeström, Miettinen & Punamäki, 1999), community practices
(Lave,  1991),  and   social institutions (Giddens,     1984). The  critique of human     thought  as  purely  mental  and
individual is now well established for embodied reality. But what happens in virtual worlds. Where the physical
world no longer grounds action and reflection? That is the question for this paper.

Constructing a Shared Virtual World
However, the problem of shared understanding rises again--and this time legitimately--within the context of
computer-supported     collaborative  learning  (CSCL).   That   is because  when    students  gather  in a CSCL     online
environment, they enter a virtual world, which is distinct from the world of physical co-presence. They leave the
world of nature, of physical embodiment, of face-to-face perception. They enter a world that they have not all
grown into together. But this does not mean that "shared understanding" is just a matter of overlapping opinions
of mental models for online groups either.

          In    the  Virtual   Math     Teams      (VMT)
Project,  we    have   been   studying   how     students
interact    in  a   particular   CSCL       environment
designed     to   support    online   discourse     about
mathematics.      In  this paper     we  will   illustrate
some   of   our findings   about     how interaction      in
the VMT environment addresses the challenge of
constructing    a   shared   virtual  world,    in which
small    groups     of  students     can    productively
engage in collaborative mathematics.
          This paper will present a case study of
Session 3 of Team C in the VMT Spring Fest
2006. Here, students aged 12-15 from different
schools in the US met online for four hour-long
sessions. Neither the students nor the researchers

did not engage with them in the mathematics. Between sessions, the researchers posted feedback in the shared
whiteboard of the environment. The VMT Project is described and discussed in (Stahl, 2009); its theoretical
motivation is presented in (Stahl, 2006). The VMT environment is shown in Figure 1. The complete chat log of
Session     3   of     Team    C     is  given      in    the    Appendix     of  the      online     version       of  this     paper

          In the next sections, we illustrate the following aspects of building shared understanding: (a) Asking
each   other   questions   is one    common     way    of resolving   or avoiding  troubles    of  understanding       and    aligning
perceptions. (b) Literally looking at the same aspect of something as someone else helps us to see what each
other means. (c) The co-constructed shared world has social and temporal as well as objective dimensions. (d)
This world grounds communicative, interpersonal, and task-related activities for online groups.

Questioning to Share Understanding
We have analyzed how questions posed in the VMT environment often work to initiate interactions that resolve
troubles of understanding and deepen shared understanding (Zhou, 2009; 2010; Zhou, Zemel & Stahl, 2008).
This   is in   contrast   to  the rationalist    assumption      that
questions are requests for propositional information. We

          In Log 3, the moderator, Nan, asks a question to make visible in the chat what members of the group
are doing. Qwertyuiop is busy constructing the requested grid in the whiteboard and the others are presumably
watching that drawing activity and waiting for its conclusion. The students do not seem to feel that there is a
problem    in  their   understanding     of   each    other's    activities. However,     due   to     the   nature     of     the virtual
environment--in which the attentiveness of participants is only visible through their chat and drawing actions--
Nan cannot know if everyone is engaged during this period of chat inaction. Her question makes visible to her
and to the students the fact that everyone is still engaged. The questioning may come as a minor interference in
their  group   interaction,  since   Nan's    questioning     positions her    as someone      outside   the    group         ("everyone"),
exerting authority by asking for an accounting, although it is intended to increase group shared understanding
("everyone know what other people are doing").

See What I Mean
Studies of the use of interactive whiteboards in face-to-face classrooms have shown that they can open up a
"shared   dynamic     dialogical   space"  (Kershner     et al., 2010)  as   a focal point     for collective       reasoning      and      co-
construction of knowledge. Similarly, in architectural design studios, presentation technologies mediate shared
ways of seeing from different perspectives (Lymer, Ivarsson & Lindwall, 2009) in order to establish shared
understanding among design students, their peers, and their critics. Clearly, a physical whiteboard that people
can gather around and gesture toward while discussing and interpreting visual and symbolic representations is
different from a virtual shared whiteboard in an environment like VMT.
          We have analyzed in some detail the intimate coordination of visual, narrative and symbolic activity
involving the shared whiteboard in VMT sessions
(Çakir, 2009; Çakir, Stahl & Zemel, 2010; Çakir,
Zemel & Stahl, 2009). Here, we want to bring out                 Log 4.

Qwertyuiop     poses    a  question   for  clarification    and  receives  an    affirmative,  but   minimal    response.  Jason,
unsatisfied with the response, escalates the clarification request by asking for help in seeing the diagram in the
whiteboard as an "hexagonal array," so he can see it as 137 sees it. Between Jason's request in line 709 and
acceptance     in line  710,   Qwertyuiop     and  137    work   together  to  add   lines outlining    a large  hexagon   in  the
triangular  array.     Demonstrating      his  ability  to   now     see hexagons,   Jason     thereupon    proceeds     with  the
mathematical work, which he had halted in the beginning of line 709 in order to keep the group aligned. Jason
tentatively  proposes     that every   hexagon  "has    at   least 6  triangles" and he    makes   this  visible to everyone   by
pointing to an illustrative small hexagon from the chat posting, using the VMT graphical pointing tool.
           In Log 5, 137 asks the group to share its knowledge about how to color lines in the VMT whiteboard.
Jason gives instructions for 137 to visually locate the appropriate icon in the VMT interface. Demonstrating this
new knowledge, 137 changes the colors of the six lines outlining the large hexagon, from black to blue, making
the outline stand out visually (see Figure 1). 137 thereby finally clarifies how to look at the array of lines as a
large  hexagon,    a task  that   is more  difficult   than  looking  at  the small  hexagon     that Jason  pointed   to. In this
excerpt, the group shares their working knowledge of their virtual world (the software functionality embedded
in it), incidentally to carrying out their task-oriented discourse within that world.
           In Log 6, Jason proposes a specific mathematical task for the group to undertake, producing a formula
for the number of triangles in an hexagonal array of any given side length. (As we shall see below, the group
uses   the term   "side length"    as the  measure     of  a geometric   pattern  at stage   n.) Qwertyuiop      responds  to this
proposal with the suggestion to "see" the hexagon (of any size) as a configuration of six triangular areas. (To see
what Qwertyuiop is suggesting, look at Figure 1; one of the six triangular areas of the large hexagonal array has
its "sticks" colored with thick lines. Looking at this one triangular area, you can see in rows successively further
from the center of the hexagon a sequence of one small triangle, then three triangles, then five triangles.)
           In line 723, 137 seeks confirmation that he is sharing Qwertyuiop's understanding of the suggestion.
After posting, "Like this?" with a reference back to Qwertyuiop's line 722, 137 draws three red lines through
the center of the large hexagon, dividing it visually into six triangular areas. Upon seeing the hexagon divided
up by 137's lines, Qwertyuiop and Jason both confirm the shared understanding. Now that they are confident
that they are all seeing the mathematical situation the same, namely as a set of six triangular sub-objects, the
group can continue its mathematical work. Jason draws the consequence from Qwertyuiop's suggestion that the
formula    for the  number     of small   triangles  in a  hexagon    will simply    be six  times   the  number  in  one  of  the
triangular areas of that hexagon, thereby subdividing the problem. 137 then notes that each of those triangular
areas has 1+3+5 small triangles, at least for the example hexagonal array that they are looking at. The fact that
the three   members     of  the   group  take  turns   making    the  consecutive   steps  of  the mathematical     deduction  is
significant; it demonstrates that they share a common understanding of the deduction and are building their
shared knowledge collaboratively.
           The observation, "Each one has 1+3+5 triangles," is a key move in deducing the sought equation. Note
that 137 did not simply say that each triangular area had nine small triangles. The posting used the symbolic
visual representation, "1+3+5." This shows a pattern of the addition of consecutive odd numbers, starting with
1.  This   pattern  is visible  in   the posting.   It indicates   that  137  is  seeing   the nine   triangles  as a  pattern of
consecutive odd numbers--and thereby suggests that the reader also see the nine triangles as such a pattern.
This is largely a visual accomplishment of the human visual system. People automatically see collections of
small numbers of objects as sets of that specific size (Lakoff & Núñez, 2000). For somewhat larger sets, young
children readily learn to count the number of objects. The team has constructed a graphical representation in
which all the members of the team can immediately see features of their mathematical object that are helpful to
their  mathematical     task.  The   team   is collaborating     within  a shared    virtual   world  in  which   they   have  co-
constructed visual, narrative, and symbolic objects in the chat and whiteboard areas. The team has achieved this
shared    vision  by enacting     practices specific    to math    as a  profession  for shaping     witnessed   events, such  as
invoking math terms and drawing each others' attention to relevant objects in the scene (Goodwin, 1994). They
have learned and taught each other how to work, discuss, and perceive as a group in this shared virtual world.

Dimensions of a Virtual World
There has not been much written about the constitution of the intersubjective world as the background of shared
understanding, particularly in the CSCL online context. There has not been much written about the constitution
of the intersubjective world as the background of shared understanding, particularly in the CSCL online context.
This   is largely  the  result  of   the dominance     of  the  cognitive  perspective,  which   is   primarily  concerned    with
mental    models   and  representations     of the  world;   this  rationalist view  reduces     the  shared world    to possible
similarities of individual mental representations. Within the VMT Project, we have analyzed the dimensions of
domain     content,  social interaction,   and  temporal     sequencing    in the co-construction     of  a virtual math   team's
world or joint problem space (Sarmiento & Stahl, 2008; Sarmiento-Klapper, 2009a; Sarmiento-Klapper, 2009b).
In this work, we have found the following conceptualizations to be suggestive: the joint problem space (Teasley
&   Roschelle,    1993)   and   the   indexical ground       of reference  of  domain    content   (Hanks,    1992);   the  social

           In previous sessions, the group has tried to derive formulae for the number of two-dimensional objects
(small  squares     or   small   triangles)  in  a growing       pattern of these  objects,   as    well  as   the  number        of    one-
dimensional sides, edges or "sticks" needed to construct these objects. A major concern in counting the number
of sides is the issue of "overlap." In a stair-step two-dimensional pattern (like the 2-D version of the stair-step
pyramid in the lower right section of Figure 1), one cannot simply multiply the number of squares by 4 to get
the number of sides because many of the sides are common to two squares. In Session 1, Team C had seen that
in moving from one stage to the next of the stair-step pattern most new squares only required two new sides.
           In  Log     7,   Qwertyuiop      moves     on   from    the
derivation    of  the    number     of triangles   to   that  of   the

each session, the teams had posted their findings to a wiki shared by all the participants in the VMT Spring Fest
2006. During their Session 3, Team B had looked at Team C's work on a pattern they had invented: a diamond
variation on the stair-step pattern. In their wiki posting, Team C had used their term, "side length." Because
members of Team B did not share Teams C's understanding of this term, they were confused by the equation
and discussion that Team C posted to the wiki. Team B's question sought to establish shared understanding
across the teams, to build a community-wide shared world. As it turned out, Team C had never completed work
on the formula for the number of sides in a diamond pattern and Team B eventually discovered and reported the
error in Team C's wiki posting, demonstrating the importance of community-wide shared understanding.

Grounding Group Cognition
CSCL is about meaning making (Stahl, Koschmann & Suthers, 2006). At its theoretical core are questions about
how students collaborating online co-construct and understand meaning. In this paper, we conceptualize this
issue  in terms    of  online  groups,  such   as  virtual
math teams, building a shared meaningful world in
which to view and work on mathematical objects.               Log 10.

idea   of a   fourth   dimension   and    was    eager   to
explore it. However, 137 had not been so exposed.
They did not share the necessary background for working on Qwertyuiop's proposal. This shows that tasks for
student   groups,  even    tasks  they  set  for  themselves,  need  to    be   within  a    shared       group  zone      of   proximal

individually,  they    were   able to  solve   it  collectively,  with    enough  shared       understanding        that   they       could
successfully   work    together.  Their   three-dimensional    pyramid     turned  out   to    be  quite     difficult     for  them     to
visualize in a shared way. Their diamond pattern seemed to be easy for them, although they forgot to work on
some of it and posted an erroneous formula. The hexagonal array required them to develop their skills in a
number of areas, but they solved it nicely. However, the hyper-cube exceeded at least 137's ability (or desire) to
participate.
          Rationalist philosophy reduces the complexity of social human existence to a logical, immaterial mind
that thinks about things by representing them internally. It confuses the mind with the brain and conflates the
two. It assumes that someone thinking about a hexagon or working on a math problem involving a hexagon
must primarily be representing the hexagon in some kind of mental model. But one of the major discoveries of
phenomenology (Husserl, 1936/1989) was that intentionality is always the intentionality of some object and that
cognition    takes place   as a  "being-with"    that object, not as a    mental  act   of   some  transcendental          ego.      As  an
example, we have seen that the members of Team C are focused on the graphical image of the hexagon in their
virtual world on their computer screens. They reference this image and transform it with additional lines, colors,
and pointers. They chat about this image, not about some personal mental representations. They work to get
each other to see that image in the same way that they see it. This "seeing" is to be taken quite literally. Their
eyes directly perceive the image. They perceive the image in a particular way (which may change and which
they may have to learn to see). "Seeing" is not a metaphor to describe some kind of subjective mental process
that is inaccessible    to others, but  a   form   of contact with the    object  in   the   world.    We     may   say    that      shared
understanding is a matter of the group members being-there-together at the graphical image in the whiteboard.

         Being-there-together is a possible mode of existence of the online group. The "there" where they are is
a multi-dimensional virtual world. This world was partially already there when they first logged in. It included
the computer hardware and software. It included the VMT Spring Fest as an organized social institution. As they
started to interact,  the students    fleshed   out the world,  building    social relationships,  enacting  the   available
technology, interpreting the task instructions, and proposing steps to take together. Over time, they constructed a
rich world, furnished with mathematical objects largely of their own making and supporting group practices that
they had introduced individually but which they had experienced as a group.
         Being-there-together     in  their virtual world  with  their  shared   understanding  of many     of  this world's
features, the group was able to accomplish mathematical feats that none of them could have done alone. Each
individual  in the    group shared    an understanding     of their group   work   at least  enough  to make    productive
contributions that reflected a grasp of what the group was doing. Their group accomplishments were achieved
through  group   processes    of visualization,   discourse,  and   deduction.   They  were    accomplishments     of group
cognition, which does not refer to anything mystical, but to the achievements of group interaction. The group
cognition was possible because of, and only on the basis of, the shared understanding of the common virtual
world. Shared understanding is not a matter of similar mental models, but of experiencing a shared world.
         Of course, there are limits to group cognition, just as there are limits to individual cognition. We saw
that   Team  C   could    not  understand     Qwertyuiop's     ideas  about   the  fourth    dimension.   Without     shared
understanding about this, the group could not engage in discourse on that topic. Group cognition can exceed the
limits of the individual cognition of the group members, but only by a certain amount. The individuals must be
able to stretch  their own    existing understanding    under   the guidance    of their peers, with  the   aid of   physical
representations, tools, concepts, scaffolds, and similar artifacts, whose use is within their grasp--within their
zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1930/1978). We have seen that Team C was able to solve a complex
mathematical   problem    that   they set   for themselves    involving   a hexagonal    array by building   up  gradually,
systematically, and in close coordination a meaningful virtual world.
         An analysis of the log of the interaction in our case study has demonstrated much about the team's
group   cognition. Their    group  work     proceeded   by  contributions    from  different   individuals, with   everyone
contributing in important ways. Their questions showed that their individual cognition was initially inadequate
to many steps in the work; but their questions also served to expand the shared understanding and to ensure that
each member shared an understanding of each step. Because, the students demonstrated an understanding of the
group work through their successive contributions, we can see not only that individual learning took place, but
we can analyze the interactional processes through which it took place through detailed analysis of their chat
and drawing actions.
         As Vygotsky argued, not only does group cognition lead individual cognition by several years, but
individual cognition itself develops originally as a spin-off of group cognition. Individuals can learn on their
own, but the cognitive and practical skills that they use to do so are generally learned through interaction with
others and in small groups. This is a powerful argument for the use of CSCL in education. It is incumbent upon
CSCL    research to   further analyze    the processes  by    which  this takes  place in the  co-construction   of   shared
understanding    within   co-experienced     virtual  worlds.   As   we     have   seen, participants   in  CSCL      virtual
environments co-construct worlds to ground their interactions. These virtual worlds exploit meaning-making,
perceptual and referential practices learned in the physical social world.
