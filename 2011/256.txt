         How a Virtual Math Team Structured its Problem Solving
                 Gerry Stahl, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA, Gerry@GerryStahl.net

         Abstract:    To  develop  a theory   of small-group interaction   in  CSCL   settings, we need   an
         approach to analyzing the structure of computer-mediated discourse. Conversation Analysis
         examines informal face-to-face talk in terms of a fine structure of adjacency pairs, but needs to
         be adapted to online textual interaction and extended to analyze longer sequences built on
         adjacency pairs. This paper presents a case study of students solving a math problem in an
         online chat environment. It shows that their problem-solving discourse consists of a sequence
         of exchanges,    each built on  a base   adjacency pair   and each   contributing a move   in  their
         collaborative problem-solving process.

Structuring Group Cognition at Multiple Levels
A  year  ago  in my    opening keynote   talk (Stahl, 2009a)    at the International  Conference   of  Computers    in
Education   (ICCE  2009)   in Hong   Kong,  I claimed that  the discourse   of group  cognition  (Stahl, 2006)  has a
hierarchical structure, typically including the following levels, as illustrated with a particular case study from the
Virtual Math Teams (VMT) Project (Stahl, 2009c):
a.  Group event: E.g., Team B's participation in the VMT Spring Fest 2006.
b.  Temporal session: Session 4 of Team B on the afternoon of May 18, 2006.
c.  Conversational topic: Determining the number of sticks in a diamond pattern (lines 1734 to 1833 of the
    chat log of Session 4).
d.  Discourse move: A stage in the sequence of moves to accomplish discussing the conversational topic (e.g.,
    lines 1767-1770--see Logs 1-10 below).
e.  Adjacency pair: The base interaction involving two or three utterances, which drives a discourse move
    (lines 1767 and 1769).
f.  Textual utterance: A text chat posting by an individual participant, which may contribute to an adjacency
    pair (line 1767).
g.  Indexical reference: An element of a textual utterance that points to a relevant resource. In VMT, actions
    and  objects  in  the shared   whiteboard are  often referenced  in   the chat. Mathematical   content  and other
    resources from the joint problem space and from shared past experience are also brought into the discourse
    by explicit or implicit reference in a chat posting.
          The multi-layered    structure corresponds  to the multiplicity   of constraints imposed  on   small-group
discourse--from the character of the life-world and of culture (which mediate macro-structure) to the semantic,
syntactic and pragmatic rules of language (which govern the fine structure of utterances). A theory of group
cognition must concern itself primarily with the analysis of mid-level phenomena--such as how small groups
accomplish collaborative problem solving and other conversational topics.
         The  study    of  mid-level  group-cognition    phenomena     is a   realm  of  analysis  that  is  currently
underdeveloped in the research literature. For instance, many CSCL studies focus on coding individual (micro-
level) utterances or assessing learning outcomes (macro-level), without analyzing the group processes (mid-
level). Similarly,    Conversation Analysis   (CA)  centers on  micro-level    adjacency pairs   while  socio-cultural
Discourse Analysis is concerned with macro-level identity and power, without characterizing the interaction
patterns that build such macro phenomena out of microelements. Understanding these mid-level phenomena is
crucial to analyzing collaborative learning, for it is this level that largely mediates between the interpretations of
individuals and the socio-cultural factors of communities.
         The analysis in this paper illustrates the applicability of the notion of a `long sequence' as vaguely
suggested by both Sacks (1962/1995, II p. 354) and Schegloff (2007, pp. 12, 213). A longer sequence consists of
a coherent series of shorter sequences built on adjacency pairs. This multi-layered sequential structure will be
adapted in this paper from the informal face-to-face talk-in-interaction of CA to the essentially different, but
analogous, context of groupware-supported communication and group cognition, such as the text chat of VMT. I
will show how a small group of students collaborating online constructed a coherent long sequence, through
which they solved the problem that they had posed for themselves. Methodologically, it is important to note that
the definition of the long sequence--like that of the other levels of structure listed above--is oriented to by the
discourse of the students and is not simply a construct of the researcher.

An Analytic Method
Recently, I have been trying to apply the CA perspective and techniques in a systematic way to the analysis of
VMT chat logs. Schegloff's (2007) book on Sequence Organization in Interaction represents the culmination of
decades of CA analysis. As indicated by its subtitle, it provides a useful primer in CA. My goal is to transform
CA to apply to online chat and to extend it to analyze the larger scale interactions of group cognition.

          Schegloff's presentation makes clear the central
role of the adjacency pair as the primary unit of sequence
construction  according       to  CA.  An   adjacency   pair  is
composed   of two     conversational    speaking  turns by two
different  people,  with    an interactional   order, such as a
question   followed   by    an   answer  to the  question. The
simple  two-turn   pair   can    be  extended  with   secondary
adjacency  pairs   that   precede,   are inserted  between    or
follow  up   on   the    base  pair, recursively.  This  yields
"extensive   stretches   of talk  which  nonetheless   must  be
understood as built on the armature of a single adjacency
pair,  and   therefore      needing   to    be  understood    as
extensions of it" (p. 12).
          These   "extensive      stretches of  talk"  are still
focused on a single interaction of meaning making, and
not a larger cognitive achievement like problem solving.
However,     both  Sacks      and   Schegloff   provide  vague    Figure 1. VMT interface with stair-step pattern of
suggestions about the analysis of longer sequences. These         horizontal and vertical sticks.
suggestions have not been extensively developed within CA. This paper is an attempt to explore them in an
online text-chat context.
          As I have frequently argued (e.g., Stahl, 2006; 2009c; Stahl, Koschmann & Suthers, 2006), I believe
that adapting CA to computer-mediated communication offers the best prospects for analysis of interaction in
groupware--i.e., for a theory of small groups appropriate to CSCL. I designed and directed the Virtual Math
Teams (VMT) Project from 2003 to the present in order to produce a corpus of data that could be analyzed in as
much detail as needed to determine the structure of group cognition, that is, of collaborative knowledge building
through interaction at the group unit of analysis.
          In looking at the VMT data corpus, the VMT research team has clearly seen the differences between
online text chat and verbal conversation. The system of turn taking so important in CA (Sacks, Schegloff &
Jefferson, 1974) does not apply in chat. Instead, chat participants engage in `reading's work' (Zemel & Çakir,
2009),  in which   "readers    connect   objects through   reading's work  to create a  `thread   of meaning' from the
various postings available for inspection" (p. 274f). The first and second parts of an adjacency pair may no
longer be literally temporally adjacent to each other, but they still occur as mutually relevant, anticipatory and
responsive. The task of reading's work--for both participants and analysts--is to reconstruct the threading of
the adjacency pair response structure (Stahl, 2009b).
          We have tried to explore the larger sequential structure of problem-solving chat by using the CA notion
of openings and closings (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973). VMT researchers looked at several math chats from 2004,
which used a simple chat tool from AOL. We coded and statistically analyzed the fine-structure threading of
adjacency pairs (Çakir, Xhafa & Zhou, 2009). In addition, we defined long sequences based on when opening
and closing adjacency pairs achieved changes in topic (Zemel, Xhafa & Çakir, 2009). These long sequences
were graphed to show their roles in constituting the chat sessions, but their internal sequential structures were
not investigated.
          My colleagues and I have subsequently conducted numerous case studies from the VMT corpus. We
have been particularly drawn to the records of Team B and Team C in the VMT Spring Fest 2006. These were
particularly rich sessions of online mathematical knowledge building because these teams of students met for
over four hours together and engaged in detailed explorations of interesting mathematical phenomena. However,
partially because of the richness of the interactions, it was often hard for analysts to determine a clear structure
to the student interactions. Despite access to everything that the students knew about each other and about the
group  interaction,   it proved   hard  to  unambiguously   specify  the group-cognition processes    at work (Medina,
Suthers & Vatrapu, 2009; Stahl, 2009b; Stahl, Zemel & Koschmann, 2009).
          Therefore, in the following case study, I have selected a segment of Team B's final session, in which
the structure of the interaction seems to be clearer. The interaction is simpler than in earlier segments partially
because two of the four people in the chat room leave. Thus, the response structure is more direct and less
interrupted. In addition,     the students  have  already  been  together for over four hours,    so they know how   to
interact in the software environment and with each other. Furthermore, they set themselves a straightforward
and well-understood mathematical task. The analysis of this relatively simple segment of VMT interaction can
then provide a model for subsequently looking at other data and seeing if it may follow similar patterns.

The Case Study
Three anonymous students (Aznx, Bwang, Quicksilver) from US high schools met online as Team B of the
VMT Spring Fest 2006 contest to compete to be "the most collaborative virtual math team." They met for four

hour-long sessions during a two-week period in May 2006. A facilitator (Gerry) was present in the chat room to
help with technical issues, but not to instruct in mathematics.
         In   their first session, they    solved       a given problem,    finding   a  mathematical     formula  for  the growth
pattern of the number of squares and the number of sticks making up a stair-step arrangement of squares. They
determined the number of sticks by drawing just the horizontal sticks together and then just the vertical ones
(see Figure 1). They noticed that both the horizontals and the verticals formed the same pattern of 1 + 2 + 3 + ...
+ n + n sticks at the nth stage of the growth pattern. They then applied the well-known Gaussian formula for the
sum  of consecutive    integers,   added    the  extra     n, and  multiplied    by 2 to   account   for  both the  horizontal  and
vertical sets of sticks.
         In the second session, they explored problems that they came up with themselves, related to the stair-
step problem,   including    3-D  pyramids.      Here     they  ran  into problems    drawing     and analyzing    3-D  structures.
However, they managed to approach the problem from a number of perspectives, including decomposing the
structure into horizontal and vertical sticks. In the third session, Team B was attracted to a diamond-shaped
variation of the stair-step figure, as explored by Team C in the Spring Fest. They tried to understand how the
other team had derived its solution. They counted the number of squares by simplifying the problem through
filling in the four corners surrounding the diamond to make a large square; the corners turned out to follow the
stair-step pattern  from   their  original    problem.      In  the  fourth session,    they discovered    that  the  other   team's
formula for the number of sticks was wrong. In the following, we join them an hour and 17 minutes into the
fourth session, when one of the students as well as the facilitator had to leave.

Problem-Solving Moves
In this section of the paper, the interaction is analyzed as a sequence of moves in the problem-solving interaction
between Bwang and Aznx, the two remaining students. Each move is seen to include a base adjacency pair (in
bold   face), which   provides    the central    interaction    of  the move     and accomplishes     the  focal problem-solving
activity. The captions of log segments indicate the aim of the move, according to the analysis.
         In line 1734 (see Log 1), Bwang states that the team is close to being able to solve the problem of the
                                                                            number of sticks in the nth stage of the diamond

this is the next step by trying to produce the equation. In line 1774, Bwang asks Aznx to state the equation and
Aznx expresses difficulty in formulating an adequate and accountable answer. After a half minute of silence
with still no formulation from Aznx, the facilitator suggests that Aznx and Bwang might want to wait until a
future time when the whole group can work together to finish the problem. The facilitator then says goodbye
and leaves  the     room.     After more    than        a minute since       Aznx posted   anything,    Bwang      starts to preface      the
presentation of his own formulation. Eventually, Aznx joins back in. Simultaneously, Aznx and Bwang post
their formulae. For Aznx, it is either n2 or              (n/2)2. For Bwang, it is 2n(n/2). Aznx has not given any indication of
how he got his proposed formulae. Bwang's formula suggests the use of Gauss' summation, which the students
have used repeatedly in the past. According to this summation of an arithmetic sequence of integers, the result is
the sum of the first and last member of the sequence times half the number of members. For a sequence of n
members, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1), the sum would be [1 + (2n-1)]*(n/2). Adding the 1 and the -1, yields Bwang's

The Sequence of Pairs
Within each of the preceding log segments we have identified a base adjacency pair by means of which the work
of a specific move in the problem-solving effort of the small group is interactively accomplished. In most cases,
a question is posed and a response is then given to it. As Schegloff (2007) argues, an adjacency pair is itself a
sequence. It embodies a temporal structure, with the first element of the pair projecting the opportunity and
expectation of a response in the interactional immediate future. The second element constitutes an uptake of a
first element that it implicitly references as in the interactional immediate past (Suthers et al., 2010). In engaging
in the exchange of an adjacency pair, the participants in the interaction effectively co-construct an elementary
temporal structure within which future and past events can be located and referenced.
          In talk-in-interaction, as analyzed by CA, the immediacy of response is intimately related to the turn-
taking structure of vocal conversation (Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974). As discussed above, the completion
of the  adjacency     pair can  be postponed  by    insertion sequences,    such as  repairs of misunderstandings   or
clarification exchanges.    The  base  adjacency  pair can    also be  preceded  by  introductory exchanges, such   as
announcements of what is coming, or succeeded by follow-up exchanges or confirmations.
          In chat-in-interaction, as seen in the preceding log extracts, adjacency pairs can in addition be delayed
by a   more complicated     response  structure, in which multiple    participants can be typing  simultaneously   and
postings do not always directly follow the message to which they are responding. Thus, in Log 1, Quicksilver or
Gerry can be initiating other topics in the midst of an interaction between Aznx and Bwang. Also, Aznx and
Bwang can be typing to each other simultaneously as in Log 6, particularly if there has been an extended period
of inactivity. This often makes textual chat harder to follow and to analyze than verbal conversation.
          Nevertheless, it is generally possible to identify base adjacency pairs carrying the discourse along. In
the previous section, we identified ten such pairs. The discourse moves in the log segments (each including one
of these base adjacency pairs) formed a problem-solving sequence:
·   Log 1. Open the topic                                          ·   Log 6. Negotiate the solution
·   Log 2. Decide to start                                         ·   Log 7. Check cases
·   Log 3. Pick an approach                                        ·   Log 8. Celebrate the solution
·   Log 4. Identify the pattern                                    ·   Log 9. Present a formal solution
·   Log 5. Seek the equation                                       ·   Log 10. Close the topic
          The integrity of each of the ten moves is constructed by the discourse of the participants. Each move
contains its single adjacency pair, which drives the interaction. In addition, there may be several utterances of
secondary structural importance, which introduce, interrupt or extend the base pair; there may also be some
peripheral utterances by other participants.
The Group Perspective
The analysis of this paper is an attempt to make explicit the structure of adjacency pairs and a problem-solving
longer sequence that is experienced by the participants and is implicit in the formulation of their contributions to
the discourse. This is in contrast to analytic approaches that to some degree impose a set of coding categories
based on the analyst's research interests or on an a priori theoretical framework.
          Lines 1795 and 1796, for instance, show the power for the participants of the adjacency pairings. Here,
Aznx has addressed a mathematical proposal to Bwang: "If you simplify yours [expression], it is n2." After 24
seconds of inaction, Aznx cannot understand why Bwang has not replied, expressing agreement or disagreement
with the first part of the proposal, for which Aznx expects a response. Because it is not a preferred move at this
point for Aznx to reprimand Bwang for not responding, Aznx inquires if Bwang has disappeared, perhaps due to
a technical software problem, which would not be anyone's fault. Two seconds later, we see that Bwang was
typing a more involved response that implicitly accepted Aznx' proposal. Bwang then immediately explicitly
accepts the proposal in line 1798, allowing Aznx to continue with the start of a new move with line 1802. Here
we see Aznx and Bwang clearly orienting to the adjacency-pair structure of their discourse, in terms of their
expectations and responses.
          Aznx and Bwang co-constructed the longer (ten-move) problem-solving sequence by engaging in the
successive exchange of adjacency pairs. Sometimes one of the students would initiate a pair, sometimes the
other. As soon as they completed one pair, they would start the next. This longer sequence also has a temporal
structure. It is grounded    in their present situation, trying to   find a  formula for the  number  of sticks in the
diamond    figure. It makes    considerable use  of resources  from    their shared (co-experienced)  past during  the
previous four hours of online sessions. It is strongly driven forward into the future by the practices they have
learned for engaging in problem solving, culminating teleologically in the presentation of a solution.
          The problem-solving sequence analyzed in this paper--covering 100 lines of chat during 10 minutes--
is not selected arbitrarily or imposed in accordance with criteria external to the interaction, but is grounded in

the discourse as structured by the participants. The excerpted sequence is defined as a coherent conversational
topic by the discourse of Aznx and Bwang. They open this topic with their interaction in Log 1 and they close it
with the discourse move in Log 10 (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973).
         In this paper, I have shown how the group constructs its mid-level problem-solving structure through a
longer  sequence   built   on   micro-level adjacency   pairs  and   contributing   significantly   to  their macro-level
collaborative learning, knowledge building and group cognition. Reviewing the hierarchy of levels introduced
previously,  it is now   clear  that  each level  can be   analyzed  as oriented  to by  the   group   discourse   and the
contributions to it by individual members:
a.  Group event: The group members log in to the event and comment explicitly on its goals, characteristics
    and duration as an event in which they are participating.
b.  Temporal session: Participants start each session with greetings and end with good byes.
c.  Conversational topic: The group explicitly opened and closed the topic analyzed in this case study.
d.  Discourse move: Each move was executed with a single adjacency pair.
e.  Adjacency pair: An adjacency pair includes an elicitation        and a response by each participant.
f.  Textual utterance: A text chat posting is defined by a participant actively typing and sending a message.
g.  Indexical reference: A reference is made by a word choice or graphical action by a participant.
         This case study provides an unusually clear and simple example of problem solving in a virtual math
team. In earlier sessions, the students encountered many difficulties, although they also achieved a variety of
successes and learned much about both collaboration and mathematics. At the beginning of their first session,
they did not know how to behave together and showed rather poor collaboration skills. Bwang said very little in
English, often simply producing drawings or mathematical expressions. Aznx, at the other extreme, tried hard to
engage the others, but seemed to have a weak mathematical understanding of what the others were discussing.
At various points in the sessions, misunderstandings caused major detours and breakdowns in the group work.
Moreover, from an analyst's perspective the interaction was often almost impossible to parse (Stahl, 2009b). By
contrast, in the final conversational topic, which is here reviewed, the interaction is focused on two participants;
they work well together; they seem to follow each other well; and their work goes quite smoothly. The structure
of the interaction is also relatively easy to follow.
         It  seems    that  Aznx   and  Bwang    have  substantially  increased   their skills   in online    collaborative
mathematics.    The   level of  their  excitement--especially   in  the segment   of Log    8--shows     they  are  highly
motivated. Log 10 indicates that they would like to continue this kind of experience in the future.

The Structure of Group Cognition
The analysis of the case study in this paper provides a first analysis of the long-sequence-of-moves structure of
collaborative mathematical problem solving in a virtual math team. This is a paradigmatic example of group
cognition. The small group--here reduced to a dyad--solves a math problem whose solution had until then
eluded them (and had escaped Team C as well).
         The students accomplish the problem solving by successively completing a sequence of ten moves.
Each of the moves seems almost trivial, but each takes place through an interaction that involves both students
in its achievement. The moves are commonplace, taken-for-granted practices of mathematical problem solving.
They are familiar from individual and classroom problem solving in algebra classrooms. They have also been
encountered   repeatedly    by  Team   B in their  previous   four hours   of collaborative  problem    solving (Medina,
Suthers & Vatrapu, 2009). It is this sequence of moves that accomplishes the problem solving. The sequence has
an inner logic, with each move requiring the previous moves to have already been successfully completed and
each move preparing the way for the following ones.
         The common assumption about mathematical problem solving is that math facts and manipulations are
what   are most  important.    In  our analysis  of problem   solving   in a  group  context,  math    content  is simply,
unproblematically     included  in individual    postings. In fact, more   often  than  not,  it is implicitly  used   and
understood "between the lines" of the text chat. Of course, this is only possible because the group had already
co-constructed a `joint problem space' (Kershner et al., 2010; Medina, Suthers & Vatrapu, 2009; Sarmiento &
Stahl, 2008; Teasley & Roschelle, 1993) that included this math content as already meaningful for the group.
Rather,  the important     aspects of  discourse  engaged   in collaborative   math  problem     solving  are  matters  of
coordination,   communication,     explanation,  decision  making   and  perspective    shifting (e.g., moving     between
visual, verbal and symbolic modes (Çakir, Zemel & Stahl, 2009)). To some extent, these are interactional moves
required by most group activities; to some extent, these are adapted to the nature of mathematical discourse.
         In  conclusion,    the group-cognitive   achievement   of  the  solution to   the  group's    final problem   was
accomplished by a sequence of moves. Each move was mundane when considered by itself. The moves and
their  sequencing   were    common     practices of mathematical    problem    solving. Each     move   was   interactively
achieved through the exchange of base adjacency pairs situated in the ongoing discourse. The problem solving
was an act of group cognition structured as a sequence of these interactive moves.

         Perhaps this case study can serve as an unusually clear and simple model of the structure of group
cognition in mathematical problem solving by a virtual math team. It shows the group cognition taking place
through the co-construction of a temporal sequence of problem-solving moves in the group discourse. While the
fine structure adheres     to the  adjacency-pair   system  of interactional   exchange,  the larger problem-solving
structure builds on these elements through a sequence defined by the topical moves of mathematical deduction.
