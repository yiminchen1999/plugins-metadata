                Abstract: Research-based calls for science education reform emphasize that, for inquiry and
                deep learning to occur, teachers must attend to the substance of students' ideas, which must
                play a prominent role in class.   Using classroom video and teacher interviews, we illustrate
                two different  ways   of attending  to students' ideas,  both of    which sustain  students'   sense-
                making.  These two different kinds of attention reflect different, perhaps tacit, answers to the
                question, "What kind of activity is this?"

      Introduction
                Constructivist views of learning support the claim that student ideas need to play a prominent role in
       science classes if students are to develop a deep understanding of science (Driver, Guesne, Tiberghien, 1985).
       Ideally, an "authentic dialogue about scientific ideas and processes...occurs between students and teachers and
       among students themselves" (Deneroff, Sandoval, Franke, 2002).           But what does it look like, exactly, when
       teachers "display  and  demand    respect  for  the diverse   ideas,  skills and   experiences  of  all students,"     by
       "(f)ocusing on student understanding and use of scientific knowledge, ideas, and inquiry process skills, as the
       National Research Council (1996) report suggests?        In this  paper,  we  illustrate two  distinct answers     to this
       question -- two different ways in which teachers can frame their classroom interactions (Tannen, 1993), both of
       which demonstrably     involve attending  to the substance    of students ideas  and both   of which   help to    sustain
       students' sense-making.    Studying   the different ways    a teacher  may   attend to   students' ideas  will help    us
       develop more nuanced understandings of teachers' practices and their influence on students' learning (see Lau,
       Elby & Hammer, in preparation), all of which have implications for teacher education.

      Two ways of attending to the substance of students' ideas
                The  teachers in this study, Dave   Hovan   and  Joanna   Myeson,   were  part  of a  three-year research    and
        professional development project focused on responsive teaching in science. Lau regularly taped the teachers' classes.
        For the two classroom episodes discussed below, right after the class, Lau conducted an open-ended interview to
        capture the teacher's initial impressions of how the class went and what he or she noticed.       Later, Lau used the
        classroom video to conduct video-stimulated recall interviews with the teacher. Although stimulated recall involves
        more reconstructing than direct remembering, our independent analysis of the teacher's classroom behaviors in these
        two episodes meshed with the teachers' recollections. We lack space here to argue in detail that, in each episode, the
        teacher was indeed attending to the substance of students' ideas and students were engaged in sense-making.          We
        hope to show, however, that the teachers were paying attention and framing their interactions in different ways.

       Dave's framing: exploring student ideas
                In this brief snippet from a longer interaction, a student named "George" is discussing his thoughts
       about whether air resistance helps to explain why a bowling ball and a small rock fall down at the same rate.

        53. George:       If there wasn't no air the ball would be      64. Dave:          Number one, it doesn't matter,
            coming down very very slow.                                     any height.
        54. Dave:         If there was no air?                          65. George:        I mean, if you drop this from a
        55. George:       Yeah.                                             certain height, it wouldn't...hit the ground.
        56. Dave:         So you're saying it would come down           66. Dave:          Not at the same time?
            slower if there was no air.                                 67. George:        Nah.
        57. George:       See like this (holds a book up and            68. Dave:          (pause) So are you saying the
            moves it down slowly) very slow. Like this, very                higher up that you drop something, like, the
            slow, steady, because there isn't any air.                      less likely they are gonna hit the ground at
        58. Dave:         So you're saying air makes things fall            the same time?
            faster.                                                     69. George:        Yup.
        59. George:       Yeah. (turns to write on worksheet)           70. Dave:          Okay why?
        60. Dave:         Okay.                                         71. George:        Because its heavier.  Say  look,
        61. George:       (8 second pause, writing) How high is             say like, if I got, if I stand on top of this
            this thing? Like if you dropped it, how high is it?             (slaps the top of the lab bench), right, and
        62. Dave:         For which one.                                    [we drop?] this (holds up a book and then a
        63. George:       For number one.                                   binder)...the binder's gonna drop first.

3-0
         From the classroom and interview data, we see evidence that Dave is focused on helping his student
articulate and explore that student's idea, independent of correctness.          He paraphrases and reflects back what
George says (lines 54, 56, 66), asks about implications of George's ideas (58 and 68), and asks for a rationale
(70). This fits in with his goals for the lesson (from interview data) of helping students explore their ideas as
well as helping them develop their reasoning skills and eliciting misconceptions to be addressed during later
instruction. We argue that Dave was able to maintain his attention in this way because of contextual cues in his
interaction with George that supported this way of framing the activity.         For example, George typically responds
to Dave with statements about his ideas.

Joanna's framing: learning about the mechanism with her students
         In the snippet below, students in Joanna's class discuss whether the melted water on the surface of ice
aided or hindered an object sliding on the ice.

 24.  Abe:         It--the reason why it's slippery           27.   Joanna:      Oh, so you're kind of thinking like
      on ice is cause there's a little water. If you                (Melissa: I don't know)...like what would be an
      have ice, with no water, with no melted water,                example of that?
      then you'll probably [wouldn't slip on it].             28.   Melissa:     Umm...I'm not sure.  (multiple
 25.  Joanna:      So you think that the melted--                   student voices) Like a puddle?
      the little--(draws on the board) you're                 29.   Joanna:      Like a puddle?  How would a puddle
      basically saying here's our ice and that there's              slow it down--like, what do you mean?    Like
      like a little, little, little, tiny thing of water            what's an example of that?
      right there and that's what makes it super              30.   Tiffany:     Going into the water, you know, just
      slippery. (Abe: Yeah) Is what you're saying.                  like-
      So someone who thinks that it makes it, slows           31.   Joanna:      Like if something is kind of like­
      it down, tell me why you think it slows it              32.   Rhonda:      Well if you're doing a marble across
      down, cause that's our counter argument,                      a table or something it would probably go slower
      right? So, so why do you think Melissa?                       in the water cause it has more stuff that it's going
 26.  Melissa:     Well I'm not sure, but like,                     through.
      maybe if it's like water then it's like just more       33.   Joanna:      So it's kind of going deeper in the
      stuff to go over.                                             water right? So as it rolls in, it's actually sinking
                                                                    in and eventually the water is stopping it....

         Joanna's attention and responses have a different flavor from Dave's.              Instead of reflecting back or
drawing out Abe's idea with a follow-up, she adds onto his idea (line 25): there's like a little, little, little tiny"
amount of melted water. In lines 27 and 29, she asks for clarification because she does not yet understand the
student's idea (according to her interview recollections).       Once she "gets" what Melissa is saying, she interrupts
another student (30-31) and adds onto and transforms Melissa and Rhonda's explanation; the idea of going
"deeper" into the water and "sinking in" is not explicit in what Rhonda or Melissa say.           This analysis, analyses
of other episodes  in   this class, and Joanna'   interview      comments    point toward   the following interpretation:
Unlike Dave, who was engaged in the elicitation of ideas about which he already had a firm understanding,
Joanna is engaged with the students in trying to figure out something she had not previously figured out: why
water on the ice might slow something down instead of helping it slide.              Despite these differences between
Dave's  and  Joanna's   classroom   interactions, the      students in  both cases engage   in sense-making, which    was
supported in both cases by the teacher's attention to their ideas; see Lau (in preparation) for full analysis.
         In summary, there is more than one way of following the exhortation to attend to the substance of
student ideas  and make   them  a   central part  of     science class.   Teacher education that privileges one type of
interaction could do harm, e.g., by telling Joanna to stop interrupting and stop bringing her own ideas into the
discussion. As this snippet may illustrate, if students interpret these "bad" elicitation moves as the teacher's
taking their ideas seriously enough to build them into her evolving understanding and explanations, their sense-
making may be supported rather than shut down.             Since "good" or "bad" may depend on such interpretations,
more research should focus on how teachers and students frame the teacher's attention to students' ideas.
