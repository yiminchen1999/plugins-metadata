                Abstract:     A  weakness    inherent    in   science  education   has been    (and  remains)  its   emphasis
                principally on the teaching of scientific knowledge, i.e. knowledge of the object (or the observed).
                Little attention   has   been   directed   to the  teaching   of   people knowledge    about   scientists, i.e.
                knowledge of the subject (or the observer) who creates knowledge. This study explores the nature
                of this people     knowledge    and  its possible  effects on   science   learning. There  are two   types  of
                people knowledge identified through this study: breadth-oriented people knowledge (BPK) and
                depth-oriented people knowledge (DPK). BPK profiles scientists' scientific achievements across
                life whereas DPK describes scientists' intellectual struggle in relation to their theory building. The
                findings indicate that the two types of people knowledge are fundamentally different in nature and
                it is only DPK that is beneficial to science learning (e.g., deepening students' understanding of
                scientific theories and making science learning environments more humanly interesting).

       Overview
                   Scientific  knowledge     organizations    in science  curricula   are person-neutral   (AAAS,     1993;   Hodson,
         1998; NRC, 1996). As reflected in science textbooks, a major knowledge source in science learning (Memory &
         Uhlhorn,  1991),     scientific knowledge      is normally    organized   around  natural   objects  (e.g., scientific  facts,
         concepts, and     theories). Rarely  seen   in  any  science   textbooks  is  knowledge    organized  around     people (e.g.,
         scientists' intellectual struggle with theory building) (Souque, 1987; Hodson, 1998). The emphasis on object-
         oriented knowledge, in part, is because helping students acquire objective knowledge of nature is a central goal
         in  science education     (AAAS,    1993;   NRC,     1996).   Accordingly,   students' cognitive    learning  experience    in
         science becomes highly person-irrelevant. Some critics, however, see this kind of dualism as a severe flaw in
         science. For example, Snow (1965) described the distinctness between science and humanities as a gap between
         "two cultures" and predicted such distinctive cultures would bring more harm than good to mankind. Jenkins
         (1989)  deemed    it as a  weakness    as   science  does not   tell people  its humanistic  components.     To   avoid  such
         dualism   and  to increase   students'   person-related   understanding    of science,   research in  the   past has  tried to
         integrate the teaching of history of science (see, e.g., Brush, 1989; Jenkins, 1989; Klopfer, 1969; Klopfer &
         Cooley, 1963) and science-technology-society (see, e.g., Solomon & Aikenhead, 1994) into science education.
         Despite   the fact   that these    alternative  teaching  approaches    have  helped   students   develop   more   informed
         understanding of related human, social, and cultural aspects in science, they do not necessarily provide students
         with the kind of cognitive learning experience that is highly person-relevant (e.g., personal history of scientists).
         As argued by Michael Novak, "Historical detail, if present, consists only of sprinkling of the names of great
         scientist with no attempt to relate the personalities and personal histories of these people to their discoveries" (as
         cited from Martin & Brouwer, 1991, p.716).
                   Recent research, however, indicates humans not only organize their knowledge around natural objects,
         but also  have    an innate  tendency    to organize    their knowledge    around  people.  For   example,   neurocognitive
         research has suggested that people can possess exceptional knowledge about others, such as knowledge about a
         famous person (Hodges & Graham, 1998; Ross & Hodges, 1997). Social cognitive research also indicates that
         even very young children can have a fairly sophisticated knowledge of others (Bretherton, McNew & Beeghly-
         Smith,  1981).    More    recent   brain  studies  even   suggest    that humans'    memory   for   others   (person-related
         knowledge) is in relation to mental activities that often occurred within a specific brain region (see, e.g., Mason,
         Banfield, & Macrae, 2004; Mitchell, Heatherton, & Macrae, 2002; Thompson, Graham, Williams, Patterson,
         Kapur, & Hodges, 2004). In contrast, mental activities related to object-related knowledge and animal-related
         knowledge     are found   to be  occurring   more    frequently  in  other  specific  brain regions  (Mason,     Banfield,  &
         Macrae,   2004;   Thompson      et al, 2004;    Caramazza     & Shelton,   1998).  These   findings  seem   to   suggest that
         knowledge organized around people may have a special status in human cognition and learning. Yet, little is
         known about the role of such person-relevant knowledge organization in relation to students' science learning
         experience.
                   In the present study, we refer to this phenomenon of knowledge organized around people as "people
         knowledge" (see, Hong, 2005; Hong & Lin, 2005; Lin & Bransford, 2005). Of minimal research in the past that
         investigated  possible    learning effects  in  relation  to  people  knowledge,   it is generally  suggested    that  people
         knowledge is beneficial to learning. For example, Loftus and Loftus (1974) have found that college students'
         people knowledge--as measured by students' recall of names of psychologists--plays a key role in influencing
         how they memorize and retrieve their domain knowledge in psychology. Also, people knowledge--as reflected
         in the extent to which the author's identity and personality is revealed to its readers--is found to be useful for

1-
enhancing students' interest in reading statistical textbooks (Nolen, 1995) and history textbooks (Paxton, 1997).
Lin  and   Bransford    (2005) found   that students'   knowledge     of their  teacher  can   influence whether   and   how
students would like to learn from and work with their teacher. Davis, Lee, Vye, Bransford, & Schwartz (2006)
note  that  the  addition of  people   knowledge    to curricula  can  improve    general   class learning.  Specifically   in
science  education,    Palincsar and   Magnusson      (2001)  found   young     children were  highly   motivated    to learn
because   of the  involvement    of  a fictitious scientist called   Lesley   Park,  who  shared   with  them  documented
personal inquiry experiences regarding investigations of light. Hong & Lin (2005) further suggested that people
knowledge about scientists can play an important role in influencing how students remember and understand
certain scientific concepts. Despite the fact that increased human understanding seems to benefit learning, a
critical issue  that remains   unclear is   the exact  nature of  people  knowledge,     as knowledge    organized   around
people can refer to any aspects of human understanding (e.g., a person's name, personalities, work experiences,
etc.). A more systemic definition and investigation is thus necessary in order to better understand the nature of
people knowledge and its role in relation to science learning.
          Arguably, knowing a person is a continual process and can take two general approaches. It can start
from, for   example,    knowing  a   target person's   name,  profession,    job title, and physical  features  (superficial
people knowledge), to knowing the target person's work experiences, successes, and achievements across life
(in-breadth people knowledge), or to knowing the target person's underlying motives, basic values, dispositions,
personality, strengths and weaknesses in learning, and recurrent patterns in emotions, thought and behavior (in-
depth people knowledge). As argued above, knowledge organized around scientists is rarely seen in science
curricula. If so, it is certainly not the in-depth kind of people knowledge. For example, Souque (1987) has found
that  scientists are all  too  often  superficially presented    only  with   their names   and   dated  discoveries    in the
majority of science textbooks. To some degree, some textbooks may include scientists' personal profiles in a
brief summary.     Such   profiles are however    commonly     presented     in each   chapter as  supplementary     learning
materials, e.g. a scientist's picture with a short description of what he or she has discovered. Other times, they
are presented as a part of the general introduction to the history of science in a single chapter (Brackenridge,
1989). In both cases, the presentation of scientists is highly focused on the superficiality or breadth of people
knowledge, i.e., what they have discovered or accomplished in life. What is rarely seen in science textbooks is
the portrayal of scientists from a more depth-oriented perspective, illustrating scientists' intellectual struggle in
relation to  their theory  building    process.  Unfortunately,   this is also   observed   in informal   science  learning.
According    to  Dagher   and  Ford   (2005),   "Biographies  of  historic   scientists  were  characterized  by   a relative
absence   of description  of   how   scientists arrived at  their knowledge      especially in books    addressing   younger
readers." (p.377). In short, research in the past has not systemically explored the nature of people knowledge
and have not investigated to what extent can different types of people knowledge affect science learning, either.
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the two types of people knowledge (i.e., in-breadth vs. in-
depth  people    knowledge)    have  any  different effects  on   the following   aspects   of science   learning: image    of
scientists, memory, problem-solving, and science learning interest.

Method
          This study was conducted in a public trade school (also a senior high school) in Taipei, Taiwan. In
Taiwan, students are required to take the National Basic Competence Test (NBCT) in order to enter a senior
high school; and usually students who were not able to enter a college-bound general high school will enter a
trade school, and those who were not able to enter a trade school may choose to go to work.              Thus, trade school
students tend to be academically lower-achieving. Based on the NBCT, admission requirement for this school
was a percentile rank of 46th and above, and the average percentile rank for students who entered this school was
51st. For this school in particular, students were trained to be mechanics and technicians. Participants were 323
10th graders (age between 16 and 18) from nine classes, which were selected out of 20 classes using convenience
sampling.    The   nine  classes were    then   randomly   assigned    into  three  conditions:   Breadth-oriented    people
knowledge    (BPK)   group,    depth-oriented   people  knowledge     (DPK)     group,  and superficial  people knowledge
(SPK)/control group.
          This   study  employed    a  between-subject   design   and    the intervention   constitutes  two major   sets   of
learning materials. The first was three science lessons. Introduced from the first to the third lesson were the
following scientific laws/theories: (1) Galileo's Law of Free Fall and Law of Inertia; (2) Newton's three Laws of
Motion and Law of Gravity; and (3) Einstein's Theories of Relativity. The time needed to self-study a lesson is
about 15 minutes. All three groups were required to self-study all three lessons. The second set of learning
materials was concerned with people knowledge. For each scientist in each lesson (e.g., Einstein) introduced,
there were two types of people knowledge materials prepared: BPK and DPK materials. BPK materials profile
scientists'  scientific achievements    across  life.  Below  is  an  exemplified    excerpt:  "Between   1589   and    1592,
Galileo  disproved   Aristotle's   theory that  heavier  objects  fall   faster than lighter   ones, and  in 1610,   Galileo
discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter." By contrast, DPK materials describe scientists' intellectual struggles in
relation to their theory building process. As an example, here is an excerpt: "...While the famous fable suggests

                                                                                                                                 1-
         that Newton was inspired by seeing an apple dropped form a tree, it was actually his hard work and inquisitive
         nature that led to his discovery of the theory of gravity. As he said, `I keep the subject constantly before me, till
         the first dawnings open slowly, little by little, into the full and clear light'." The time needed to self-study each
         scientist (either BPK or DPK) is about 10 minutes. Both sets of materials were adopted from various biographic
         or autobiographic sources (Einstein, 1956; Haven, 1996, 1997; Machamer, 1998; Schilpp, 1951; White, 1997).
         BPK and DPK materials were only used by the BKP and DPK groups respectively. The control group received
         no PK materials. All self-study activities were held in a computer-based learning environment. The PK learning
         materials were   designed   to humanize   science  learning  and to  make     the online   learning environment      more
         humanly inspiring.
                  Major   dependent   variables   in this study  include  the  following    instruments    (all  pilot-tested with
         demographically    similar students): (1)   A "specific   image of   the  three scientists  survey" (three  open-ended
         questions, e.g., "Could you describe three things about Einstein that impress you the most?), employed as a
         post-survey to  assess  students'  specific image  of  the three scientists,  Galileo, Newton,     and  Einstein;  (2) A
         "general image of all scientists survey" (18 Likert-scaled items, e.g., "Scientists takes his/her work seriously.",
         Cronbach Alpha reliability 0.74), used as a pre-post-survey to assess students' image change of all scientists in
         general; (3) The "memory retention test" (three 20-item multiple-choice questions, Cronbach Alpha reliability
         0.70), used as a post-test and was administered twice to measure students' immediate and delayed (after a week)
         memory    retention of  the key   terms/concepts   learned  in  the  three  science lessons;   (4)  A   "well-structured
         problem-solving test" (30 multiple-choice questions, e.g., "Which of the following situations Newton's First
         Law of motion does not apply?", Cronbach Alpha reliability 0.81), employed as a post-test to evaluate students
         understanding of textbook problems; (5) An "ill-structured problem-solving test" (seven open-ended questions,
         e.g., "Could you describe the relationship between Galileo's law of inertia and Newton's First Law of Motion?
         Is there anything in common between these two laws?", content-validated by science experts), a post-test to
         evaluate  students  understanding  of the   relationships between   different   scientific laws/theories studied   in the
         lessons; (6) A "interestingness of the three online science lessons survey" (14 Likert-scaled questions, e.g., "I
         enjoy learning the laws or theories described in the lesson", Cronbach Alpha reliability estimate was 0.93), used
         a post-survey to assess to what extent students think the online science lessons as interesting. In addition, a
         "personal information sheet" was used to collect additional data, e.g., whether students are personally interested
         in science and whether they already possess extensive knowledge about the three scientists under study. The
         section chief of Research Division, Mr. H, at the subject school was the sole experimenter for this study to
         ensure the same experiment procedures were applied in every class.

       Results and discussion
                  To ensure the validity of the study, students who already possess extensive knowledge of the three
         scientists (N=8) and those who did not complete the surveys or tests (numbers vary) were excluded for further
         analysis. As a baseline comparison, students' final science grades from the previous semester were compared. A
         one-way   ANOVA     showed     no significant difference  (F(2,320)=2.97, p>.05)  between    the  three groups  (N=106,
         M=66.8,   SD=11.3   for the DPK    group;   N=110, M=67.1,     SD=11.4    for the BPK      group; and   N=107, M=63.3,
         SD=15.2 for the control group).

        1. Impact of people knowledge on students' specific and general images of scientists
                  First, two specific   kinds  of images--achievement-oriented      vs.  inquiry-oriented--emerged      from   the
         open coding   of data  based   on the grounded   theory   method (Strauss   &   Corbin,    1990). Inter-rater agreement
         between two researchers who coded the two images was 0.96. As a result, it was observed that students tended
         to possess  a much   stronger  achievement-oriented     image   than an   inquiry-oriented   image,    towards the   three
         scientists (Galileo, Newton, and Einstein) introduced in the lessons (t=20.37, df=291, p=.0000). This is to be
         expected as these three scientists are well-known for their scientific achievements. To explore group differences
         in terms of these two specific kinds of images, one-way ANOVAs were conducted. First, a significant difference
         was observed between groups in terms of inquiry-related image (F(2,289)=39.91, p<.001). A post hoc analysis
         showed the DPK group scored higher than both the BPK group (post hoc, p<.001) and the control group (post
         hoc, p<.001). As it appears, DPK students' perceived image of the three scientists tended to be more inquiry-
         related. For example, many DPK students mentioned Galileo never gave up and kept experimenting. Second, in
         terms of the achievement-related image, it was found that the pattern was quite contrary. There is a significant
         difference between groups (F(2,289)=30.71, p<.001) in that the BPK group scored higher than the DPK group
         (post hoc, p<.001) and the control group (post hoc, p<.001). That is, the image of the three scientists perceived
         by the BPK students tended to be more achievement-related. For example, many BPK students mentioned that
         Newton was a genius. In terms of general image of all scientist, within-subject analysis (i.e., pre-post t-tests
         within each group) revealed no significant differences in the DPK group (t=.548, df=94, p>.05, two-tailed) and
         the control group (t=1.492, df=101, p>.05, two-tailed). However, there was a significant difference found in the
         BPK  group    (t=.3053, df=93,    p<.01,  two-tailed), suggesting    that introducing   scientists' achievements      and

1-
successes to students seem to reinforce a less realistic general image of all scientists among students. Table 1
summarizes the findings regarding students' specific and general images of scientists.
          In summary,   the  findings  indicate  that the two  types  of   people knowledge       have  caused   different
imagery effects on science learning. The question is "Why?" One possible explanation is that these two types of
PK represent two very different kinds of personal history. First, DPK represents a more process-oriented kind of
personal history, which highlights a scientist's intellectual struggle in relation to the development of particular
scientific theories. Understandably, one's image of a certain person is largely shaped by one's understanding of
that person. So introducing to students the scientists' knowledge-seeking process should help students gain a
deeper knowledge of how a scientist works with knowledge, thus a more inquiry-related image. By contrast,
BPK represents a more outcome-oriented kind of personal history, which profiles a scientist's major scientific
successes  throughout  life. Knowledge    organization,   as  such, gives  an  overview   of    a person  in a  relatively
thorough, nevertheless superficial, manner. And when over-exposed to scientists' achievements and successes
(breath-oriented people knowledge), an unrealistic image of all scientists (e.g. all scientists are genius) is likely
to take shape. The findings basically confirm the current research on image of scientists. As science education
continues  to  promote  person-neutral   knowledge     (i.e. BPK),   not  DPK,   it is  not   surprising  that  students'
unrealistic or stereotypical image of scientists continue to persist as a long-standing issue (see e.g., Barman,
1997;  Chambers,  1983;  Beardslee     & O'Dowd,    1961;    Souque,  1987; Brush,   1979;    Kirschner,   1992;  Driver,
Leach, Millar & Scott, 1996).

2. Impact of people knowledge on science content knowledge
          Regarding the immediate Memory Test, first, the overall average scores of the three lessons revealed a
significant difference between the three groups (F(2,312)=3.952, p<.05), in which the control group outperformed
the DPK group (post hoc, p<.05). Second, regarding the delayed memory test, the overall average scores of all
three lessons also revealed a significant difference between groups (F(2,312)=9.966, p<.001), with the DPK group
outperforming    the control group  (post   hoc, p<.001).    The pattern  observed   here    is totally opposite  to  that
observed from the immediate Memory Test. Third, in terms of well-structured (textbook) problem-solving, the
overall  average scores  of  all three  lessons  have  revealed  that there was   no    significant  difference  existing
between groups (F (2,312) = 1.626, p = 1.98). Finally, in terms of ill-structured problem-solving test (i.e., test on
students' understanding of the relationships between different scientific laws/theories), the results showed that
there was a significant difference between the three groups (F(2,312)=29.349, p<.001). Post hoc analyses revealed
that the  DPK  group  outperformed     both the  BPK  group   (post hoc,  p<.001)   and  the    control group   (post hoc,
p<.001). As an example, in answering the question, "Could you describe the relationship between Galileo's law
of inertia and Newton's First Law of Motion?", most DPK students (and few BPK students) were able elaborate
that a  commonality   between    these two  laws were   the  concept  of inertia and    that Newton     further improved
Galileo's theory. Table 2 summarizes the results.
          In summary, there are two major findings in the memory test. First, DPK seems to have generated two
interesting opposite effects. That is, in the immediate memory test, the DPK group was outperformed by the
control group, but in the delayed memory test, the DPK group outperformed the control group. Second, the BPK
seems to have generated no effect on both immediate and delayed test results as compared with the control
group. Why? It is conjectured that as compared with BPK, there are relatively stronger emotional components
embedded in the storyline of the DPK. Emotions (such as scientists' passion and love for science, unrelenting
spirit in experiments,  and  deep  commitment     to  knowledge   advancement)      are a natural    part of DPK   when
scientists were portrayed through their intellectual struggle of theory-building. It is believed that such embedded

                                                                                                                             1-
         emotion has influenced how students remembered the key terms in the lessons. As recent emotional research in
         cognitive neuroscience suggests, emotionally arousing events are more likely than more neutral events to be
         recalled later (Labar & Cabeza, 2006; see also Hamann, 2001, for reviews). But this does not explain why the
         same  effect was  not  attained   in the  immediate   memory    test. Perhaps  this can  be  accounted  for also  by an
         emotional factor called "emotion-induced forgetting". According to this theory, "emotionally arousing stimuli
         can  lead to retrograde    amnesia   for preceding events   and anterograde    amnesia   for subsequent  events." (e.g.,
         Hurlemann, Hawellek, Matusch, Kolsch, Wollersen, Madea, et al. 2005). By contrast, BPK seems to have less to
         do with emotions, as compared with DPK, because emotions were less highlighted when profiling scientists'
         objective scientific discoveries and achievements in life. Therefore, it appeared to demonstrate relatively neutral
         effect on students' memory retention, regardless of immediate and delayed memory tests.
                   In terms of findings for ill-structured problems, an important factor that makes DPK useful (and BPK
         less useful)  may be   its  capacity   to make  scientists' thinking   or  theory-building   process more   transparent.
         Clearly, when scientists' intellectual struggle (DPK), is made visible to students, it also makes clearer how a
         scientist thinks during an inquiry (e.g., how he/she formulates and continually improves his/her theory) or how a
         theory generated by one scientist is further improved by another scientist. On the other hand, when PK presented
         by means of scientists' achievements and successes (BPK) or in a superficial manner (i.e., the control group), it
         misses the opportunity for students to learn from (e.g., modeling) and learn through (e.g., perspective-taking)
         scientists' thinking   processes.  This   may explain   why  DPK   was    able to deepen   students' understanding   of
         relationships between scientific laws/theories as the context of scientists' thinking or theory-building processes
         are more accessible. These findings are in agreement with literature regarding the importance of making expert
         thinking visible for modeling learning and problem solving (see, e.g., Collins, Brown & Holum, 1991; Dunbar,
         1995; Dunbar, 2000; Rahm & Downey, 2002; Williams, Papierno, Makel & Ceci, 2004; Schoenfeld, 1985). On
         the other hand, the reason why both types of people knowledge have no impact on well-structured (textbook)
         problem-solving may have to do with the nature of problem types. Textbook problems are usually designed with
         certain recipes or obvious formula as answers or solutions, which are naturally part of the content knowledge
         contained in the three science lessons. Thus, both types of people knowledge provide little help in solving such
         problems.

        3. Impact of people knowledge on interestingness of science lessons
                   Overall analysis.  First, a one-way ANOVA has revealed no significant difference between the three
         groups (F (2, 293) = 1.895, p = .152 for all lessons combined). To explore further, all above participants (n=296)
         were further divided into two groups: those with high individual interest in science (High-II, n=135) and those
         with  low   individual interest in science  (Low-II,    n=151), based  on  their self report  on a  question, "Are you
         interested in science?" surveyed in the Personal Information Sheet. Ten students who did not provide answers
         were excluded from further analysis. As a baseline, these two groups were first compared; and it was found that
         there was a significant difference between these two groups in their rating as to how interesting the three online
         science lessons were to them (t=-4.207, df=284, p<.001, two-tailed). Students with Low-II (N=151) rated the
         three science  lessons  as  much   less   interesting (M=129.17;  SD=25.77)      than students   (N=135) with   High-II
         (M=145.39; SD=25.47). An additional comparison between these two groups further indicated that there is also
         a significant difference (t=3.311, df=300, p<.01) in terms of students' science grades in the previous semester

1-0
(N=140, M=68.7, SD=13 for High-II students; and N=162, M=63.8, SD=12.2 for Low-II students), suggesting
that students  with Low-II    tend also   to be   the low  science  achievers. The  baseline   comparison   suggests  that
students' self report in individual interest was a reliable data for the following analysis.
         Specific analysis on High-II vs. Low-II students.       First, for the High-II group (N=48 for the DPK group,
N=51 for the BPK group, N=41 for the control group), a one-way ANOVA has showed a significant difference
between groups (F(2,132)=4.091, p<.05). A further post hoc analysis showed that the control group scored higher
than the BPK group (p<.05). Second, for the other Low-II group (N=50 for the DPK group, N=51 for the BPK
group, N=53 for the control group), a one-way ANOVA showed that a significant difference exists between
groups (F(2,148)=5.20, p<.01) in which the DPK group outperformed the control group (post hoc, p<.01). Table 3
summarize the results in this section.
         According to Hidi and Anderson (1992), there are two fundamental kinds of interest: individual and
situational interest. Individual (or personal) interest basically means interest that students bring to some learning
environment. For example, typically some students will come to a science classroom already interested in the
subject while others may not (Mitchell, 1993). On the other hand, situational interest means interest that students
acquire by participating in a learning environment. In summary, there are two major findings in this aspect of
science learning: (1) for students with low individual interest, DPK appeared to have a positive effect on how
they perceived the interestingness of the online lessons (i.e., situational interest due to environment); and (2) for
students with high individual interest, BPK appeared to have a negative effect on situational interest. For the
first finding, one possible explanation may be when students' individual interest is low, situational interest due
to environment   becomes      more  important.    According    to   Kintsch (1980)  there  are two types    of text-based
situational interest: cognitive and emotional interest. It is possible that the two types of text-based situational
interest were  aroused  by    scientists' visible  thinking   and   emotions  embedded    in DPK;  therefore   situational
interest due to the environment was raised. For the second finding, when students' individual interest is high, it
is relatively more difficult to get them even more interested in the lessons. And the reason why the BPK group
perceived  the  interestingness  of the   online   lessons (situational interest)  as less   interesting may   be because
information about scientists' achievements and successes is less relevant to the overall understanding of the
three science lessons.

Conclusions
         The findings in the present study have suggested that providing students with a more person-relevant
science learning experience can benefit their science learning. But more importantly, the findings also revealed
that in  order for people knowledge       to be   beneficial, it is essential to distinguish between     knowledge   about
scientists (breadth-oriented people knowledge) and knowledge of scientists (depth-oriented people knowledge)
when introducing people knowledge into science learning. As assessed in the present study, it is only the in-
depth kind  of  people knowledge     that    will help students   develop   a more realistic image   of  scientists, better
understand the evolutionary nature of scientific theories, and shape a more humanly inspiring science learning
environment. Unfortunately, the kind of people knowledge being introduced in science education tends to be the
superficial and in-breadth kinds. As argued by Hodson (1998), "The school science curriculum continues to
promote some grossly distorted views of scientists" (p.191). In concluding, we would like to cite what I. I. Rabi,
a Nobel Laureate in Physics, cogently proposed as an alternative to science teaching and learning:

                                                                                                                               1-1
                 Science is an adventure of the whole human race to learn to live in and perhaps to love the universe in
         which they are. To be a part of it is to understand, to understand oneself, to begin to feel that there is a capacity
         within man  far  beyond  what  he  felt he had,  of an   infinite extension of  human   possibilities...I propose that
         science be taught at whatever level, from the lowest to the highest, in the humanistic way. It should be taught
         with a certain historical understanding, with a certain philosophical understanding, with a social understanding
         and a human understanding in the sense of the biography, the nature of the people who made this construction,
         the triumphs, the trials, the tribulations. (Holton, Rutherford, & Watson, 1970).
