          Abstract: Does learning with multimedia promote students' ability to identify variables and
          infer relations  among   various  elements   within   given   textual  and   visual information,   thus
          deepening   system   thinking?  This study     examined     150 undergraduate     students' ability  to
          identify systems' components (i.e., variables), overt and covert relations, as well as construct
          new relations among these variables, based either on a multiple-representation (MR) display
          that  resembled   rich textbook   materials    (n=82)    or a single-representation    (SR)  text-only
          display (n=68). Findings showed that the experimental MR group elicited relations better than
          the controls (SR), regarding relations' accuracy, descriptive level, and novelty, and regarding
          number   of information    sources  and    diversity  of    variables used.  Discussion   focused    on
          different visual representation types and on implications of this ecologically valid study for
          enhancing students' system thinking.

          Revealing   and   comprehending    relations     among    variables   are essential  cognitive    operations  for
achieving  system    understanding   in all domains.     For   the  interpretation  of behaviors   involved    in systemic
phenomena, individuals have to identify relevant system components (variables), to describe the nature of overt
relations among them and draw conclusions about covert systemic relations. Frequently, individuals are required
to construct   novel  relations, not evidenced  at   first  glance,   which  may   promote    explanations  of the system
behavior. The importance of the ability to elicit relations as an initial step towards developing system thinking,
called for the present study. Therefore, we examined university students' ability to identify systems' components
(i.e., variables), overt and covert interrelations, as well as to construct new ones. We compared this students'
competence while learning given information in an ecologically valid setting (i.e., preparing homework) from
multimedia displays versus learning from single-representation displays of textual information only.

The Importance of Eliciting Relations among Variables
       A system is a collection of continuously interacting components, forming a functioning entity (Forrester,
1968). System thinking comprises a multifaceted high-order skill that incorporates the recognition of patterns of
system  behavior   or the  prediction  of behaviors   in   particular  conditions   (Booth  Sweeney   &   Sterman,  2000;
Frank, 2000; Ossimitz, 2007). Underlying system thinking is the prerequisite basic ability of identifying the
system's components (variables) and their diverse interrelations. The need to develop system thinking arises in
all domains (Beach, 1998; Eilam, 2008; Eilam & Poyas, 2006; Hmelo, Holton, & Kolodner, 2000; Kali, Orion,
& Elon, 2003; Senge, 1990). Mostly, relations' elicitation is carried out while learning from visual, textual, or
multimedia representations of phenomena rather than identifying systemic relations in reality.

Visual Representations of Relations among Variables
       Some visual representation types were found to surpass others in effectiveness for conveying relations
(Kosslyn, 2006; Shah, Hegarty, & Mayer, 1999). Classic examples are pie, line, or bar graphs as well as tables
of numbers to convey quantitative relations, and diagrams, charts, or schematic drawings to convey different
types  of qualitative relations  among    entities, like spatial,  structural,  functional, etc. Although   maps   convey
quantitative   relations, they do  so  concerning    spatial entities   only (Kosslyn,  2006).     In all  cases, learning
outcomes do not depend on the features of such representations alone but also on their interaction with the
cognitive processes involved in the information processing (Salomon, 1979), as well as with the             type of task at
hand (Carswell, 1992; Kosslyn, 2006; Meyer, 2000).
          Differently from graphs, charts represent the quality of various entities in the form of maps, diagrams,
flow charts, family trees and so forth, rather than representing these entities related amounts.          Charts describe
who (or which) relates to whom (or to which) or in certain cases also, who (or what) influences whom (or what).
Charts' employment of diverse means (e.g., lines for connecting the different symbols, symbols' organization in
a  two dimensional    space)   enables representation    of  a great  variety   of relations, like spatial, functional, or
relations of inclusion (Kosslyn, 2006). However, the very diversity of these means requires learner awareness of
their properties.
          Charts have properties of both texts and pictures. Although they have some text inserted in them, charts
such as diagrams or family trees differ from texts in that the logical or syntactical relationships that exist among
the concepts are described spatially, rather than in a sentential representation, therefore requiring lower amounts

                                                                                                                               1-0
         of mental effort to process them (Larkin & Simon, 1987; Winn & Holliday, 1982). Winn (1991) claimed that the
         type of  spatial configuration   for objects   or  concepts in  a representation   affects various processes   that   are
         involved  in human    perception. He    discriminated  between    maps  ­  that represent  the spatial organization   of
         objects included in a certain space ­ and diagrams ­ that express conceptual relationships spatially. Maps and
         diagram are effective for showing physical layout ­ how things are put together and work; can serve as a schema
         for organizing information; can represent abstract ideas in a concrete manner; and require the use of spatial
         skills. With less demands made on working memory, they leave cognitive resources that may enables learners to
         carry out higher level processing (Winn, 1991).
                   Use of different representation-types is abundant in educational settings. We next discuss learning with
         multi-representational displays and the elicitation of relations from information presented in them.

        Learning from Multimedia
                   Multiple representation (MR) displays contain more than one type of representation of information and
         data, allowing learners to simultaneously inspect visual and textual materials. MRs' inclusion of visual displays
         may  promote   learners' ability to  elicit relations more  than  do  text presentation  alone  while  requiring fewer
         cognitive resources   (Larkin &   Simon,    1987)  as well  as  promote their   systemic  thinking (Kali et al., 2003).
         However, many studies have reported students' difficulties in translating and integrating multimedia information
         bits into a  comprehensive    whole,  especially    with regard   to information   presented   concurrently in   several
         representation modes (e.g., textually and visually) (Ainsworth, 1999; Goldman, 2003; van der Meij & de Jong,
         2004;  Yerushalmy,    1991).  In  spite of   visual representations   requirement  for   decreased mental   efforts   for
         processing each representation distinctly, their integration with other representations (visual or text) increases
         the mental efforts required due to learners' needs to actively construct understanding while learning, by building
         references and mapping across them, as well as translating between them (Mayer, 2003; Schnotz & Bannert,
         2003). Investment of increased mental efforts may result in a high cognitive load and a decrease in available
         mental resources, which may impede learners' performance (Chandler & Sweller, 1992; Mayer, 2003; Mayer,
         Heiser, & Lonn, 2001; Tiene, 2000).

        The Present Study
                Based   on reported  principles  of   learning with  multi-media    the  present study  examined   the  effect of
         learning from an MR display versus a text-only display on university students' ability to elicit relations. Instead
         of the usually controlled, short-term, laboratory-like task conditions, the current MR and single representation
         (SR)  displays   were used for   learning   in an  ecologically  valid setting  of preparing   homework    task  during
         university courses in education. Our learning materials resembled the richness and complexity of current school
         textbook designs found in many subject-matter domains. The aim of the study was to examine if learning with a
         rich, complex MR display (experimental group) would improve students' ability to elicit relations better than
         learning from an SR display of text only (control group). We predicted that, overall, compared to SR students,
         students  in the  MR   group  would     score  higher  on:  (1) task  performance    as a  whole;  (2) the  number    of
         information sources (cards) used; (3) three aspects of relations ­ (i) accuracy, (ii) description level, and (iii)
         novelty; and (4) the number of variables used in eliciting relations.

       Method
        Participants
                   Participants were 150 undergraduate students (118 females and 32 males) aged 18 to 30 years who
         were enrolled in two education courses in the Faculty of Education. Eighty two students were assigned to the
         MR group; age of M = 23.31 years, SD = 2.58; 79% female.          Sixty eight students were assigned to the SR group;
         age of M = 24.73 years, SD = 5.34, 88% female. The size difference between the groups (82 vs. 68) emerged
         after 14 students of diverse abilities from the SR group discontinued their participation, claiming boredom and
         lack of motivation to deal with the task. The two groups did not differ significantly in their mean grade point
         average: MR: 83.7 (SD = 4.54); SR: 84.8 (SD = 4.52), t (148) = 1.41, p = .16.

        Materials
                   The materials consisted of 18 SR information cards comprising text only (each containing between 47
         and 299 words, with most cards being around 120 words); 18 MR information cards comprising visual and
         textual data; and a homework task given to both groups. Cards and task information pertained to cellular phones.
         SR and MR Information Card Sets: Each card in each set offered only one representation mode--either textual
         or pictorial. Each MR card contained highly similar information (in content and details) to that contained in its
         twin SR   card of text only;  namely,   each   set of cards contained  similar  information   represented  by  different
         symbolic language. Similarity was ensured by two experts, each describing the information contained in either
         each  of the 18  MR   or SR  cards.  Descriptions   given  for  twin cards of   each pair  were compared    in order  to
         determine their degree of overlapping. Cards representations were refined until achieving a minimum of 75% of

1-0
overlapping information. The MR cards contained minimal printed texts (e.g., headings, labels, legends), and
included 4 text cards and 14 pictorial cards like bar chart, line graph, pie chart, drawing, map, numerical tables
and a technical schema. The topic selected was the cellular phones representing various systemic aspects and
levels (i.e., transmission of radio waves, coverage areas, cell phones' general properties and functions, users'
characteristics, hazards in use, and the history of this technology). Each aspect could be represented by one or
few cards. Components and their interrelations could be found or inferred from information presented either on
single cards (thus in one mode only) or on several cards (thus in several representation types for the MR group).
Card numbering enabled students to report the particular cards they had employed for responding to each task
question, permitting the identification of the specific information sources (cards) and the number of cards used.
        Displaying information on distinct   cards enabled students  to   organize   them  in space in   ways that
increased learners' gains from the spatial contiguity effect (Mayer, 2003). However, simultaneous processing of
information that is presented in several cards may overload the limited capacity of working memory and impede
performance due to a high cognitive load (Chandler & Sweller, 1992).
Homework  Task: The  task contained three    open-ended  questions. Question   1     asked students to elicit four
relations among the various components that they had identified in the cards information. This question aimed
to reveal students' ability to identify components (variables) of the systems as described overtly in the cards, to
verbalize the relations they perceive between these overt components, to formulate covert relations, and/or to
integrate information across various cards to infer novel relations. Question 2 required students to construct a
novel relation between the given variables presented on a single textual card (i.e., thermal effect, time, and
users' health) and another variable they had to identify on a different card (age). Question 3 directed students to
two specific cards (i.e., a pie graph and a geographical map for the MR group and two text cards for the SR
group) and asked them to infer new relations from the information presented in them. In addition, students were
asked to locate an additional information card that verified these inferred relations (i.e., a numerical table card
for the MR group and a text card for the SR group). This task required the integration of information presented
in three cards, namely, three different representation types for the MR group and three texts for the SR group.

Procedure
        This study is a part of a larger study (Eilam & Poyas, 2008). Students were told they would receive a
set of information cards that contained all the information they would need for completing the task.   To prevent
interference by the course contents, students in each group (SR and MR) received a hard copy of 18 SR or MR
cards in the beginning of the course. Cards remained at students' disposal while completing the task. They were
told that they could arrange the cards as they deemed convenient and efficient. The task comprised routine
homework for credit to promote students' motivation and to optimize their cards' exploration. Performance time
was not limited, and each student signed a written consent to work alone.

Data Coding and Analysis
      Each elicited relation in students' responses to the three questions was coded, using each of the relevant
following criteria, and scored accordingly. Differences between groups and between the various criteria below
were calculated using the Mann-Whitney test.
General Performance: For both student groups, the total performance score for eliciting relations was calculated
as the sum of the following three scores, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 35 as described next:
(1) Number of Information Cards  Used (relevant    only to Question  1):   As described    above, each   card was
numbered. Based on students' indication of the card number used for each elicited relation, the following criteria
and scoring were applied: (i) missing response, no indication of card number, or erroneous card number - 0
points. (ii) use of a single card per relation - 1 point. (iii) use of more than a single card per relation ­ 2 points.
Inasmuch as Question 1 asked students to elicit four core relations, possible scores ranged from 0 to 8.
(2) Relation Description Level (relevant only to Questions 1 and 3): this criterion, referring to participants' level
of description for the elicited relations. An inaccurate or a missing response scored 0 points. Regarding accurate
responses, three levels of description were coded: (i) identification of the variables only (1 point), e.g., "age and
cell phone bills." (ii) qualitative, narrative-type verbal description of the relation (2 points), e.g., "the antennae
transmit to three cells." (iii) quantitative description of the relations (3 points), e.g., "the less distance from the
antennae ­ the higher the radiation intensity." Possible scores ranged from 0 to 15.
(3) Relation Novelty (Relevant only to Question 1): An inaccurate or a missing response scored 0 points. Three
levels of novelty were coded for accurate relations: (i) no novelty, i.e., verbalizing a relation that was overtly
presented verbally or visually (1 point), e.g., directly presented text like "many governmental regulations control
transmission frequencies" or a relation presented inherently in a particular graph or table. (ii) low-level novelty,
i.e., inferring a relation that was covertly presented verbally or visually on a single card (2 points), e.g., inferring
spatial relations from the map card. Low-level novelty may reflect only a limited and local understanding of the
given information, regarding one particular relation in the relevant system, and thus does not ensure a systemic
understanding of the phenomenon. (iii) high-level novelty, i.e., inferring a new relation that was not presented in

                                                                                                                            1-0
         any one card; rather, students had to synthesize a new relation from information presented verbally or visually
         on more than a single card (3 points). Possible scores ranged from 0 to 12.
         Relation Accuracy: Each relation in all three questions was scored as either accurate (1 point) or inaccurate (0
         points) with regard to the information presented in the cards, therefore reflecting students' understanding of this
         information and ability to elicit relations relevant to it. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 6.
         Number    of Variables   Used   in  Eliciting Relations     (relevant only   to   Question    1): The   number   of different
         variables  that students   elicited  in forming     their relations   was    analyzed.   Based    on   the greater  salience,
         explicitness and distinctiveness of system components when presented via visual rather than textual modes, we
         hypothesized that the MR group would identify a larger number of variables in comparison to the SR group.

       Results and Discussion
        General Effects of MRs on Elicitation of Relations
                  The  findings   (see Table  1)  supported    our   first hypothesis;   namely,    the MR   group   scored  generally
         significantly higher than the SR group (range: 0 to 35), U = 1644.00, p < .001, significantly higher than SR
         students  on  eliciting four  core relations  as  desired   (Question   1),  U    = 1673.50,   p  < .001,  but no significant
         difference   emerged    between the  groups   for   eliciting a   novel relation     using three  cards   (Question 3),  U =
         2426.50, p = .13. This latter question required students to integrate three different representation types, a pie
         graph, a  geographical   map,   and  a  numerical    table, shown   to  cause     a high cognitive   load. Such   integration
         possibly  hindered   students'  performance,   offsetting   the   advantages      of learning  with    multimedia.  The  MR
         students scored significantly higher than the SR students on each of the four possible core relations that could be
         elicited in Question 1, U = 1891.00, p < .001; U = 1770.00, p < .001; U = 1828.00, p < .001; and U = 2008.00, p
         < .01, respectively.

                  The relatively high standard deviations that were obtained for all of the results may be attributed to the
         large heterogeneity of the university's student body.

        Effects of MRs on Various Aspects of Relation Elicitation
        Number of cards used
                Our   second  hypothesis     was confirmed     as  well.   As  can    be   seen in  Table    1, the MR    group   used
         significantly more   cards for  eliciting each    of the  four    relations in Question    1,  U  = 2119.50,   p <  .01; U =
         1903.00, p < .001; U = 1857.50, p < .001; and U = 2137.50, p < .01, respectively, and for all of them together, U
         = 1762.00, p < .001.     The use of a higher number of cards may reflect MR students' identification of more
         components in the visual cards, due to these variables' higher salience and distinctiveness in pictures compared
         to their salience in texts. This saliency released learners from the need to perform a systematic reading of card
         information that would reveal additional, less salient components and relations in this same card.

Level of Relation Description
      Relations'       level of   description  may   reflect  students' competencies     regarding   the   identification of
components (variables) in the system and the verbalization of their quantitative interrelations (see Table 1). For
Question   1   (eliciting  four   core relations), the  MR    group  students   scored significantly    higher on    relation
description level than did their SR counterparts, both generally, U = 1734.50, p < .001, and for each of the four
relations separately, U = 1873.00, p < .001; U = 1789.50, p < .001; U = 1984.50, p = .001; U = 1997.50, p < .01,
respectively. Again, no significant difference between the groups was found for Question 3, which required the
integration    of  three   representation-types.   As   mentioned    above,   the    characteristics inherent    to  certain
representation types, like tables and graphs, directly and explicitly represent quantitative relations. This may
have enabled MR students' to formulate higher level quantitative relations, which not necessarily stem from a
better systemic understanding. However, based on theories of learning with multimedia, these results may also
suggest  MR    students'   increased   general understanding    of the  information,  which  enabled    them  to formulate
relations at a higher quantitative level.

Level of Relation Novelty
      MR group students scored significantly higher on relations novelty level than did their SR counterparts
(see Table 1), both generally, U = 1978.00, p < .01, and for each of the four relations separately, U = 2199.00, p
< .01; U = 1940.50, p < .001; U = 1961.00, p = .001; U = 2176.50, p < .01, respectively. These findings may be
interpreted    by considering   the characteristics  of a  system.  Ability  to infer new  relations  may   demonstrate    a
global understanding of occurrences in the represented system, whereas the verbalization of relations that are
explicitly or     even implicitly  presented  in the cards    may  suggest a  limited understanding     of local occurence
rather than the global complexity of the system.

Accuracy
      The mean accuracy score for all three questions combined was significantly higher for the MR group (M
= 4.28, SD = 1.45) than for the SR group (M = 2.93, SD = 1.81), U = 1582.50, p < .001(see Table 2). This
pattern emerged for the set of four relations required in Question 1 (MR group: M = 3.16, SD = 1.31; SR group:
M = 2.16, SD = 1.62), U = 1841.50, p < .001. Chi-tests performed for each relation in Question 1 showed the
same pattern of MR significantly outperforming SR. This same pattern also emerged for Question 2, which
required students to form novel relation between given variables presented on a single textual card and another
variable they     had  to identify on  one of  the  other  cards.  This pattern  did  not emerge for    Question  3,  which
required   students    to    integrate 3  representation-types,    probably   causing     cognitive  overload,   hindering
performance.

Number of Variables Identified
      We     examined     variable  diversity  for the  four  core relations elicited in  Question   1. We   computed     the
number of diverse variables (e.g., distance from antennae, radiation) that the students as a group identified for
each pair of variables comprising a relation (see Table 3). In other words, the 82 students in the MR group
showed relatively low component diversity in both steps of constructing the first relation: As a group, they
elicited only     12 different  components    as their  first variables and   23 different  components     as  their second
variables in the first relation. Note that the variables could overlap between the four relations. SR group also
identified similar number of first and second variables in the first relation. However, Table 3 demonstrates the
increasing difficulty of the SR students to identify new, different variables as they progressed from the first to
the fourth relation, as compared with the MR students' performance (see especially the fourth relation). This
difficulty supports     our  assumption   regarding    the advantages   inherent  in  presenting information     via  visual
modes,   due   to  the components'     higher  salience and   distinctiveness in pictures  than  in  texts and   due  to  the
relations' more direct presentation in some of the pictorial cards.

                                                                                                                                 1-11

          representation

                 An additional phenomenon seen in this table for both student groups was that the diversity of the second
         variable always surpassed that of the first. We believe this phenomenon reflects students' tactics in eliciting
         relations: first locating the most salient variable; only then looking for a second variable that could interrelate
         with the salient first one. Since the second variables were less salient, students possibly located a large variety of
         them, leading to the second variables higher diversity. It is also possible that the search for a second variable
         was more comprehensive and deep because of their lessened saliency.

        Use of Representation Types by MR Students
                 Finally, we examined our assumption that the level of relation description as well as the level of relation
         novelty  would   be    related to specific   characteristics of   particular  visual representation  types.  For  each
         representation type, we calculated the mean frequency of respondents who indicated that they had used it when
         eliciting relations (by indicating the card number they used). Table 4 presents the data for the more frequently
         used representation types, regarding the level of description and of novelty achieved.

         Note. Data pertain to all four relations from Question 1 together (8 identified variables per student).

                 Generally, the number of respondents who used text was highest (30%), followed by users of tables
         (24%),  the line graph   (10%),   and  the map   (5%). Interestingly,  although   better performance    has often been
         reported for learning with multimedia, our students still preferred to elicit relations from texts.
                 Most learners who elicited accurate relations from textual cards (64%) described them only qualitatively,
         in a narrative manner (level 2 of description), whereas most learners who elicited accurate relations from graphs
         (87%)   or numerical   tables  (80%)  reached  a higher, quantitative   level  of description (level 3) (see Table   4).
         Therefore, a higher score on the level of description does not necessarily appear to suggest a deeper systemic
         understanding but rather the use of certain representation types.
                 Concerning the levels of novelty, Table 4 shows that the accurate relations elicited by 92% of those
         students who used texts merely verbalized a relation that was overtly presented in the cards (level 1). The same
         pattern of  results was  found    for tables (90%)  and  graphs   (100%),    due  to the inherent properties  of  these
         representations, which explicitly present relations.   On the other hand, the few students who used the map to
         elicit relations achieved the second level of novelty (a relation presented implicitly in the information). One
         student even inferred a new relation (third level), reporting the use of a map jointly with the pie graphs. Hence,
         like the outcomes for description level, the findings for novelty level indicated that the relations that students
         elicited from the information cards were connected to the information's representation type.

       Conclusions
                  In the present study, we inquired about the various aspects related to eliciting relations. Our claim is
         that an inability   to identify  systemic  components    and    their interrelations will  preclude  individuals' deep

1-1
understanding of a system's events and phenomena. We further assert that a local understanding of only specific
relations  may    hinder   these  individuals'  understanding      of the systemic    functioning    and general   patterns of
behavior, as would be expressed in their inability to elicit new relations for this system.
          Generally, our study corroborated prior findings reporting that learning from multimedia resulted in
better performance than learning from text alone. Our study's contribution originates from: (a) the unique type
of task administered to students ­ eliciting relations, (b) the information cards' resemblance to actual textbook
chapters in terms of their richness and variety of representation types, and (c) the performance of the task in an
ecologically   valid   university   education  setting. These   design    properties  permitted  further  insights into  some
aspects   of learning   with  multimedia.   Like  other   studies, we    have  shown   that MR   students   performed    better
regarding various aspects of eliciting relations (number of cards used, descriptive level, novelty, accuracy, as
well  as  the  diversity   of the variables used    for forming    relations), in  comparison   to   SR  students. The   better
performance     found   in  the MR   group  for   all these  aspects   may  evolve   from   the principles  of learning  with
multimedia (Mayer, 2005), and more specifically in our study the effect of factors like the salience of variables
presented in a pictorial format as well as the inherent characteristics of certain representation types. Both these
factors increase learners' awareness about components in the system as well as their interrelations. These also
brought about the use of more cards for identifying variables and a broader diversity of variables in the elicited
relations.
          Levels     of description   and   novelty    may   serve    as  indicators  for   a deeper    and  holistic system
understanding     rather   than a superficial  and    local one.   The ability  to infer  novel  relations  suggests  a  more
comprehensive        perception   of a    phenomenon      functioning    within   the  system;   it  demonstrates     learners'
conceptualization of implicit behavior patterns within the system and thus its complexity. This ability to infer
new relations required students' integration of bits of information from more than a single card.                  Therefore,
high-level relations' novelty may suggest students' construction of mental models that reflect the systemic nature
of the information (Ben-Zvi Assaraf & Orion, 2005; Goldman, 2003; Ossimitz, 2007).
          Our findings concerning the integration of three different representation-types (Question 3), showing
no difference between the MR and SR groups, was explained in the literature by the difficulties inherent to the
integration   of various    representation  types   (Ainsworth,    1999;  van  der   Meij  &  de Jong,   2004;  Yerushalmy,
1991). In our case, to respond to the question, students had to integrate among a pie chart, a map, and a table of
numbers, which, according to Kosslyn (2006), all represent quantitative relationships. In this respect, they were
expected to be integrated by students without specific difficulty. However, pies and tables convey quantitative
relationships concerning amounts, whereas maps convey quantitative relationships concerning spaces. In this
sense, integration    was   probably  hindered    and   posed an   obstacle for   students' performance,    which   offset  the
advantages inherent to visual representations.
       An examination of the kind of representations MR students used for eliciting relations suggested that
they preferred to explore texts and familiar representations that are frequently used in school learning materials,
hardly considering other representation types such as technical schema.
          Inasmuch      as we   did not  measure  students'   motivation    in the present    study, we  cannot   exclude   the
possibility  that this  may   have   also  affected results  as well,  because    learning  from multimedia    may    be more
motivating and interesting than learning from text alone, as suggested by other studies (Ainsworth, 1999; Peeck,
1993) and by the fact that all 14 students who dropped out of the current study were assigned to the text-only
control group. It is important to scrutinize this issue in future research.
Theoretical and Practical Implications: With system thinking considered currently to constitute a core issue for
instruction,  relation  elicitation  should be  a   basic   requirement.  Our  results may    inform  curriculum   designers,
teachers, and researchers concerning the ability to elicit relations while learning with multimedia. Our "noisy"
field study    suggests    that its  ecologically   valid   findings  are particularly   meaningful     for decision  making
regarding learning this issue in actual educational systems.
Study  Limitations      and   Future Directions:    Despite   its  advantages,  some   limitations   may    emerge  from    the
"noisiness"   of  this  field research   when  it is  applied   in authentic   educational    contexts.  Possible  intervening
factors might be, for example, students' prior knowledge concerning cell phones and representation types, as
well  as  their  motivation.    Moreover,   the   present   study  did  not examine    students'  academic     background   or
disposition   (i.e., scientific   versus  humanistic),  which     could   have affected   students'  abilities regarding    the
elicitation of relations. We suggest that future research should carefully measure students' motivation, attend to
possible differences in students' background knowledge, and deepen the examination of students' strategies for
eliciting  the  relations   presented   in MR   displays,    which    may   inform   textbook   and  technology    curriculum
designers.
