        Fostering Epistemological Beliefs and Conceptual Change
                       In Chemistry Using Knowledge Building

         Abstract: This study investigated the role of knowledge building in fostering conceptual and
         epistemological   changes    in  the   context  of Grade  10    chemistry students    collaborating   on
         Knowledge     Forum   in   a Hong    Kong   classroom. Participants   were   40  experimental  and    39
         comparison students experiencing knowledge building and traditional instruction respectively.
         Students engaging in knowledge building posed questions, generated theories and hypothesis,
         constructed explanations, and revised their theories mediated by Knowledge Forum. Various
         measures  were   collected   at  pre and posttests  including   epistemological   beliefs, conceptual-
         change  questions  and     online  discourse   and  reflection. Results  indicated that   experimental
         students made more gains than comparison students on both conceptual and epistemological
         measures.   Epistemological     beliefs and  knowledge-building      reflection  were correlated   with
         science learning; regression analyses indicated that knowledge-building reflection and inquiry
         contributed to conceptual change over and above prior knowledge and epistemological beliefs.
         Implications   of knowledge        building  for   developing   epistemological   beliefs  and    meta-
         conceptual awareness for conceptual change are discussed.

Introduction
         Considerable   debates   and  interests have    now  been given   to  examining   cognitive  and   socio-cultural
perspectives of learning (Anderson, Reder & Simon, 1997) and conceptual change (Mason, 2007). Traditionally,
conceptual  change   has been  viewed     from   the cognitive  perspective   emphasizing   cognitive   conflict  (Posner,
Strike, Hewson  &    Gertzog,  1982),     ontological shifts (Chi, Slotta    & de  Leeuw,   1994)   and epistemological
commitment in knowledge restructuring (Vosniadou & Brewer, 1987). Currently, conceptual change has been
examined from the socio-cultural perspective emphasizing enculturation of practice and discursive interactions
and social construction of knowledge in the science classroom (Scott, Asoko & Leach, 2007). Whereas it is now
recognized that cognitive and situated perspectives are to be integrated (Mason, 2007; Vosniadou, 2007), less
attention has been given to how learning environment can be designed to bridge these two perspectives, and
how to foster epistemological change and metaconceptual awareness mediated by collective discursive practice.
         Recent  research   on    intentional   conceptual   change   emphasizes    the   role of   learner's  intentions,
epistemological beliefs, motivation, and agency in knowledge restructuring (Sinatra & Pintrich, 2003). It also
points to the need to design learning environments that encourage learners to integrate goal-directed strategies
and to develop metaconceptual awareness for intentional conceptual change. A major related strand that has
attracted much attention examines epistemological beliefs or beliefs about the nature of knowledge, knowing
and learning (Hofer & Pintrinch, 2003). Increased research evidence has shown how these beliefs can facilitate
or constrain student understanding, reasoning, thinking, and science learning. For example, research indicated
that a belief about knowledge as certain and simple was negatively correlated with conceptual change learning
from refutational text. Students' immature beliefs about learning and knowledge are related to difficulties in
their conceptual   understanding      (Qian   and    Alvermann,   2000).     Students  who   hold   more    sophisticated
epistemological beliefs are more likely to consider conflictual and controversial information; epistemological
beliefs have  been shown    as    a   major predictor   of  argumentation    (Mason    &  Scirica,  2006).  For  example,
Stathopoulou and Vosniadou (2007 examined the relationships between physics-related epistemological beliefs
and physics conceptual understanding amongst 10th grade students. Whereas there has been much progress on
examining the relationship between epistemological beliefs and science learning, most research conducted are
correlation studies. There have been much fewer studies on how these beliefs can be modified and how they
interact with conceptual change with social-constructivist instructional practice.
         This study    proposes   the  use  of   computer-supported      collaborative learning  environment      to foster
epistemological  beliefs   and  conceptual      change   emphasizing     the socio-cognitive   dynamics     of  collective
knowledge    building. An  emergent    research  strand   on collaborative   learning  and social   context is the   use of
computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment (Lehtinen, Hakkarainen, Lipponen, Rahikainen
and   Muukkonen,   1999).   A   prominent     example    of  an   educational  approach    using   CSCL     technology   is
"knowledge building" that emphasizes that knowledge as collective work of a community, and knowledge is
improvable by means of discourse (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006). Knowledge building has been characterized
as a  third metaphor   of  learning    as `knowledge-creation'     (Paavola,   Lipponen,   &   Hakkarainen,    2004)   that
integrates the "knowledge-acquisition" (cognitive) and "participation" (situated) metaphors (Sfard, 1998). To
support  progressive   discourse, Knowledge      Forum   (KF),  a multimedia   database   constructed  by   students, was
designed  to support   collective   knowledge    advances   (Scardamalia   &   Bereiter, 1994).  In knowledge-building
communities,  students   make  progress     not only  in improving  their  personal   but also in  developing   collective

                                                                                                                              1-1
         knowledge    through    progressive  inquiry.  In  knowledge     building    classroom,     students posed    cutting-edge
         problems, generated theories and conjectures, searched for scientific information, elaborated on others' ideas
         and co-construct explanation, and they collectively revised their theories mediated by in both Knowledge forum.
                   Research on knowledge building has shown how the approach can help restructure scientific discourse,
         foster deep  understanding,    and enhance   inquiry-based   scientific  understanding    (e.g., Caswell   and Bielaczyc,
         2001; Lee, Chan & van Aalst, 2006; van Aalst & Chan, 2007). Hakkarainen (2004) analysed young students'
         written productions in Physics posted to CSILE's database, and indicated that they engaged in epistemic agency
         and   pursed explanation-driven    inquiry  and  some   of them   moved    towards   theoretical   scientific explanation.
         Zhang et al (2007) examined socio-cognitive dynamics examining epistemic agency of students in advancing
         their science knowledge for 5th and 6th grade students. Vosniadou and Kollias (2003) employed Knowledge
         Forum   to  foster the  development    of discourse   and  students'  ideas,   beliefs, and  metaconceptual    awareness.
         Whereas there are various studies examining science learning in knowledge-building classroom, thus far, there
         have   been  few   studies  that systematically  examined    knowledge     building  and    conceptual   change  in   more
         complex science domains. In particular, the relations of epistemological beliefs and metaconceptual awareness
         and conceptual change fostered through progressive discourse on Knowledge Forum need to be investigated.
                    Accordingly, this study investigated the roles of computer-supported knowledge-building inquiry in
         conceptual change and epistemological shift in the domain of chemistry among high school students in the Hong
         Kong   context.  The   following  research   questions were    addressed:  (1)  What    were  the  effects of  knowledge
         building on science learning and conceptual change? (2) What was the nature of epistemological beliefs, and
         what were the effects of knowledge building on epistemological change? And (3) What characterized students'
         engagement on Knowledge Forum, and what were the relationships among epistemological beliefs, knowledge-
         building process and conceptual change?

       Method
        Participants
                   Seventy-nine tenth graders in two science classes in Hong Kong participated in this study. There were
         40 students in the experimental class and 39 students in the comparison class. The lessons were conducted in
         English and students in the experimental group wrote notes in English on Knowledge Forum. Both classes were
         taught by the same teacher, the researcher who had taught high school chemistry with over ten years and had
         used knowledge building pedagogy for 4 years.

        Procedure and Design
                   This study employed a quasi-experimental pre-posttest research design. The study was conducted in the
         second semester of 2006-2007 (Feb to May). There were five chemistry lessons each week; each lesson was of
         35-minute   duration.  In  the experimental   class, students    learned electrochemistry    in  the knowledge-building
         collaborative environment using inquiry-based and collaborative activities. The students wrote computer notes
         and continued discussions with metacognitive reflections on the Knowledge Forum after class. The comparison
         class  was   instructed using    the typical   school  approach   with   teacher   explanation,    class  discussion  and
         demonstration of animations and PowerPoint presentations. The other contextual variables were controlled to be
         similar for both groups including use of the same instructional topics, same textbook and reference materials,
         and conducting same experiments. Students in Hong Kong need to do homework: the experimental students
         wrote on Knowledge Forum whereas the comparison students worked on short questions, essays & reports.
                   The instructional design followed earlier studies using knowledge building in Hong Kong classroom
         (Lee et al., 2006). A four-phase instructional design was used: (a) Developing a collaborative culture where
         students   were  asked  to  put  ideas to  the public;  (b)  Knowledge-building      inquiry:    Knowledge    Forum   was
         introduced   and   students engaged    in posing   problems,   making    conjectures    and hypotheses,   co-constructing
         explanations, comparing different theories and explanations; (c) Deepening and Rise-Above: students deepened
         their  understanding    using  rise-above    notes and  synthesized      their understanding;    and   (d) alignment    of
         assessment:  students   wrote  reflections and   e-portfolios  identifying  and  capturing   their own   and   community
         progress in knowledge building in their discourse.

        Measures
                   Epistemological   Beliefs  Questionnaire.   A questionnaire    of  28  items   was designed    based   on earlier
         work   for elementary   school   science  students (Conley    et al., 2004).   The scale  was    designed  to reflect four
         dimensions   of    epistemology   considered   important    to   science learning   including    "Certainty",    "Source",
         "Development" and "Justification". For scale development, pilot testing of items and interviews with experts
         and students were conducted for refining the scale. Then the questionnaire was administered to 270 students
         from Grades 7 to Grades 12. Factor analyses using Varimax rotation indicated three factors explaining 32.4% of
         variance, and the items correspond generally to what were expected on each dimension. Results indicated that
         items  of  Certainty and    Source load   on the same   factor   (Certainty-Source)     contributing 12.1%    of variance,

1-
Development     contributed    10.7%,   and    Justification contributed    9.6%.  Internal    consistency  of   scale   was
acceptable: Certainty-Source (13 items, D= 0.72), Development (7 items, D= 0.69) and Justification (8 items,
D=   0.68).  The  scale was    then administered   to  students  at pre and   posttests  to identify  their beliefs   and to
examine change.
         Conceptual-Change Questions. A paper and pencil test was administered to both classes to identify
conceptual   difficulties, and  to  assess students'   knowledge    structures   and understanding    of   the concepts   of
electrochemistry. The instrument consisted of open-ended items, multiple-choice and true/false items followed
by  giving   reasons for   the choices.  Items    were related  to  a) definitions of  redox    reactions,  b) reactions  in
electrochemical cells, c) flow of electric current, d) functions of a salt bridge, e) reactions in electrolytic cells, f)
identification of anode and cathode and their charges, g) working principle of zinc-carbon cell, h) cell potential,
i) half-cell equations  and    overall  redox  equations,  and  j) reactions  in  short-circuit cell. The   test items   was
validated by a university chemistry professor and an experienced chemistry teacher and piloted with 8 students.
The test took 40 minutes to complete. The responses for the open-ended items were categorized into four levels
of understanding.
         Examination     Questions.    We   also  collected   information   from   students'    examination    questions  in
chemistry from Grade 10 mid-year examination and Grade 10 final year examination. These questions can show
if students could attain knowledge in chemistry as expected in the public examination.
         Knowledge Forum Participation. Students' participation on Knowledge Forum was assessed using a
software called Analytic Toolkit (ATK) that accompanied Knowledge Forum (Burtis, 1998). The software used
server  log  data and   provided    quantitative   indices   of database    usage including    number   of  notes   written,
percentage of notes read, links to other notes, and use of scaffolds (thinking prompts), keywords and revisions.
Quantitative indices are useful to provide an overview of student engagement in the forum (Guzdial, 2000) and
ATK indices have been used in various studies on knowledge building to show student engagement (e.g., van
Aalst & Chan, 2007).
         Knowledge      Forum    Reflection.   Students   were   asked  to  write  about    what  they  have     learned  on
Knowledge    Forum    referring  to their  own    and  other students'  notes. They    were  provided   with   scaffolds  of
`theory-building' and'conceptual change' to help them reflect on how ideas are progressing and to help develop
metaconceptual awareness. These responses were coded on a 5-point scale from simplistic to complex responses
to track their  understanding.     This measure   was  based    on  earlier work  similar   to  e-portfolio that examined
students' engagement in knowledge building (Lee et al., 2006).
         Knowledge Inquiry Scores. Students' questions on Knowledge Forum were examined and coded using
a 5-point scale ranging from fragmented factual questions to general questions to explanatory questions. The
scale was based on research on epistemological focus and inquiry of knowledge building (Hakkarainen, 2002;
Lee  et al., 2006).  Inter-rater   reliability of Knowledge-Building        Reflection and  Inquiry   are   currently being
conducted.

RESULTS
Differences of Science Learning and Conceptual Change for Groups
Conceptual-Based and Examination-Based Questions
         Students'   conceptual    understandings    about   electrochemistry  were  assessed   using  the  overall written
pre- and post conceptual change tests. Analyses of pretest scores indicated that there was no difference between
classes suggesting similar knowledge levels. Analysis was conducted on gain scores and significant differences
on gain scores were obtained favoring the knowledge forum class (M = 37.08) over the comparison class (M=
31.44), t (77) = 2.08, p = .04, with medium effect size (K2 =.23). The results suggested that Knowledge building
students outperformed the comparison students on conceptual change scores in electrochemistry. Analyses of
students' pretest and posttest examination questions indicated no differences.

         Misconceptions and conceptual understanding
         The   content     analysis of  the    chemistry   achievement   pre-    and   posttest items  revealed     that  13
misconceptions on electrochemistry were identified. The misconception statements and their percentages of two
classes  before   and after    the  instruction  are  examined.    Overall,  both  classes   showed    decreases   and    the
Knowledge Forum students showed more decreases in several misconceptions.

       Differences of Epistemological Change for Groups
                  Epistemological beliefs were measured on the three dimensions with a 28-item instrument. Items were
         rated on a 5-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating more sophisticated beliefs (Table 2).

                  An independent sample t-test on pretest scores indicated no differences at pretest. Analyses of change
         in  epistemological   beliefs showed     that the  experimental   students  had  significantly   more  changes   than
         comparison    students (t (77)  =  4.75, p<.01)    on  overall scores.  Further analyses   indicated  that  significant
         differences were   found  on  certainty-source  (t (77)  = 4.47,  p<.01),  and  development   (t (77) =  5.48,  p<.01)
         indicating that Knowledge Building students made more changes from viewing knowledge as simplistic towards
         complex notions; and from seeing knowledge as static towards knowledge as extendable.

        Characterization of Knowledge Building Processes
        Participation Scores on Knowledge Forum (Quantitative Indices)
                  Preliminary analysis using the The Analytic Toolkit provided the degree of collaboration and pattern of
         social interactions among the students. There were 1024 notes written over the period of 4 months and the size
         of build-on trees included 97 small clusters (2-5 notes), 41 medium clusters (6-20 notes), 6 large clusters (21-40
         notes) and 2 very large clusters (over 40 notes). Students wrote an average of 25.6 notes in the period. Although
         there was   no   norm, these  ATK   participation  indices   indicated  high-level of  participation  and  interaction.
         Analyses also showed that there was a high level of density indicating much interactions. The ATK indices were
         combined using factor analysis and two factors were extracted: Factor 1 called Participation (notes created,
         scaffold uses and note revision) explained 35.29% of the variance, and Factor 2 called Collaboration (notes
         read, keyword use and notes linked) explained 30.59% of the variance.

        Reflection and Knowledge Building Portfolio
                  To illustrate how the knowledge-building approach may foster metaconceptual awareness, we provided
         an  example   of a student's  reflection posted   on  Knowledge   Forum.   The  quote  in  `parentheses'  is scaffolds
         (thinking prompts); we designed specific`conceptual-change' scaffolds in this study to foster metaconceptual
         awareness. The excerpt suggested that the student reflected on her puzzlement (uncertainty), noted earlier and
         current understanding,  considered   different  ideas;  used arguments  for reasoning   and  examined   various ideas
         posed by members of the community. Knowledge became an object of inquiry for analyses for developing a
         new understanding embedded in the social context of collective discourse.

        Photosynthesis and Respiration
                  What I think earlier... Bernice suggested that respiration is a redox reaction, but I doubted since in the
         chemical   equation I  could  not  see a transfer  of  oxygen  or electrons. C6H12O6       + 6O2  -->  6CO2    +6H2O
         Respiration is indeed a redox reaction (8 respiration as an example of redox reaction). (9 Photosynthesis) What I
         think now... We have to consider the alteration in oxidation numbers of the atoms instead of merely looking at
         the transfer of electrons or oxygen. The oxidation number of oxygen decreases from 0 to ­2. [reduction].The
         oxidation number of carbon increases from 0 to +4. [oxidation] Since photosynthesis is simply the reverse of
         respiration, it is also a redox reaction. (10 Photosynthesis and respiration ARE redox reactions)
                  Argument Apple suggested that there is a transfer of oxygen, so they are redox reactions. For the case
         of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide loses oxygen but gains hydrogen to form sugar and water loses hydrogen but
         gains oxygen. Hermia also thinks that they are redox reactions, and she (11 My guess to respiration as redox
         reaction) suggested that there might be other definitions of redox besides the transfer of electrons and oxygen.
         (12 PHOTOSYNTHESIS is a redox reaction!)
                  My new learning... I really gained a lot through this discussion, especially from Apple's explanation. It
         can be  considered  from  a   new  orientation. I  also learnt that the presence   of life depends   hugely  on redox
         reactions, since  respiration and  photosynthesis    are redox   reactions themselves.  I  also  found  that a  lot of

1-
biological changes  in   organisms  are  redox  reactions, and    this is a  new  discovery  for me.    An example
haemoglobin in blood gains oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin in oxygenated blood. The case of photosynthesis
and respiration motivated me to find out more examples of redox reactions in daily life. (Linda)

Relationships among Epistemological Beliefs, Knowledge Building and Conceptual
Change
Relationships Among Measures
         We  examined    the relationships  among     various measures    of  epistemological  beliefs, knowledge-
building reflection and conceptual change. Correlations indicated that epistemological beliefs were significantly
correlated with several pre and post- science learning measures (rs = .27 to .34, p<.05) suggesting that EB is
linked to science learning. Significant correlation were also observed between knowledge building reflection
(metaconceptual awareness) with pretest epistemological beliefs (r = .33, p<.05) and with post EB development
(rs = .36, p<.05). These findings suggest that students with more sophisticated beliefs are more likely to engage
in deeper  reflection. Further, there were  significant correlations   between knowledge   building  reflection  and
inquiry with conceptual change learning (rs =. 39-.46, p<.05). These finding indicate some positive correlations
among epistemological beliefs, metaconceptual awareness (reflection) and conceptual change.

Contribution of Knowledge Building Process to Conceptual Change and Belief Change
         To provide a more coherent picture, we examined the contribution of various measures to conceptual
change.  Hierarchical  regression analyses  were conducted    on   posttest conceptual-based  question  scores,  first
entering  pretest conceptual    question scores,   followed   by   knowledge    building reflection,    followed by
epistemological beliefs. Results indicated that prior conceptual-based scores was a significant predictor (R =.48)
that explains 23% of variance of posttest conceptual scores. When knowledge-building reflection was added to
the analyses, multiple R increased to .58 that explains another 10% of variance with significant change. When
epistemological beliefs were added, there were no increased variances explained. These findings indicate that
over and above prior knowledge, metaconceptual reflection on Knowledge Building contributed to conceptual
change. The same patterns of results were obtained when we used kb inquiry scores as the predictor.

We also examined epistemological belief as dependent variables to examine what would contribute to its
change. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that pretest epistemological beliefs was a significant predictor
(R = .51) explaining 26% of variance. We found that the quantitative knowledge-forum collaboration index
contributed to posttest EB over and above pretest beliefs. Students who participated on Knowledge Forum
with high collaboration activities (notes read, notes linked, and keywords) appeared to shift more to
sophisticated beliefs over and above pretest beliefs.

       Discussion
                  This study examined the roles of knowledge building on epistemological beliefs and conceptual change
         mediated by Knowledge Forum, a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. We first consider the
         effects of knowledge building approach on conceptual change and epistemological beliefs. We then consider
         explore  possible     interactions  of  epistemological     beliefs,  metaconceptual     awareness      and  socio-cognitive
         dynamics of knowledge building for bringing about conceptual change.

       Conceptual Change and Knowledge-Building
                  The first research question examined the instructional effects of knowledge building pedagogy on high-
         school  students'   scientific understanding     and   conceptual     change.  The  results   indicated   that  experimental
         students and comparison students had similar levels of prior knowledge and patterns of misconceptions before
         instruction.  After   instruction,  experimental    students   made    more   gains   than    the comparison     students   on
         conceptual-change     questions.   Detailed  analyses  of types    of misconceptions     indicated  that both   groups made
         improvement, but the experimental students reduced more misconceptions in electrochemistry. These findings
         support the increased emphasis on social construction of science knowledge, and specifically it supports the
         notion  that  collective knowledge     building  mediated   by  Knowledge      Forum     have positive   effects on  learning
         science Our results are consistent with earlier research on knowledge building discourse in elementary students'
         scientific understanding (Hakkarainen, 2004; Zhang et al., 2007). We extended earlier research to conceptual
         change  for  high-school    students in a   complex   domain   of  electrochemistry;     we   examined   conceptual   change
         more  systematically    designing   tasks  that  tapped   students'   misconceptions.    We    provided   some    preliminary
         evidence suggesting how knowledge-building involving progressive and problem-based inquiry in a community
         could possibly foster students' conceptual change.

       Nature and Change of Epistemological Beliefs
                  The    second   research  question    investigated the  nature    of students'   epistemological    beliefs, and   to
         examine the effects of knowledge building on epistemological beliefs with knowledge-building approach. We
         constructed   a scale  on   student epistemology    focusing   on    domain-specific   beliefs    about  chemistry;  such   an
         approach aligns with current emphasis of domain and context-specific beliefs. Three factors were identified
         including certainty-source, development, and justification; these factors are consistent with the ones identified
         with earlier research on epistemology (Conley et al., 2004 ). Comparison of pre- and posttests indicated that
         experimental    students made    more   shifts  on their  overall  epistemological     beliefs than     comparison   students;
         specifically, they  gained  more    shifts on  "certainty-source"     and  "development"    of knowledge,       indicating that
         experimental students now tend to view knowledge not as discrete facts but complex knowledge that does not
         only reside in external authority but can be constructed and derived from multiple sources. The findings also
         suggest that  knowledge-building       students are more    likely to  hold   the view   that knowledge      is not static but
         changeable and extendable over time.
                  Such   beliefs  seemed    highly   consistent with    the kinds   of beliefs  to  be  fostered   in a  collaborative
         knowledge-building community ­ When students work together to construct new understanding, they would be
         able to see   knowledge     as constructed     collaboratively and    that knowledge     can  be  advanced,     improved   and
         extended.  There   is considerable   work    on roles  of epistemological     beliefs in  science  learning  (e.g.,  Hofer  &
         Pintrinch, 2003). We extended current research examining how epistemological understanding may be changed
         over time with socio-cognitive dynamics of the knowledge-building environment.

       Knowledge Building, Epistemological Beliefs, and Conceptual Change
                  The    third research   question    examined   the   nature  of   knowledge     building  and   the interactions   of
         epistemological   beliefs,  knowledge   building    process,   and   conceptual   change.   We    first assessed  knowledge
         building process to examine students' engagement in reflective and intentional learning on Knowledge Forum.
         Using   quantitative  indices  derived  from    Analytic  Toolkit,    we   found  that   students  were   generally   actively
         involved in Knowledge Forum. Although there were no norms for online forum involvement, the quantitative
         indices as   compared    to common     patterns  of  online   forum   (Lipponenen     et al., 2003)     suggest that students
         working on this Knowledge Forum were participating actively; such interactions and collaboration on the forum
         would be needed to provide the foundation for students to work together for deep reflection.

1-
         We   also   used   other  qualitative    indices including     `reflection   notes'  to  probe    into  students'
metaconceptual awareness. As the excerpt showed, students were prompted to reflect on their puzzlement and
gaps of understanding; they referred to arguments and evidence to help them revise their understanding; and
they reflected on new understanding. These reflection notes are similar to our design of e-portfolio that served
both purposes of assessment for tracking and scaffolding knowledge-building (see van Aalst & Chan, 2007).
When   working     on   Knowledge    Forum,     students  were    engaged   in    co-constructing     and  revising    their
understanding; these reflection helped to capture the knowledge-building process. Students were reflecting on
individual understanding in the context of how others have helped them understand; their reflection notes also
provided  the kind   of  knowledge   artefacts  for improvement    of  understanding.    These   reflection  suggest   how
students  were   developing     metaconceptual    awareness    reflecting  on    the  relations  between    their  `naïve'
conceptions and new understanding and deepening their epistemology supported in the social context.
         The third research question also examined the relationships among epistemology, knowledge building
engagement    and  reflection,  and  conceptual   change.   Epistemological      beliefs  were  correlated   with  several
measures of pre- and post-test exam and conceptual-change question scores. We also found that students with
more sophisticated beliefs were engaged in deeper reflection and inquiry. These patterns are consistent with
current research on roles of epistemological beliefs on learning and conceptual change (e.g., Mason & Scirica,
2006; Qian   & Alvermann,    2000;   Sinatra   &  Pintrich, 2003).   When   different   variables were    examined  using
regression analyses, knowledge-building reflection significantly predicted conceptual change over and above
effects of prior knowledge. Epistemological beliefs were not a significant predictor after controlling for prior
knowledge. The same patterns were obtained using a different knowledge-building measure `inquiry'. These
findings   suggest   the  important  role    of   knowledge-building     process     contributing  to  deep     conceptual
understanding. When students inquire and reflect on their understanding in the context of community knowledge
they may advance in their individual and group learning that predicted subsequent posttest conceptual change.
         For  epistemological   change,  it  is interesting to  note  that the   extent  to which    students  engaged  in
Knowledge Forum collaborative activity (reading and linking more notes) contributed to belief change. It is
possible that students who read more and made more links and references to others' notes might see knowledge
as more complex and extendable. Although epistemological beliefs were not a predictor of conceptual change
probably  due  to  the  limited time of  instruction, the   patterns of  results  are generally   consistent  with results
indicating relations   of beliefs  with reflection   both illustrating  goal-directed    intentional  learning  strategies.
Currently, we  are conducting     interviews to  probe  more   deeply  into the   nature  of epistemological    change  to
understand more about its relations with metaconceptual awareness and conceptual change.

Implications, Future Directions and Conclusions
         These findings suggest an emerging picture of how knowledge building may foster conceptual change
with  evolving metaconceptual      and  epistemological   shifts. We    propose   that   knowledge    building  may    help
integrate cognitive and social perspectives of learning (Vosniadou, 2007); it emphasizes objectified knowledge
that can  be examined,    revised, and  improved    with  the collective  efforts of  the community.    We    investigated
students'  cognitive understanding   and   shifts in  misconceptions;    we also    emphasized    the role  of  social and
discursive discourse as students engaged in collaborative inquiry on the forum Further, analyses of student's
reflection suggest how individual and collective aspects of learning can be integrated mediated by progressive
discourse. Students   were  reflecting  on how    naïve  conceptions   can be  revised   with  new   information   as  they
pondered on the relations of old and new understanding. Their reflections are contextualized as they enculturate
the practice of a community of scientists. Their reflections and metaconceptual awareness go beyond individual
but involves "social metacognition" as students reflect on both personal and community understanding. Their
evolving knowledge can be objectified and examined and fostered as they participate, interact, and enculturate
into the practice of a knowledge building community..
         In conclusion, this study employed a knowledge-building framework to examine and to foster cognitive
and epistemological changes scaffolded in a knowledge-building environment. Our findings shed light on the
nature of beliefs and how they may be modified over time with knowledge building approach. We showed how
the design of computer-supported knowledge building environment may have positive effects on conceptual and
epistemological changes, and we showed the contribution of metaconceptual awareness to conceptual change.
Knowledge Building is an instructional approach that may scaffold conceptual change; and it also provides the
environment   that may    provide  rich data for  investigating how    change    in epistemology,    intentional learning,
metaconceptual awareness interact with conceptual change.
