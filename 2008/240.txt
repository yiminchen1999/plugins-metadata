                  Abstract:  This paper explores the use of Engle and Conant's (2002) theoretical framework of
                  productive disciplinary engagement to describe a group of fifth-graders' emergent dialogical
                  argumentation about a rocky seashore ecosystem that was triggered by fieldwork activities.
                  Engle and Conant's theoretical framework was mapped onto Weinberger and Fischer's (2006)
                  multi-dimensional conceptual framework for CSCL-based argumentation in order to guide the
                  selection of analytical approaches that would holistically assess students' argumentation along
                  four  dimensions    (i.e. participation, formal   argumentative     structure, social  modes   of co-
                  construction of knowledge and epistemic reasoning). The application of these complementary
                  analyses  enabled   the    exploration   of  the  effects  of   the different   dimensions   and  the
                  identification of instances of students' more productive argumentation of Science ideas in the
                  Knowledge Forum (KF) platform.

        Introduction
                  Current  literature emphasizes     the   importance    of defining    meaningful  science   learning  within  a
         discourse of human agency (Fusco & Barton, 2001) that goes beyond telling learners about a discipline (Barab
         & Hay, 2001).   Traditional approaches tend to over-emphasize the passive learning of science facts (i.e. learning
         about science content). Hence, various research studies (e.g. Scardamalia 2004; Engle & Conant, 2002) have
         focused on the creation of learning environments to facilitate students to "learn to be scientists" in articulating
         and improving their own ideas about scientific phenomena. Engagement in the first-hand processes to explore
         questions, communicate science ideas, collect data to answer questions, form explanations based on data and
         generate conclusions  (i.e.  learning to  be scientists)   is critical for students to  truly understand   the nature of
         "doing" science (Driver, Newton & Osborne, 2000).
                  Fostering a  learning     environment  for   students  to "learn   to be   scientists" and engage    in science
         discussions to  productively  use    and  generate   scientific knowledge    is never   easy.   Studies (e.g.  Lipponen,
         Rahikainen, Hakkarainen, & Palonen, 2002; Bielaczyc, 2006) in the literature have documented the challenges
         (e.g. the lack of sustained and high quality discussion of science ideas among students) and issues (e.g. teacher
         readiness and student readiness) in enacting such educational endeavours, especially with the use of Information
         and Communication Technology (ICT) tools. In order for "school discussions to provide powerful contexts for
         practising and learning new reasoning behaviour", the conditions of "starting from common experience, having
         a very problematic object of discussion, and changing the rules of school discourse when the teacher is leading
         the group" must be present (Pontecorvo, 1993, p.365). Furthermore, Bielaczyc (2006, p. 322) indicated that
         existing research should move from adopting the "best-practices" and "sanitized" approach in highlighting the
         end states of achieving optimal uses of the ICT tool towards specifying the implementation paths or trajectories
         that are "progressive set of phases that teachers need to move through with their students to progress from initial
         to effective use of a technology-based tool."
                  Hence, this paper seeks to understand fifth-graders' engagement in the first implementation trajectory
         of an exploratory study to intertwine online discussions in the Knowledge Forum (KF) platform with fieldwork
         activities at a rocky seashore ecosystem. Could these activities be successfully implemented to "go against the
         grain" of regular IRE-based (Initiation, Response, Evaluation) classroom functioning?             To what extent would
         the juxtaposition  of fieldwork    experiences    and KF   discussions     motivate these students   to take   increasing
         responsibility for developing      their ideas,   theories and   explanations    in  the  light  of fresh  observations
         (Scardamalia,  2004)  and   hence,  progress towards    higher   levels  of  engagement   in  the KF  space?   As  many
         progressive implementation paths or trajectories will be needed to move students from IRE-based classroom
         discourse towards the social construction of science knowledge, what would be an appropriate framework to
         document the developmental progress that students make in this transition? This paper explores the use of Engle
         and Conant's (2002) theoretical framework of productive disciplinary engagement to describe how students had
         been engaged in "learning to be scientists" through their participation in the KF and fieldwork activities.

       Theoretical Framework of Productive Disciplinary Engagement
                  According to Duschl, Schweingruber and Shouse (2007, p. 194), engagement with science "begins with
         willingness to participate in the science classroom, but it must go beyond simply participating to participating in

ways  that  advance    science  learning".  Engle   and   Conant's  (2002)  theoretical  framework    of   productive
disciplinary engagement (see Table 1) was utilized for my exploratory study as it emphasized the need to look
for evidence  of students'  engagement     that went  beyond   mere participation. That  is, participation had    to be
sufficiently disciplinary and productive to advance science learning.

 demonstrated change over time in student         scientific content and            students actively speaking,
 investigations, complexity of                    experimental activities           listening, responding, and
 argumentation and use of previous                (including argumentation          working with high levels of
 investigations to generate new questions,        based on logic and data           on-task behaviour
 new concepts, and new investigations             patterns)

         How    would  Engle    and  Conant's    framework    be  useful  for  my  exploratory  study?     Firstly,  its
differentiation  between   engagement,     disciplinary   engagement    and   productive  disciplinary   engagement
sensitized  the researcher to  different aspects  of  engagement   that  could be  achieved  within the  progressive
implementation paths or trajectories to provide a finer-grained description of students' transition from initial to
more effective ways of socially constructing science knowledge in the KF platform. For example, the extent of
productive disciplinary engagement in an initial implementation path could be described in terms of low student
engagement (i.e. low KF participation) or high engagement in non-disciplinary ways (i.e. high KF participation
that did not advance science understanding due to the large number of unanswered questions). Secondly, Engle
and Conant's framework emphasized classroom discourse as an important data source that would more directly
measure student engagement (e.g. Nystrand and Gamoran, 1991; Herrenkohl and Guerra, 1998), as compared to
the use of self-report questionnaires and lesson observation in prior research. Analysis of the KF discourse data
that enabled the tracing of "the moment-by-moment development of new ideas and disciplinary understandings
as  they unfold  in real-life settings"  (Engle  and  Conant,  p. 403)   would illuminate ways   in which   students
collaborated productively/unproductively to co-construct science ideas in the KF space. Such an understanding
of  student processes  could   not be   derived  solely  from the static comparisons  of  students'   pre- and    post-
measures.   Thirdly,  Engle   and  Conant's   framework    of  productive  disciplinary  engagement    provided      the
flexibility for the researcher to define what constituted disciplinary and productive engagement based on the
conceptions of the disciplines, the specific tasks and topics and the specific groups of students and hence, it
could potentially serve as a useful frame for any research that aimed to foster student discussions.
         For my exploratory study, the dialogical argumentative aspects in the KF discourse emerged during
students'  KF   discussion of  selected  questions    on the  rocky shore   ecosystem  that  required  them    to take
oppositional positions (Foo & Looi, 2006). Argumentation was not taught explicitly during the project duration.
Dialogical argumentation refers to arguments that are co-constructed in a collaborative effort among two or
more students or arguments that are produced by an individual student, but take into account other students'
statements,  either to support  or  to   contradict them   (Jimenez-Aleixandre    & Pereiro-Munoz,     2005).  These
students' KF postings, being the predominant collaborative group discourse, were analyzed to determine the
extent of productive disciplinary engagement. The specific research questions (see Column 2 of Table 2) which
served as the identifying features to determine the extent of productive disciplinary engagement (see Column 1
of Table 2) are (1) What were the participation patterns among students?         (2) What were the argumentation
patterns among students? (3) How had arguments become more sophisticated?

Use of Weinberger and Fischer's Multi-dimensional Conceptual Framework for
CSCL-based Argumentation to assess Productive Disciplinary Engagement
         Engle and Conant's framework was constrained in that it did not specifically explicate how to assess
online argumentation. Hence, Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) conceptual framework (see Column 3 of Table
2) was used to provide the critical dimensions needed for the analysis of online argumentation. The consonance
between Weinberger and Fischer's multiple process dimensions and Engle and Conant's productive disciplinary
engagement enabled the mapping of the two frameworks, as shown in Table 2, so as to guide the selection of the
analytical  approaches  (see  Column     4 of   Table 2)  for the exploratory  study. In  contrast  with   the earlier
argumentation studies for teaching and learning of science (e.g. Kelly, Drucker & Chen, 1998) that primarily
focused on the use of single process dimensions (e.g. Toulmin's argument structure, 1958), Weinberger and
Fischer's  conceptual  framework   ensured   the holistic assessment  of online  argumentation  along  the  different
dimensions of participation, formal argumentative structure, social modes of co-construction of knowledge and
epistemic reasoning (Clark, Sampson, Weinberger & Erkens, 2007).

                                                                                                                     2     1-1

         argumentation in the KF space. In order to analyze the participation patterns (RQ1), the Analytic Toolkit (ATK)
         afforded by the KF platform was utilized to provide the relevant statistics (e.g. number of notes written/read) on
         students' participation patterns.

 Level 5:  Extended arguments

          In terms of the argumentation patterns (RQ2), students' KF postings were individually coded using
Toulmin's Argument Pattern (TAP) which anchored most of the existing argumentation studies (e.g. Erduran,
Simon   &  Osbourne,   2004).  From     the TAP  perspective,  the stronger   arguments   should   contain more   of the
structural components    (e.g. claim,   data, warrants, backings,  rebuttal   and qualifier) than  weaker   arguments.
However, the use of TAP had its methodological problems. To more reliably code single arguments using TAP,
Toulmin's   data, warrants  and  backings    were collapsed into   the single category  of "grounds"     (Erduran et al,
2004). As Toulmin's TAP was more suited to examining single arguments (Kelly et al, 1998), Erduran et al's
analytic  method  had  to  be  utilized to  examine  longer argument    sequences  (e.g.  claim   versus counter-claim,
extended   arguments   with rebuttals)  in  order to categorize  them   into  different levels  of argumentation   (see
Column 1 of Table 3). The assumption behind Erduran et al's analytical method was that the rebuttal in the
higher levels (i.e. Levels 4-5) played a significant role in raising the quality of the argument by "forcing both
participants to evaluate the validity and strength of that argument" (p. 921) which otherwise would not have
occurred.
          In terms of whether arguments became more sophisticated over time (RQ3), the focus was to evaluate
the arguments on the basis of their collaborative value in contributing to the conversation rather than solely on
the development of normative science concepts (Grice, 1975). Gunawardena et al's coding scheme (see Column
2 of Table 3) was used to determine the "extent learners refer to contributions of their learning partners" by
operating on the reasoning of their peers to move from lower to higher mental functions (i.e. Phases 1 to 5)
rather than  "make    contributions  to  the  argumentative   discourse  without  reference    to  other contributions"
(Weinberger & Fischer, 2006, p. 78). Gunawardena et al's coding scheme was chosen as it was able to track the
progression of ideas in accordance to phases. Finally, Chan's coding scheme (2001) was used to understand why
certain argumentative sequences became more sophisticated. Unlike other researchers (e.g. Jimenz-Aleixandre,
M., Rodriguez, A., & Duschl, R., 2000), Chan went beyond the content domain to define students' epistemic
operations (see Column 3 of Table 3) in terms of how they would process new information (i.e. problem-centred
or surface  moves)    from peers to  collaboratively  construct  arguments,    especially in encountering   unfamiliar
discussion topics. According to Bereiter (1992), students who took the problem-centred approach were more
likely to  view   the new  or  contradictory   information  in their   peers' arguments   as problematic    and hence,
formulated more questions of inquiry or explanations to resolve these problematic areas. Though these students'
explanations might    be inaccurate,  they   would be able  to detect  "anomalies   in  upcoming   information  and   to
revise their models continually" (Chan, 2001, p. 29).

Discussion
Tables 4 and 5 showed a subset of the students' argumentative KF postings that discussed the differentiation of
plants, animals and living things at the rocky seashore. Table 4 started with P5 (L80) externalizing his claim
about the characteristics that differentiated a plant (i.e. green and should not move) from an animal (i.e. moving
around) at the rocky seashore. It was evident that P5 had drawn upon his prior knowledge of land animals and
plants to put forth his claim for the seashore context. This was a typical starting point for most of the arguments
on the characteristics of seashore plants and animals. The multiple rebuttals served to get students to clarify the
source and extent of their disagreements, resulting in the restating of positions by a few students. For example,
in lines 84 ­ 92, the students explored the different ideas they had about the movement of seashore animals.         In
line 84, P2 knew that the sea anemone was an animal and yet found it incongruent that it did not seem to move.
However, this claim was rebutted by P5 who elaborated on the sliding movement of the sea anemone. This led
P11 and P2 to highlight how the movements of land animals and seashore animals were different. P9's rebuttal
also served to explicate that movement had to be controlled by the organisms.

Table 5 showed how the students' later arguments became more sophisticated through moving from Phase 2 to
Phases 3 - 5. P8 started by summarizing the key agreements on the characteristics of "plant", "animal" and
"living things" that were mentioned by her peers in their previous arguments      through the use of qualifiers. P8's
synthesis of ideas was considered to be a very high mental function as it was indicative of her uptake of prior
ideas contributed by her peers. Other students started to test the "soundness" of P8's proposed synthesis. P9
used the the velcro crab as an example of a seashore organism which could not be considered as a plant even
though it had plants growing on it more for the purpose of camouflage.      It was also becoming evident to some of
the students that physical and behavioural characteristics alone might not be sufficient to determine whether an
organism was a plant or an animal.   In addition to these attributes, P6 indicated the importance of the biological
process of making food in order for the organism to qualify as a plant. Students' productive arguments resulted
from their problem-centred moves that operated on each other's reasoning to develop their ideas.

         levels of Phases   3-5   (Agreement/Application      of  newly   constructed   meaning).     Hence,   the  arguments  had

       Concluding Remarks
         The application    of    the complementary      analytic approaches      (i.e. Erduran   et  al's  levels  of  arguments,
         Gunawardena et al's Interaction Model Analysis, Chan's surface and problem-centred discourse moves) on a
         subset of  students'   KF    discussions  provided   evidence    to determine    the  extent of   productive  disciplinary
         engagement    that occurred    in the  first  implementation   trajectory   of an  exploratory  study   to intertwine  KF
         discussions with fieldwork activities. Taking the structural perspective of argumentation alone (which anchored
         most of the existing argumentation studies) or doing frequency counts of categories might not have sufficed to
         provide   new   insights in  terms  of how    students had  been   developing   their arguments   in  the  KF  space. The
         complementary use of Gunawardena et al's Interaction Model Analysis and Chan's surface and problem-centred
         discourse  facilitated   greater  understanding   of   students'   sense-making    efforts  in action   that  led to more
         productive co-construction of arguments in the KF space.
