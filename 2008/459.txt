         Abstract:    Our  research  focused   on the analysis  of  face-to-face  (FTF) social   interaction of
         groups working on maths problems using the GCC framework in traditional classroom setting.
         The   GCC    framework     requires students  to  analyze   maths  problems   with  "solutions"  that
         contained    conceptual    or  oversight  errors,  critique  these   solutions    with  mathematical
         arguments, and finally fix the "solutions" collaboratively. In this study, the GCC framework is
         extended to the VMT chat medium which consists of a shared whiteboard, chat message box
         and   tools  for students  to  construct  mathematical     representations.  The   analyses  of these
         sessions were based on the Collaboration Interaction Model (CIM), a model designed to study
         the knowledge construction process of complex chat transcripts. This paper will discuss how
         participants   mediate    shared   understanding   of   mathematical     representations  and   form
         mathematical arguments to construct new knowledge in the chat medium, using the CIM as
         the key instrument of analysis.

Introduction
         The objective of education is to prepare students beyond school, as well as to teach them to apply
concepts  and  skills   learned in  school  to  problems  faced  in their   everyday  lives (Verzoni,  1997).   It is not
uncommon to see engineers coming together to analyze an engineering problem, a group of specialist doctors
collaborating as a team to diagnose a complicated symptom or a team technicians attempting to locate a fault in
the pipeline. Typically under such circumstances, there is often a situation with a "solution" presented to the
team. The team is to fix this "solution" by locating and correcting faults embedded in the "solution" itself. There
is an increasing   need   for our  students  to be equipped    with  not only   problem solving   skills but  with   fault
detection skills in  a  knowledge-based     economy.  The   solution  of  a problem   does  not  always  require   a fully
constructed  solution,  rather  the "solutions"   presented at  times are   often distorted  and  the analysis  of   such
problems with "solutions" requires adequate metacognitive skills to detect the fault, monitor the progress of the
fault and perform    the  appropriate  adjustment  (Clark   &  Mayer,  2003).   Thus  one   challenge for mathematics
educators    today will   be  to  utilize existing  mathematics     curriculum   in  school  to  design  problems     for
accommodating such learning needs.
         Technology     can   serve  as   a tool,  offering opportunities    to  integrate  peer interaction  with    the
construction of artifacts for facilitating collaborative knowledge construction. Peer interaction plays a significant
role in collaborative learning (Vygotsky, 1978; Wertsch, 1985; Harasim, 1990; Baker, Jensen & Kolb, 2002)
where students appropriate understanding of situations by constructing their knowledge, by acting upon it and
by making their own interpretations. Conversation is a tool used in such exchanges between peers, enabling
ideas to being further built and developed (Duffy & Cunningham, 1996; Christiansen & Dirckinck-Holmfeld,
1995). Appropriate pedagogies need to be devised to enable the effective use of computer-mediated resources.
Indeed, educators have been urged to revamp their pedagogy in order to take advantage of the new opportunities
offered by computer technologies in contrast to traditional classroom assignments, laboratory work and other
face to face (F2F) methods (Laurillard, 2002; Godwin, Thorpe & Richardson, 2008). One such technology is the
quasi-synchronous text chat, used by several studies (Garcia & Jacobs, 1999; Romiszowski & Mason, 1997) as a
medium    to facilitate computer-mediated      discourse. Learners  access  the  chat software   through  a  network   of
computers    connected   through  a server  to  communicate    and  co-construct  knowledge    geographically   apart. A
quasi-synchronous     environment   allows   participants   to read,  interpret  and  construct  messages    in  textual/
diagrammatic representations (rather than hearing them). They lack the audio and visual cues that are found in
FTF interaction.   The responses are not visible to participants until the "enter" key is pressed, not permitting any
reaction from other participants until the message is externalized on the chat (Garcia & Jacobs, 1998).
         This research proposes the use of the Guided Collaborative Critique (GCC) Framework (Wee, 2007)
and computer technology such as the chat environment to help students reinforce and develop mathematical
reasoning through the GCC online activity. This activity is designed for students to identify and rationalize their
identification of  errors detected  within   the  proposed  mathematical    solution, and   to  collaboratively  explore

                                                                                                                             2-
         approaches to remedy the errors. Subsequent sections will elaborate further on the implementation of the GCC
         in a quasi-synchronous chat environment (the VMT chat system) and the use of the CIM (Wee & Looi, 2007) to
         analyze knowledge construction patterns in chat interaction.

        Guided Collaborative Critique Framework
                  Several studies have supported the use of Collaborative Critiques (e.g., Lewis, Perry & Murata, 2003;
         Swan, 2006; Cathey, 2007) as an effective learning process for participants during collaboration.      For example,
         Cathey (2006) reported the effectiveness online collaborative peer critique on an assignment. The concept of
         Guided Collaborative Critique (GCC) is derived from above mentioned studies and complements traditional
         methods of mathematical problem solving where students construct knowledge via reading the problem and
         solving it from scratch. "Guided" refers a sequence of structured steps to aid students in the analysis of the
         problem. "Collaborative"    emphasizes  use   of dialogue  in the group solving    process  to construct knowledge.
         "Critique"  is associated   with the  group's  negotiation ability  to locate   errors embedded    in the  proposed
         "solution", to build an argument collaboratively to substantiate their identification of the error(s) and to defend
         the validity of the proposed argument. In the context of this research, an error is defined as a representation
         identified as mathematically inappropriate in the "proposed solution".

                  The Guided Collaborative Critique Framework (see figure 1) consists of two phases: GCC Problem
         Design and GCC Technique.       The latter is a proposed problem solving method employed by students while the
         former emphasizes the teacher's design of the GCC problem. The implementation of the GCC Technique will be
         explained in the next section. The GCC Problem Design is formulated through the construction of the Error
         Table (see table 1 for typical student errors in junior college mathematics in Singapore), and is designed to assist
         teachers in rationalizing   frequent conceptual  issues (errors) encountered    by students and  incorporating     these
         issues in the problem design.

                         r!                                                 r!

                                                              negative.

          The Error Table is compiled from the consensus and perspectives of a group of teachers. The first
column in the Error Table describes the errors to be implemented in the problem design. The second column
explains  the  rationale behind  the       error. Following   the construction   of the                         Error Table,   the problem  and  the
proposed "solution" are designed, and then iteratively reviewed to ensure the quality of test. The next section
elaborates further on the GCC mathematics problem in the chat environment.

GCC Activity and the GCC Technique
          The  participants  collaboratively        work  on  a  GCC    activity under                          the  topic  of binomial  series. All
participants logged onto their terminals at a designated time allocated by the instructor and were geographically
apart. The overview of the activity is as follows:

                Expand   (3  x)2 as        a series of ascending powers  of x, up to                          and including the term in
                x3, expressing the coefficients in their simplest form.        State the range of values of x
                for which the expansion is valid. Find also the coefficient of x25 in the form                                 k
                                                                                                                               3m
               where k and m are constants to be found.

          Embedded   in  the  "proposed         solution" are three common     errors                          found in assignments.  The   students
were instructed to work collaboratively in their group to identify any mistakes in the proposed solution and to
follow four steps known as the GCC Technique to solve the problem.
Step 1: First read the question and the proposed solution. Use the VMT drawing tool to circle any error/fault
identified in the proposed solution on the whiteboard.
Step 2: Explain using mathematical evidence (formula, concept, and proof) how your group identified the circle
term as an error/fault. Working is to be shown in the          VMT chat room.
Step 3: If any error/fault is identified, work out the solution to amend the error/fault found in the proposed
solution.
Step 4: Reflect on the steps your group has taken to identify the error/fault under the Summary whiteboard.
          GCC Technique is adapted from Polya's four-stage model of problem solving (Polya, 1952). The steps
are designed to guide students to work collaboratively to externalize mathematical representations appropriately

                                                                                                                                                        2-
         during discourse, to scaffold students in analyzing and solving the problem, and to conclude the session with a
         post-problem solving reflection.

        Participants and Affordances of Chat Environment
                  Our  target groups    are   16-17  year  old junior college    students.  They    have a   basic  foundation   in
         mathematics   and  are among     the top  20%   of the   cohort  in terms  of  academic    ability. A   total of 7  groups
         consisting of three college students collaboratively solved the maths problem (see figure 2) in VMT-Chat.

                                        Figure 2. Interface of VMT chat room: Workspace Tab.

                  Figure 2 shows the interface of the VMT chat room under the Workspace Tab accessible by members
         of the group. The maths problem is placed on the shared whiteboard by the teacher.             The chat line is used as a
         platform for  students to  converse   synchronously.   The  students    used  the  toolbar to  construct artifacts  on the
         shared whiteboard. For example, one student drew a circle over the maths symbol "3" (see figure 2), linking
         with a line connected with an arrow to the text symbol "3^-2", illustrating the amendment to the error identified.

        Methods and Data Collection
                  In  this study,   a segment   of  the  chat  transcript  between    3  college students    solving   the   Guided
         Collaborative  Critique  (GCC)     problem   (see  table 4) is   analyzed. The    chat transcript   is  created  using the
         VMTplayer, a recorder that reproduces the session as it was experienced by the students. The VMTplayer plays
         back the entire   session,  capturing the  moment     to moment     interaction between    the students    as they  posted
         messages in the chat line and manipulated artifacts on the shared whiteboard. The messages are then coded into
         contribution units denoting a logical unit of meaning. A contribution number is analogous to the speaker taking
         the turn in conversation analysis (Sacks, Schegloff & Jefferson, 1974). Messages can be interrupted by any
         participants since visual   or auditory   cues are not   visible to the students   in such  environments.      When such
         interruptions occur, the   logical   unit will be  separated into   two  contribution   numbers.       The  Collaboration
         Interaction Model (CIM) is constructed based on the coded messages in the chat segment (table 2) to increase
         the reliability of relationships between the contribution nos. There is a probability that messages arrive out of
         sequence or   responses  may   not have   an adjacency   relationship.  An   additional tool   known    as the   Individual
         Uptake  Descriptor   Table   (IUDT)   is  designed  for  researchers  to  understand   the  rationale   of each   message
         constructed  from  the student's   perspectives   towards  triangulation   of  the interpretations   of the   relationships
         between  the  messages   in  the CIM.   Given  the tight  school  curriculum,   the   students were    required  to submit
         within 24 hours after the completion of VMT session. The methodology of the CIM and concepts of the IUDTs
         will not be elaborated in this paper (see Wee & Looi. 2007 for more information on the CIM and IUDTs). For
         the purpose of this work, the IUDTs are applied in construction of the CIM (see figure 3).

   Yvonne    no.... that first part is wrong ler                                                                              C12
   Wane      then the modules x more than 3 is wrong                                                                          C13
   Wane      it should be less than
   William   first take out the 3                                                                                             C14
   Yvonne    when he take out constant, it will not be 3                                                                      C15
   Yvonne    cos it's 3^-2
   William   yeah. coz there is a a power to -2                                                                               C16
   Yvonne    but the rest of the steps i'm not very sure                                                                      C17
   William   so the second line is not correct                                                                                C18

   Wane      i over look it
   William   but should take out the a.                                                                                       C30
   Yvonne    ok.... for the next part... did your spot any error?                                                             C31
   William   coz -2 is a negative value                                                                                       C32

   Wane      wait
   William   i mean if the power is a negative value. it should use(1+ax)to power of n                                        C38
   Yvonne    ya... that's why they took out the common factor                                                                 C39

          Conscious Effect of Situations
                       The GCC is designed to promote awareness of embedded conceptual errors in maths problem. This is
           known       as the Conscious    Effect of Situations.   Through    negotiation     (argumentation     and agreement)    of  errors,
           students     will  become    aware  of  possibility    of encountering  such       errors   in similar  problem.  Let's   take the
           following example to illustrate how the Conscious Effect of Situations is realized during the discourse. The chat
           segment     shows   that Wane    missed   out  the first  error 3§¨©1 x3 ·2 ¸¹ , identified the second   error  x !1      x !3  in3
           stage 2 (refer to CIM), and proposed that the first part of the solution was free of errors [C10] (refer to table 2)
           leading to a rejection from Yvonne. She claimed that there was indeed an error in the first part of the proposed
           solution [C12]. At stage 4 (refer to CIM), Yvonne explained the need for "3" to have "the power of -2" [C16],
           and    drew    a circle over "3"  of 3§¨©1 x3 ·2 ¸¹ to reference the  location     of the   error. William  supported     Yvonne's
           proposal [C16] for the need of the "power of -2" [C16]. At stage 5, Wane continued to insist that "3" was correct
           [C22], rejecting claims by William and Yvonne. Wane constructed the formula "a power n ( 1+ bx/a) power n"
           [C33] after several chat exchanges with Yvonne and William [C23 to C32] at stage 6, which is coherent with
           the ideas that William and Yvonne attempting to explain to Wane in stage 4 and stage 5. The negotiation of
           errors between the three students assisted Wane in realizing what he had missed in the first part of the proposed
           solution,    hence  creating  the  awareness   of   the   need  to be  cautious      of such   mathematical   conceptual    errors.
           Although       William  and  Yvonne    have   shown     to understand   the      nature of  the  error, the  articulation  process
           undertaken enforced their consciousness of such mathematical situations.

          Conceptual Reinforcement
                       The GCC is structured for students to investigate the "proposed" solution sequentially (the logical flow
           of manipulating mathematical expressions and symbols) through dialogue and external resources such as their
           notes     and  assignments   in  order to reinforce    mathematical    concepts.      Conceptual   reinforcement   is   a dialectic
           process between the students where representations are interpreted, co-constructed and manipulated. Let's take
           the following example to illustrate how this dialectic process reinforced Wane's mathematical concepts. Stage 1
           shows William responding "it's a binomial series" [C4] to Wane's question "do u remember tt formula we learnt
2-         in secondary school?"[C3].         Wane's question was also uptaken by Yvonne reply "can enlighten me?" [C11].
This indicates that the group members were not sure of the binomial expansion formula used to analyse the
problem. Binomial expansion was taught with the power "n" was positive in secondary school but the GCC
problem indicated n as negative 3§¨©1 x3 ·2 ¸¹ hence it was not appropriate to directly apply what was learned in
secondary school to problem. Yvonne raised this concern "I not sure cause it's power to -2" [C9]. This issue was
not only unresolved but invited strong reaction from members when Wane proposed the formula "(a+bx) power
n" [C27]. William uptook Wane's proposal "(a+bx) power n" [C27], explaining that " 'a' needs to be taken out
because -2 is a negative value" [C30, C32] and rejecting the use of the formula [C34].            Wane proposed "the
formula is   'a' power   n (1+   bx/a) ower  n" [C33],   (typo mistake   of 'ower'  as 'power'), and    indicated  that he
appropriated William and Yvonne's explanations (see stage 5 and stage 6). Wane responded "what???" [C35]
when William proposed that his formula could not be used [C34] indicated that he had attempted to rationalize
the application of "the formula is 'a' power n (1+ bx/a) ower n" [C33], not realizing that William's proposal
[C34] was actually referring to "(a+bx) power n" [C27].        Wane's mathematical concepts was reinforced when
his proposal "(a+bx) power n" [C27] was re-constructed to" 'a' power n (1+ bx/a) power n", it became clear that
his understanding shifted from applying the formula to cases where power n as positive to cases where power n
is negative.

Mathematical Reasoning
        The      GCC  aims   to develop  student's mathematical   reasoning    through   the process  of justification  of
errors. The stages in the CIM represent how students attempt to make sense of other another. Mathematical
reasoning can be illustrated using three cases from stage 5: The first case: Yvonne is reasoning out "take out
constant, it will not be 3, cos it's 3^-2" [C15] when William proposed "first take out the 3" [C14]. The second
case: William attempted to reject Wane's proposal "that 3 is correct" [C22] with "no. that 3 should also to the
power of 3" [C34], indicating that a power was required. The third case: Wane explained to Yvonne why he
thought she was wrong to propose "take out constant, it will not be 3, cos it's 3^-2" [C15].          Wane constructed
"(a+bx) power n" [C27] to substantiate his point. Although not all the cases appropriated correct mathematical
reasoning (only the first two cases are correct), the GCC problem design assists students in making sense of
mathematical     situations, engage their  prior knowledge     on the   topic  and  through  dialogue   achieve   a better
understanding of mathematics.

Dual Feedback
        The      dual feedback   process   informs student on  the depth    of their conceptual   understanding     of  the
problem, allowing them review their notes, assignment and tutorials to learn at that instance and the teacher of
the group's ability in the problem. Teacher's talk in the classroom is often reflected in the student's discourse.
That is to say that the way the topic is taught by the teacher will influence the student's perception and language
of that topic. Using the CIM, teachers can understand the chat transcript (how students interpret and manipulate
mathematical representations) and reflect on his/her teaching via sharing with fellow colleagues to devise an
alternative approach to teach the topic. Taking for example, stage 1 shows that there is a possible confusion in
using binomial formulas taught in secondary school and that taught in the JC. Teachers can bring across this
concept to the students as differentiating between positive n and negative n power in class. Teacher may also
surface this distinction of what is taught in secondary school and what is taught in JC as different to avoid
conceptual confusion in preparation of future lessons.

Moment to moment Interaction
        The quasi-synchronous chat environment logs the moment to moment interaction during the session.
Students communicated by typing their messages in the textual representations in the chat line, construct or
manipulate   artifacts   on  the shared    whiteboard   basing on  interpretations   of  representations    and   artifacts
constructed earlier. One possible limitation of the chat environment, unlike face to face communication (e.g.
classroom discussion) is that students will not be able to visually and audibly capture information (e.g. emotion,
intonation of voice) during the interaction (Garcia & Jacob, 1998). However the chat environment affords them
to visually   capture    the  communicated    message     representation,   giving   the    opportunity  to review     any
representation before appropriating a response, an avenue not possible in FTF communication as information
maybe lost due to selective listening.

Conclusion
        Our initial explorations of the use of GCC designed activities show us that it can help student to be
conscious  of    mathematical   situations through  the  identification of  errors, and  it can reinforce   their existing
conceptual understanding of mathematics learned during normal class time. It can improve their mathematical
reasoning  process    as they   attempt to justify their choices  of the   errors and  promote   dual   feedback   for  the

                                                                                                                               2-
         educator analyzing the chat transcript. By providing an alternative approach to the learning of mathematics, the
         GCC    activity  implemented  in   chat environment    provides  a context   for  students  to engage  in meaningful
         discourse. Teachers should tailor the GCC problem to suit the needs of the class rather than adopting a "one size
         fits all" concept.  They  should  explore the use   of alternative assessment    for the learning process  in the chat
         environment    rather  than assessing   students on producing    a complete   solution   or answer  to a  mathematics
         problem.   Subsequent    research will  explore  running more    GCC    sessions  on various   mathematical   topics to
         measure its effectiveness in providing students the opportunity to identify conceptual errors and co-construct
         proposed solutions in a collaborative setting.
