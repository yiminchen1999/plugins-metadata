         Abstract: To facilitate medical students' diagnostic knowledge a case-based worked example
         approach was realized in a complex computer-based learning environment. To enhance the
         effectiveness of the approach the measures erroneous examples and elaborated feedback were
         additionally implemented. 153 medical students were randomly assigned to four experimental
         conditions of a 2x2-factorial design (errors vs. no errors, elaborated feedback vs. knowledge
         of correct result (KOR)). In order to assess the sustainability of the learning environment a
         subgroup of subjects (n = 52) was compared with a comparable group of students who did not
         participate in the experiment (n = 145) with respect to their performance in a regular multiple
         choice test. Results show that the acquisition of diagnostic knowledge is mainly fostered by
         providing erroneous examples in combination with elaborated feedback. These effects were
         independent from differences in time-on-task and prior knowledge. Furthermore, the effects of
         the learning environment proved sustainable.

Introduction
         Diagnosing    is  a   fundamental  competence    for  every  physician.     However,  students   and   attending
physicians have enormous difficulties ascertaining the right diagnosis. Gr‰sel and Mandl (1993) for example
showed that medical students proceed in an additive and mechanic way even at the end of their clinical studies;
they tend to collect high amounts of data without building concrete hypotheses. We postulate that diagnostic
knowledge consists of declarative knowledge components (conceptual knowledge; "what-information"), action-
related  knowledge   components     like  strategic knowledge      ("how-information")     and teleological  knowledge
("why-information"; van Gog, Paas, & van Merri nboer, 2004). The students in the study of Gr‰sel and Mandl
(1993) primarily showed deficits in the latter two knowledge components. Furthermore, the three components
are not  sufficiently  integrated   into  more   abstract  structures  (schemata)    allowing   effective and   efficient
diagnostic reasoning.
         In order   to overcome     this problem    and to   foster diagnostic knowledge       which  allows  competent
diagnostic reasoning, a complex computer-based learning environment was developed. This environment based
on the CASUS platform which already proved effective in various studies on case-based learning in different
fields of medicine (Fischer, 2000; Simonsohn, & Fischer, 2004).
         Following Mandin (2001) diagnostic reasoning can be understood as schema-based problem-solving.
Therefore,  in order   to enhance   diagnostic knowledge,    effective   learning environments      have to  be provided
which systematically support the students constructing and organizing schemata. Learning environments taking
advantage of the worked example effect (Gerjets, Scheiter, & Catrambone, 2004; Renkl, 2005) are especially
appropriate to achieve this challenging instructional goal. Worked examples are superior to directly teaching
abstract principles  as   well  as to actively solving    training  problems ≠    at least with  regard   to initial skill
acquisition (Gerjets   et al., 2004). This  worked  example    effect is attributed  to the fact that  studying  worked
examples   imposes   lower   levels of   cognitive load on   the learner  than solving     training problems  especially
because  no extensive     search processes  with regard   to the correct solution    steps are involved  (Gerjets et  al.,
2004). Therefore, more cognitive resources are free for demanding processes of schema construction. Moreover,
studying worked examples (in contrast to attempting to solve training problems) focuses the learner's attention
on information that is relevant to schema construction. In various domains, schema-based problem solving is
considered to be very effective and efficient. It proved to be a central characteristic of experts' problem solving
(Gerjets et al., 2004, p. 34).
         However, studies on the "self-explanation effect" (Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, & Glaser, 1989; Chi,
DeLeeuw, Chiu, & LaVancher, 1994; Renkl, 1997; Stark, 1999) clearly show that studying worked examples
does not automatically result in effective problem-solving schemas. In order to achieve this goal, processes of
cognitive and meta-cognitive self-explanation have to be fostered systematically by implementing additional
instructional measures (Atkinson, Renkl, & Merrill, 2003; Groﬂe, & Renkl, 2006; Stark, 1999). In addition, the
worked example method has to be adapted to the instructional context, the instructional goals and the domain in
which it is implemented.
         So far, worked examples were investigated primarily in studies on initial learning in rather simple and
well-structured domains.     Therefore   we combined    the  example  method   with   elements  of  case-based  learning
which proved effective in various problem-based learning scenarios in medicine (Hmelo, Duncan, & Chinn,

                                                                                                                             2-
         2007; Schmidt, Loyens, van Gog, & Paas, 2007). In addition, two instructional measures aiming at fostering
         diagnostic   knowledge    by stimulating     processes of  schema   induction   were    integrated into   the  learning
         environment: erroneous examples and elaborated feedback.
                  A major objective of our study was to assess the effectiveness of these instructional measures in the
         context of our case-based worked example approach. In addition, the influence of the two measures on time-on-
         task, cognitive load, and the sustainability of the learning environment in general were investigated.

       Learning from errors
                  Learning from errors is a promising method particularly in the field of medicine where errors in the
         process of diagnosing can have fatal consequences (Al-Assaf, Bumpus, Carter, & Dixon, 2003). Following the
         classification of diagnostic errors by Graber, Gordon, & Franklin (2002), we focused on relevant and severe
         cognitive  errors caused  by inadequate   knowledge    or  faulty data  gathering, inaccurate   clinical reasoning,  or
         faulty verification (Graber et al., 2002, p. 983). According to Oser and Spychiger (2005), every error includes
         the chance to learn from it when learners use them purposeful as learning occasion. Therefore, they have to
         identify the error and understand the correct solution by comparing the incorrect solution systematically with the
         correct one. A study of Groﬂe and Renkl (2004) can be interpreted in terms of the necessity of implementing
         effective feedback methods when confronting learners with erroneous examples.

       Feedback
                  Following van Gog et al. (2004), understanding of a procedure must involve both knowledge of its
         domain and of its teleology. Knowledge of a domain consists of principled knowledge about objects and events
         in that domain. Knowledge of the teleology of a procedure is knowledge of the rationale behind or purpose of
         the steps  in a   procedure  (van  Gog    et al., 2004). Therefore,   effective   feedback should   not  only  contain
         information concerning conceptual knowledge, but also information which informs the learner of the rationale
         behind the selection and application of operators (so called "why information") and information about strategic
         knowledge used by experts selecting the operators (so called "how information"). These knowledge components
         also represent our model of diagnostic knowledge (see above).
                  Especially    when  learners are confronted   with   complex  tasks,  elaborated  feedback   which   combines
         these kinds of information (in comparison to less informative feedback like knowledge of correct result (KOR)
         feedback)  has  positive  effects  on  feedback    reception  (Jacoby,  Troutman,   Mazursky,   &   Kuss,    1984)  and
         knowledge acquisition (e. g. Collins, Carnine, & Gersten, 1987; Krause, 2007; Narciss, 2001; Pridemore, &
         Klein, 1991). However, when only conceptual knowledge has to be acquired, KOR-feedback can be sufficient
         (e. g. Kulhavy, White, Topp, Chan, & Adams, 1985).

       Time-on-task
                  The implementation of erroneous examples and feedback in the present study aimed at enhancing the
         effectiveness of the learning environment by fostering the quality of learning processes. However, coping with
         erroneous examples and processing elaborated feedback information (or compensating marginal feedback by
         self-explanation) and   the resulting processes   can  result in prolongation   of time-on-task,   that is, quality and
         quantity  of learning  processes  can be  confounded.    From  a  practical perspective,  such effects   are acceptable
         when the prolongations are moderate and at the same time associated with substantial learning effects. However,
         from a theoretical perspective, they are only acceptable when they do not undermine internal validity of the
         study. In spite of these   potential  problems,   time-on-task was  not restricted  because  of considerations   about
         ecological   validity: following an   integrative research   approach   (Stark  &  Mandl,  2007),  it was    planned to
         investigate the effects of the two instructional measures under conditions which are not too far from realistic
         learning scenarios in practice.

       Cognitive Load
                  From the perspective of cognitive load theory (CLT, Sweller, 1988), learning with errors makes greater
         demands on working memory than processing correct information, especially when only KOR-feedback is given
         and the learners have to explain themselves why the provided information is incorrect and draw consequences
         for further diagnostic steps. In a complex learning environment, these processes can lead to cognitive overload
         (Renkl,  Gruber,  Weber,   Lerche,  &  Schweizer,   2003)  and   interfere with further knowledge     acquisition.  This
         problem   can be  compensated     by  providing   elaborated  feedback, at  least  when  the design   of the  feedback
         procedure is in line with CLT (Sweller, van MerriÎnboer, & Paas, 1998).

       Research questions
                  1. To what extent time-on-task is increased by erroneous examples and elaborated feedback?

2-0
We expected that both measures increase time-on-task. However, it was postulated that the potential effects on
diagnostic knowledge cannot be explained by differences in time-on-task.
         2. To what extent diagnostic knowledge is facilitated by erroneous examples and elaborated feedback?
It was assumed that both erroneous examples and elaborated feedback have positive effects on the acquisition of
diagnostic knowledge and that the combination of both measures is especially effective.
         3. Which influence do both instructional measures exert on cognitive load?
It was  expected    that  cognitive  load is  increased  through   providing   erroneous    examples, especially in  the
combination     with  KOR-feedback.    In   addition, we  supposed    that cognitive load   and  diagnostic  knowledge
correlate negatively.
         4. To what extent effects of the learning environment are sustainable?
It was supposed that effects of the learning environment on conceptual knowledge can still be verified six weeks
after the learning session.

Method
Sample and design
         A total of 153 medical students (104 females and 49 males) from the universities of Munich, Germany
took part in the study. All participants studied in the clinical part of the curriculum, ranging from the second to
the sixth clinical   semester.   The  average age  was   around   25  years (M  =  25.02,   SD =  3.62). Students   were
voluntarily  recruited   and received  40   Euros for  participation. The   subjects were   randomly  assigned   to four
conditions of a 2x2-factorial design (see table1).

Table 1: 2◊2-factorial design.

                         Design                                       faktor 2: feedbackElaboratedKOR
            factor 1: errors      with errorswithout errors n = 36n = 40                     n = 41n = 36

         Sustainability was assessed by comparing 145 students in the second clinical semester who did not
participate  in our   study  (control group)  with   the 52 subjects  from  the  same semester   (experimental   group)
concerning the results of a regular multiple choice test. The 52 students were selected from all experimental
conditions; they were comparable with the rest of the participants concerning learning prerequisites and learning
outcomes (that is diagnostic knowledge) at the end of the learning session. In addition, experimental and control
group subjects did not differ with respect to relevant learning prerequisites.

Learning environment
         The    learning  environment,    integrated  in  the   CASUS   learning   platform,   consisted  of a schema
illustrating the   steps of  the diagnostic  process  and   six worked  examples    dealing  with  pheochromozytoma,
primary   hyperaldosteronism,     and  renal  artery  stenosis. Working    through   these  examples,  the learners  see
themselves in the role of a (fictitious) student doing an elective working together with a general practitioner
giving feedback. All examples begin with a clinical situation. In the learning environment, the protagonist starts
drawing his conclusions for the diagnosis and for the further procedure. Subsequently, the general practitioner
gives feedback     on his diagnostic  steps.  Then   the sequence  of giving   information,   drawing  conclusions  and
getting feedback goes on until at the end the final diagnosis is reached. Every example consists of three to four
of such sequences containing three to four screenshots.
         The additionally given schema allows to contextualize the steps of the diagnostic process by providing
the problem space containing all hypertension illnesses. Additionally the schema explains the relation between
the different illnesses and the underlying pathophysiological processes. Furthermore, it is shown which further
information is needed for excluding and including a diagnosis, respectively.

Instructional measures
         Errors. In the condition without errors, the protagonist is presented coming to the right considerations
on  the basis   of the   given information,   drawing  the  right conclusions   and  finishing the  case with  the  right
diagnosis. In the condition with errors, the protagonist makes severe errors, which the students had to study. The
choice of the errors was guided by the above-mentioned error taxonomy from Graber et al. (2002); in addition, it
was inspired by an analysis of relevant cognitive errors in this domain. After every wrong decision, the error is
corrected in form of the general practitioner's feedback.
         Feedback.     In the    elaborated version   of the  feedback,    the (fictitious) physician  gives additional
explanations to the (right or wrong) considerations and further consequences drawn by the student. Furthermore,

                                                                                                                            2-
         he elucidates the diagnostic process referring to underlying pathophysiological knowledge. The conditions with
         KOR-feedback     were  very  frugal  in   comparison    to the  elaborated   version.  Considerations,   conclusions,  and
         further procedures are only evaluated as right or wrong without further explanation. In the condition "errors and
         KOR-feedback" the learners had to deduce the right step in the diagnostic process from the subsequent solution
         step of the example.   All   feedback  information   was   presented    by  providing  written  texts, no  audio  or video
         components were implemented in this learning environment.

        Instruments and data collection
                  Prior  knowledge.    The    prior    knowledge    test measuring      domain   specific   conceptual   knowledge
         contained 21 multiple choice questions, most of which have been used in the German medical examination.
         Basing on analyses of reliability, two tasks were excluded from further analysis. So 19 points could be achieved
         in this measure. The reliability of the test was sufficient (Cronbach's Alpha = .63).
                  Diagnostic   knowledge.    The   construct  of  diagnostic    knowledge   comprised    conceptual,  strategic and
         teleological knowledge. The 19 conceptual knowledge tasks of the prior knowledge were presented again after
         the learning phase (Cronbach's Alpha = .60). In order to measure strategic knowledge, ten key feature problems
         (maximum:    29 points)  were  applied    (Bordage,  Brailovsky,    Carretier,  &  Page,    1995; Fischer, Kopp,   Holzer,
         Ruderich, & J¸nger, 2005). The reliability was .72 (Cronbach's Alpha). Additionally, problem solving questions
         were  presented   which  functioned   as    a measure   for   strategic and  teleological   knowledge.    Students  had to
         generate their first leading diagnosis upon the information of a given clinical case scenario. Furthermore, they
         were asked to explain their decision and to describe the underlying pathophysiological processes (Cronbach's
         Alpha = .73; Maximum: 20 points). The three tests measuring diagnostic knowledge correlated with Pearson
         coefficients between .45 and .63. The reliability of the aggregated diagnostic knowledge measure (Maximum:
         68 points) was .85 (Cronbach's Alpha).
                  Cognitive load was assessed by a rating scale of Paas und Kalyuga (2005) with nine items in which the
         learners had to evaluate the difficulty of the task and their mental effort on seven steps (from 1 "very low" to 7
         "very high").  The  rating   scale was  presented   during    the  learning  session  after the third  and sixth  example.
         Cronbach's Alpha was .75 and .83, respectively.
                  Sustainability  of  the   learning environment    was    assessed  by  a  regular  multiple  choice exam    which
         consisted of thirty questions    measuring    primarily  conceptual    knowledge   in  the  domain   of  internal medicine
         (Cronbach`s Alpha = .68; Maximum: 30 points). Seven of these questions dealt with the content matter of the
         learning  environment    (arterial hypertension);   the  rest of   the tasks had   to do  with  other  aspects  of internal
         medicine.

        Time-on-task
                  Time-on-task was recorded automatically by the computer-based learning environment.

        Procedure
                  After  a  short introduction   students  completed     the multiple   choice  test  measuring   prior  knowledge
         followed by the learning session in which the students worked with the learning environment and gave their
         ratings on  the cognitive    load  scale. After   a pause   of  15  minutes,   the students   worked    on the  diagnostic
         knowledge tests. Six weeks after the experiment, the regular multiple choice exam took place.

       Results
        Time-on-task
                  Students learning with elaborated feedback worked significantly longer with the learning environment
         than  students  in the two   KOR-conditions      (see   table  2). The   main   effect "feedback"     was  significant and
         substantial (F(1,149) = 36.15; p < .01; ≤ = .20). Errors had only a small effect on time-on-task which did not
         reach statistical significance (F(1,149 < 1). The interaction missed statistical significance as well (F(1, 149) <
         1). Time-on-task   was   not associated   with   diagnostic   knowledge.    In the four  groups,   the correlations  varied
         between .01 and .09.

        Effects on diagnostic knowledge
                  Concerning    prior knowledge,       no significant  group    differences   were   found. However,     descriptive
         differences in prior knowledge and time-on-task were statistically controlled in the subsequent analyses.
                  There were neither ceiling nor floor effects. With respect to conceptual knowledge, students in the
         condition  "with   errors-elaborated  feedback"     achieved   the  highest  scores.  Students  working    with   erroneous
         examples combined with KOR-feedback did rather poorly. The scores of the other two groups differed only
         marginally  and   lay in-between    the   scores of  the   two  "extreme    groups".   Concerning    the other  aspects of
         diagnostic knowledge, the same descriptive pattern appeared (see table 2).

         Concerning   conceptual    knowledge  assessed   by multiple  choice  questions,  the main  effect "errors"
(F(1,145) = 3.88; p < .05; ≤ = .03) was significant. On average, more conceptual knowledge was acquired when
erroneous examples were provided. Neither the main effect "feedback" (F < 1) nor the interaction (F(1,145) =
2.10; n. s.) were significant.
         With respect to strategic knowledge measured by key feature problems, again the main effect ,,errors"
was significant (F(1,145) = 3.99; p < .05; ≤ = .03), qualified by a significant "errors x feedback"-interaction
(F(1,145) = 7.58; p < .01; ≤ = .05). The main effect "feedback" was not significant (F < 1). As expected,
students profited from erroneous examples especially when they received elaborated feedback.
         A  different picture  emerged   when  the  results in strategic and  teleological knowledge    assessed  by
problem solving questions were analyzed. Here the feedback-factor proved significant F(1,145) = 4.40; p < .05;
≤ = .03). The interaction was significant, too (F(1,145) = 5.96; p < .05; ≤ = .04). The main effect ,,errors" had
no influence (F < 1). Only when erroneous examples were provided, elaborated feedback was beneficial here.
         To  sum  up,  acquisition   of  conceptual   knowledge    was enhanced     by erroneous  examples.   When
erroneous  examples   were     combined  with elaborated    feedback,  they also  fostered acquisition   of strategic
knowledge. The third aspect of diagnostic knowledge was supported by elaborated feedback, especially when
erroneous examples were presented. These effects were independent from prior knowledge and differences in
time-on-task.

Cognitive load
         Table 2 shows that both times, learners in the condition ,,with errors-KOR" showed the highest load
scores; in the  condition ,,without   errors-KOR"   the lowest  load   scores occurred.  The   other two conditions
differed only marginally. At t1, the main effect "errors" was significant (F(1,149) = 5.05; p < .05; ≤ = .03). At
t2, the descriptive findings were comparable; however, the level of statistical significance was missed (F(1,148)
= 3.56; p < .10). The main effect "feedback" was not significant (t1 and t2: F(1,149) < 1). However, both times,
the interaction between errors and feedback was significant (t1: F(1,149) = 5.18; p < .05; ≤ = .03; t2: F(1,148) =
4.53; p <  .05; ≤   = .03). As   expected,  providing   erroneous  examples   in combination   with  KOR-feedback
enhanced cognitive load.
         Under  all   learning  conditions, cognitive   load   and diagnostic    knowledge   correlated  negatively.
However, the relation was not very strong, ranging from -.11 to -.49.

Sustainability
         In the multiple choice questions not dealing with arterial hypertension, students participating in the
experiment reached 15.7 of 23 points (SD = 3.12), the control group 14.8 points (SD = 3.11). This difference
was not significant (F(1,195) = 2.99; n.s.). However, in the arterial hypertension questions, the experimental
group reached 5.59 of 7 points (SD = 0.95), whereas the control group reached only 5.07 points (SD = 1.14).
This effect was significant (F(1,195) = 8.49; p < .01) but not substantial (≤ = .04).

Discussion
         Our  results show     that the acquisition  of diagnostic  knowledge    is mainly  fostered  by    providing
erroneous examples in combination with elaborated feedback. When only KOR-feedback is given, erroneous
examples are detrimental. These results were independent from prior knowledge and time-on-task. Against the
background of the rather short time-on-task invested by learners in all conditions, even the rather small effects

                                                                                                                        2-
         of the two instructional measures are remarkable. They confirm pedagogical considerations about the learning
         potential of errors (Oser & Spychiger, 2005). The unfavourable effect of erroneous examples in combination
         with KOR-feedback on knowledge acquisition replicates findings of studies in which erroneous examples were
         provided   without  informative   feedback measures   (Groﬂe   &   Renkl,   2004). In addition, they  are in  line with
         current feedback    research in  which the  effectiveness   of informative  feedback   measures  is  stressed  (Krause,
         2007), at least in complex learning. For most students, the information that a specific diagnostic conclusion or
         procedure is not adequate seems not to be sufficient to induce deep conceptual understanding. The information
         deficit in the  conditions   with KOR-feedback,     especially  when    the learners  are confronted   with  erroneous
         examples, has to be compensated by effective self-explanation (Chi et al., 1989; Renkl, 2005; Stark, 1999).
         However,   as   Renkl (1997)  showed,  a   lot of  learners process example   information    rather superficially. As a
         result, the full potential of the learning method is not tapped. In fact, at least in the context of complex learning
         environments, the given feedback has to inform the students why the respective step in the problem solving
         process is wrong and which specific conclusion or procedure is adequate.
                  The unfavourable effects of erroneous examples in combination with KOR-feedback also correspond
         with CLT (Sweller, 1988): this learning condition was associated with the highest load scores. As these scores in
         our study were negatively related with knowledge acquisition, the conclusion is suggestive that this learning
         condition reduced the worked example effect by imposing too much extraneous load on the learners (Sweller et
         al., 1998). It has to be noted that our study does not allow for insights concerning the effects of diagnostic errors
         made by the learners themselves but only for insights of erroneous example information studied by the learners.
         According    to Oser  and  Spychiger   (2005),    errors made   by  the learners   themselves   might  be comparably
         productive, at least when immediate and elaborated feedback is secured and a learning context is given in which
         a positive   "Fehlerkultur"  is  realized. However,      analyzing the  effects of  learner  errors  makes   necessary
         completely different study designs.
                  Six weeks after the experiment was over, effects of the learning environment on conceptual knowledge
         were still significant. The fact that this effect only occurred when the learners had to answer multiple choice
         questions focussing on content aspects represented in the learning environment can be interpreted as a kind of
         validation of the sustainability effect. From a pedagogical perspective, this finding is astonishing because the
         learning sessions were short and the learning environment is not specialised on fostering conceptual knowledge
         but on diagnostic knowledge which also includes strategic and teleological knowledge components. In further
         studies, sustainability analyses should include all aspects of diagnostic knowledge. In addition, in order to gain
         more distinguished insights into the sustainability of the instructional measures, further analyses should include
         larger experimental groups which enable differentiated comparisons.
                  If the positive findings of our study can be replicated, the learning environment should be integrated
         into the regular clinical curriculum at university. Concerning further studies, thinking aloud procedures (e. g.
         Ericsson,  &  Simon,   1993)  should   be  employed   in  order to  investigate effects   of erroneous  examples    and
         feedback on the quality of the learning process. Only by recording the learners' self-explanations, more direct
         indicators for pedagogically desired processes of schema induction can be won.
