                   Abstract: In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to virtual learning. Individual
                   characteristics are known to play a crucial role in learning processes but only limited research
                   has been conducted in the context of virtual settings. Therefore, we used an integrated multi-
                   method approach in order to examine the impact of types of academic motivation (intrinsic vs.
                   extrinsic) on virtual learning.  This study of 100 online summer course participants indicates
                   that the willingness to contribute to discourse depends on the type of motivation. Intrinsically
                   motivated  learners   became    central and   prominent     contributors  to cognitive   discourse. In
                   contrast, extrinsically motivated   learners  contributed   less  and  were  positioned  on  the outer
                   fringe of the social network.

       Introduction
                   The attention for virtual learning is fuelled by two separate yet mutually enforcing developments: The
         increasing possibilities of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) to support collaboration (Bromme,
         Hesse, &   Spada,   2005; Schellens    &   Valcke,  2005)   and  the  evidence   that  collaboration can   enrich  student
         learning through interaction (Lindblom-Ylänne, Pihlajamäki, & Kotkas, 2003). Despite the positive possibilities
         or affordances  of   ICT-tools    (Kirschner, Strijbos,  Kreijns,     &   Beers, 2004),  recent  findings  in Computer-
         supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) indicate that learners who seem similar with respect to educational
         background and prior knowledge nevertheless contribute differently to discourse (De Laat, Lally, Lipponen, &
         Simons,   2007; Schellens    &    Valcke,  2005).   In  particular,   Schellens   &   Valcke  (2005)   found  significant
         differences amongst individuals with respect to both amount and type of discourse. Although recent research
         findings indicate that individual learners differ with respect to the amount and type of discourse contributed,
         little is known about what the causes of these differences in discourse are. This study questions the influence of
         motivation on the discourse in virtual settings. The nature of distance learning and the limited role of the teacher
         in collaborative learning constellation (Kirschner, Strijbos, Kreijns, & Beers, 2004) suggest a dominant role for
         intrinsic motivation,  relative  to extrinsic motivation.    Hence,   we   will  analyse  to what  extent  differences  in
         individual contributions to discourse are explained by differences in motivation. As recommended by recent
         research (De Laat, Lally, Lipponen, & Simons, 2007; De Wever, Schellens, Valcke, & Van Keer, 2006), we will
         use a multi-method approach of Content Analysis, which measures the type of discourse activity, as well as
         Social Network Analysis approach, which measures the interaction processes among learners. Afterwards, we
         will link the contributions   to  discourse and   the   position in   the social network  of  each individual   learner to
         his/her type of motivation.

       Individual contributions to discourse
                   According to two recent reviews of CSCL-literature (De Wever, Schellens, Valcke, & Van Keer, 2006;
         Rourke, Anderson, Garrison, & Archer, 2001), most researchers use content analysis (CA) schemes to describe
         discourse  in CSCL.   According     to De   Wever    et al. (2006),   content   analysis techniques  are   used to reveal
         evidence about learning and knowledge construction from online discussions. In other words, content analysis
         reveals what participants are talking about. While a large number of researchers in CSCL use content analysis,
         recently a number of critiques have been raised. First of all, there are several methodological concerns about
         CA, which are primarily concerns about inter-rated reliability, replicability (De Wever, Schellens, Valcke, &
         Van  Keer,  2006;   Schellens &   Valcke,   2005)  and  subjectivity    (Rourke  &   Anderson,   2004; Strijbos  & Stahl,
         2007). Secondly,    and more  fundamentally,      CA  methods    fail to  depict the interaction and  learning  processes
         among  individual   learners  (De   Laat,  Lally, Lipponen,   &   Simons,   2007;   Jeong,   2003; Rourke  &    Anderson,
         2004). Interaction   among    learners  is known    to  be  an   essential  trigger  for motivation,  feedback    and co-
         construction of knowledge (Hmelo-Silver, 2004; Jonassen & Kwon, 2001; Schellens & Valcke, 2005). Focusing
         on content analysis alone, without taking into consideration interaction processes, restricts our understanding of
         learning processes in virtual settings (De Laat, Lally, Lipponen, & Simons, 2007; Jeong, 2003). To avoid this,
         we combined the method of content analysis with insights from social network analysis (SNA).
                   SNA, a method taken from disciplines like sociology and graph theory (Freeman, 2000; Wassermann
         &  Faust,  1994),   provides  us  with  several   tools to  analyse   interaction  patterns  among   individual  learners.
         According to Aviv et al. (2003), a social network is defined as a group of collaborating (and/or competing)

2-2
entities that are related to each other. Social Network Analysis can be considered as a wide-ranging strategy to
explore social structures to uncover the existence of social positions of individuals within the network (Aviv,
Erlich, Ravid, & Geva, 2003). According to Russo and Koesten (2005), SNA can provide a better understanding
of patterns of interaction of individuals in virtual settings. De Laat et al. (2007) have argued that individuals
who are central in the network are in a better position to contribute to discourse than those who are on the outer
ring of the network. According to Russo & Koesten (2005), centrality gives a learner the ability to reach others
in the network. A learner with a large degree of centrality is in direct contact with many other learners in the
social network and therefore might benefit from insights of others. In addition, the more central a learner is in a
network, the more power an learner has to influence the direction in which the team is moving (Freeman, 2000).
In contrast, other researchers (e.g. Burt, Jannotta, & Mahoney, 1998) see cohesive ties as a source of rigidity
that hinders the coordination of complex tasks. In other words, the most favourable position of a learner in a
social network is still a matter of debate.

Role of individual motivation
          Individual student characteristics are known to play a crucial role in learning processes in face-to-face
settings  (Vermetten,    Lodewijks,  &  Vermunt,    2001).   According    to Ryan    &  Deci  (2000),   most   theories of
motivation regard it as a unitary phenomenon, implying that a learner has either a lot or little motivation, also
referred  to as  motivation   versus amotivation.   To  be   motivated  means    to  be moved    to do  something,  while
amotivation is a state of lacking any intention to act (Ryan & Deci, 2000). However, focusing only on the level
of motivation ignores the underlying attitudes and goals the learner has in order to pursue an action or goal. In
particular,  the type   of motivation  (intrinsic/extrinsic) has an important     influence on   a  learner's attitude and
learning behaviour (Vallerand et al., 1992). Following the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) of Ryan & Deci
(2000), in intrinsically motivated learning the drive to learn is derived from the satisfaction and pleasure of the
activity of learning itself; no external rewards come in play. Externally motivated learning refers to learning that
is a means to an end, and not engaged for its own sake. According to Ryan & Deci (2000, p. 56), intrinsic
motivation is "... a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical development because it is through acting
on  one's   inherent  interests that one   grows   in knowledge    and   skills".  In a  subtheory   of   SDT,   Cognitive
Evaluation   Theory     (CET),  social and  environmental      factors play  an   important  role   in determining   what
facilitates and what hinders intrinsic motivation. A learner's motivation is influenced by the social environment
in  class (Legault,     Green-Demers,   &  Pelletier, 2006).   More    specific,  in  SDT   feelings   of competence    in
combination with a sense of autonomy are important facilitators for intrinsic motivation to occur, to maintain
and to   enhance.    Positive feedback  on  competence    have   been   found   to  have a  positive   effect on  intrinsic
motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000). The learner's social network (teacher, family, friends) supports his or her
feelings of competence (Legault, Green-Demers, & Pelletier, 2006). In fact, when the social network supports
and enhances     the learner's  autonomy   and  competence,    the learner  will  become  more     intrinsically motivated
(Reeve, Bolt, & Cai, 1999). Also opportunities for self-direction (i.e. more autonomy for the learner) enhance
intrinsic motivation, while threats, deadlines and imposed goals diminish intrinsic motivation (Ryan & Deci,
2000).
          The research presented here looks into the effects of type of academic motivation of learners on their
contribution  to  virtual  learning. Several  researchers    (Bromme,   Hesse,    &  Spada,  2005;   Kirschner,   Strijbos,
Kreijns,  &  Beers,  2004)    have argued  that following    a course  in an  online  setting is   more   demanding    than
following a course in a face-2-face setting. According to Williams et al. (2006), studying online can be a lonely
and frustrating experience, in particular when the social interaction is limited. Bromme, Hesse and Spada argue
that also barriers of meaning might hinder effective communication among learners. For example, the intention
of one learner posting a message in a discussion-board or chat-box might be interpreted differently by another
learner due to a lack of context, body-language or writing-style (Bromme, Hesse, & Spada, 2005). Also the role
of the teacher is more complex, whereby providing accurate and timely feedback is notoriously difficult due to
barriers in space and time    (Bromme, Hesse, & Spada, 2005; De Wever, Schellens, Valcke, & Van Keer, 2006).
Hence, the nature of distance learning and the limited role of the teacher in collaborative learning constellation
suggest a dominant role for intrinsic motivation, relative to extrinsic motivation. Learners who are intrinsically
motivated to learn will depend less on teacher interventions (Reeve, Bolt, & Cai, 1999; Ryan & Deci, 2000). In
contrast, students    who   are triggered   extrinsically  might   find  the  (delayed)   limited   support,   facilitation,
monitoring and tutoring of teachers in virtual settings troublesome. As a consequence, extrinsically motivated
students will contribute less to discourse when a teacher is more on the background of the learning process. In
the present study we analysed the learning that arose through the contributions of the individual learners from
two perspectives: content analysis and social network analysis. Based on the results of the content analysis, the
social networks      of various  content   categories  were    analysed  in  order   to distinguish    who  were   mainly
contributing to social and cognitive discourse. We used an integrated multi-method approach whereby we linked
the contribution   of   individual learner to  the type of   discourse  with  his/her   position in  the  social  network.
Afterwards, we combined these measures with motivation in order to assess the impact on learning process.

                                                                                                                               2-2
       Method
        Setting
                  The present   study  took place in  an  online summer    course for  prospective   bachelor students of  an
         International Business degree programme in the Netherlands. The aim of this course was to bridge the gap in
         economics prior knowledge for students starting a bachelor. The online course was given over a period of six
         weeks in which students were assumed to work for 10-15 hours per week.

        Subjects
                  In total 100 participants were randomly assigned in six teams. Data were analysed for those individuals
         who actually posted at least once a reaction in the discussion forum. A total of 82 participants were selected for
         analysis. The six teams had an average of 13.66 members (SD= 2.16, range = 11-17) per team. On average, 45%
         of the learners were female.

        Instruments
        Individual contribution to discourse using Content Analysis
                  Content analysis was conducted based on the instrument of Veerman & Veldhuis-Diermanse (2001)
         that has been used and validated by other researchers (e.g. Schellens & Valcke, 2005). Veerman and Veldhuis-
         Diermanse make a distinction between non-task related (1 planning; 2 technical; 3 social; 4 non-sense) and task-
         related discourse activity (5 facts; 6 experience/opinion; 7 theoretical ideas; 8 explication; 9 evaluation). Three
         independent coders were trained and coded independently all messages. As a unit of analysis, the complete
         message was chosen, unless the coders considered a message to consist of multiple elements. If two or more
         coders thought that a message consisted of multiple elements, the message was split. In addition, a message
         received a code when two or more coders used the same category. Students posted 2307 messages of which
         2075 were considered as "codeable" (90%). The Cronbach alpha () of these 2075 messages was 0.928. Most
         studies have set the minimum  at 0.7 and recommend setting  > 0.8 in order to assume inter-rater reliability.
         The Cohen's kappa between Coder 1 ­ 2, 2 ­ 3 and 1 ­ 3 were 0.71, 0.71 and 0.68 respectively. De Wever et al.
         (2006) argue that values between 0.4 and 0.75 represent fair to good agreement beyond chance.

        Position of individual within social network using Social Network Analysis
                  Two measures were employed in order to determine the position of individuals in social structures.
         First, Freeman's  degree   of Centrality (Freeman,  2000;   Wassermann      & Faust, 1994)   was  used  to  measure
         whether learners were central in the social network or not. If a learner contributes actively to discourse and most
         other learners respond to the activities of this learner, he/she will become a central learner in the network and
         therefore  have a high  degree  of  centrality. Besides  the  degree  of centralisation  of  each individual  of  all
         communication   (Reply  Degree),   we   used the results of  the  above  content analysis   and  integrated this into
         communication of only higher cognitive discourse (Reply HC Degree), which implies communication which is
         labelled as Theoretical Ideas, Explication and Evaluation. In other words, a high Reply HC Degree indicates that
         a learner actively contributed to higher cognitive discourse and is central in this network (see figure 1). Second,
         Ego network density of each individual within the network (Size) was used, which measures how many other
         learners a learner is directly connected to. As with the reply network, we also included a separate measure for
         higher cognitive discourse (HC Size).

        Individual motivation
                  Individual motivation   was    measured  by the    Academic    Motivation   Scale  (AMS),   developed    by
         Vallerand et al. (1992). The instrument consists of 28 items, to which students respond to the question stem
         "Why are you going to college?" There are seven subscales on the AMS, of which three belong to intrinsic
         motivation scale and three to extrinsic motivation scale. Intrinsic motivation subscales are intrinsic motivation to
         know (IMTK): learning for the satisfaction and pleasure to understand something new; intrinsic motivation to
         accomplish (IMTA): learning for experiencing satisfaction and pleasure to accomplish something; and intrinsic
         motivation to experience stimulation (IMES): learning to experience stimulating sensations. The three extrinsic
         motivation subscales are identified regulation (EMID), introjected regulation (EMIN), and external regulation
         (EMER). The three constitute a motivational continuum reflecting the degree of self-determined behaviour. The
         component most adjacent to intrinsic motivation is identified regulation: the student comes to value learning as
         important  and, therefore, performs  it out  of choice, but still for extrinsic reasons, as  for example    achieving
         personal goals. Regulation is introjected when the formerly external source of motivation has been internalised.
         Externally regulated learning occurs when learning is steered through external means, such as rewards. The last
         scale, amotivation (AMOT), constitutes the very extreme of the continuum: the absence of regulation, either
         externally directed or internally. Learners  who  were   high on  intrinsic motivation   in comparison  to  extrinsic

2-2
motivation are for simplicity purposes labelled in this paper as "intrinsically motivated learners". In contrast,
learners who were relatively high on extrinsic motivation are labelled as "extrinsically motivated learners". In
an extreme case, a learner can have both high levels of intrinsic as well as extrinsic motivation. The response-
rate on AMS-questionnaire was 93% and the Cronbach alpha for the seven items ranged from .760 to .856.

Analysis
          The present study used a methodology of an integrated multi-method approach to identify the effects of
differences in individual characteristics on type and amount of discourse. Data were gathered on the individual
level as well by means of the relative position of each learner within the social network using UCINET version
6.158. The interrelationships between all measures were assessed through correlation and MANOVA analyses
using SPSS 15.0.1.

          Table 1  presents the   descriptive statistics as well  as  the chi-squares in order to assess whether
individual learners differed from each other with respect to discourse activity as well as position within the
network. With respect to the number of posts per individual, there is a significant difference among participants
(2 (80) 2258.17, p < 0.00). On average, the learners contributed 25.64 messages and there are clear differences
amongst individuals with respect to the amount of discourse. In addition, if we distinguish between task- and
non-task related communication, again significant differences are found. If we look beyond mean values and
take into account standard deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis values, we found large variance in discourse
activities. Standard deviations are in all content analysis categories larger than its mean values. In addition, the
Skewness in all content analysis categories are positive and around two or higher, implying a distribution with a
right tail. Also the Kurtosis values indicate that observations are clustered more and have longer positive tails
than a normal distribution. Despite the longer positive tails, the standard errors in Skewness (.267) and Kurtosis
(.529) are smaller than two, which implies that we can still assume normality conditions. If we look into the
different categories that are discerned  by   Veerman     and  Veldhuis-Diermanse  (2001),  we  find evidence  of
differences in individual contributions to knowledge construction with the exception of category 9 (evaluation).
The distribution of the degree of centrality of our social network indicators follows a similar pattern as those of
content analysis, although the tail is slightly shorter. With respect to the number of connections (Size) each
individual learner has, the  differences are   still significant yet less pronounced  in comparison  to  the other

                                                                                                                       2-2
         parameters. In  sum,  we  find large differences  among  individuals with respect   to   the amount   and    type of
         discourse as well as some differences among individuals with respect to their position in the social network.
                  To illustrate the power of SNA in understanding the interaction of contributions of individuals, the
         social network of all discourse activity (left) as well as only higher cognitive discourse (right) of one virtual
         team is presented in Figure 1(1). Four aspects can be distinguished from these figures. First of all, the figures
         illustrate who is communicating with whom and what the direction of communication is. For example, in the left
         figure Tutor 4 has replied to a comment of Irine, which is indicated by the direction of the arrow. In addition,
         John and Catherina have a so-called reciprocal link when looking at all discourse activities, as they react both to
         each other's contribution and the arrow goes in both directions, while they do not have any direct link when
         looking at higher cognitive discourse. Second, some individuals within the network are more central than others.
         For example, Andre, Mark, Rick, Brigit and Judith are central members in the overall network, while Rick,
         Maria & Tiffany are central in the higher cognitive network. Third, some learners are on the outer fringe of the
         network and are not well-connected. For example, Don, Sandra and Irine are connected with less than four ties
         in the overall network, while they are not taking part in higher cognitive discourse. Finally, there are some
         learners who are connected with most learners but who are still on the outer fringe. For example, Joe, John,
         Jonathan and Brenda have more than 15 contributions but are still on the outer fringe of the overall network.
         This means that despite the fact that their ego-density (i.e. number of links to others) is large, they do not occupy
         a central position in the network. In the other five teams similar patterns are found. In sum, individuals differ
         with respect to the number of ties as well as with respect to the position in the network, which has also been
         found in other research (De Laat, Lally, Lipponen, & Simons, 2007; Russo & Koesten, 2005). An innovative
         feature is that by combining   the results of CA,   a more  pronounced picture    arises when   looking     at higher
         cognitive discourse.

        Relating students' motivations and contributions
                  Table 2 contains correlations between our selected learning indicators of content analysis and social
         network  analysis  with the motivations    scales from  the   AMS instrument (Vallerand      et al., 1992).    When
         comparing correlations over the content analysis categories, intrinsically motivated students focus more on task
         related than on non-task related issues. However, a one-way MANOVA results in an insignificant effect (Lamba
         (2, 72) = 1.560, p>0.10). Although the coefficient of non-task related discourse is positive, it is not significant at
         5% confidence interval. Within the non-task related issues, there is an above-average interest in organisational
         matters, like planning and technical issues. In other words, intrinsically motivated students contribute more to
         planning and technical issues. Within the task related issues, intrinsically motivated learners contribute more
         own experiences, theoretical ideas as well as explications. Adding own experiences to a particular problem will
         help learners to understand the problem as it is perceived and experienced by other individual learners. By
         sharing new theoretical ideas and comparing these findings with previously mentioned experiences, the mental
         model of the learner is extended. Finally, the elaboration of these ideas, which in the Veerman et al. (2000)
         model is labelled explication, will lead to a co-construction of knowledge of the learners in this virtual setting. A
         MANOVA confirms the results and a significant effect (Lamba (2, 69) = 2.783, p<0.05). Follow-up univariate
         ANOVAs indicated that Theoretical ideas was not significantly affected by intrinsic motivation (F (2, 69) =
         3.096, p = .083), but Experience (F (2, 69) = 5.273, p = .025) and Explication (F (2, 69) = 3.859, p = .053) was.
         The fact that no relationship has been found with respect to evaluation can be contributed to the limited number
         of messages  which   have been  categorised   as  evaluation. While intrinsically motivated     learners contribute

2-2
actively to  the various types    of discourse, extrinsically             motivated     learners contribute  on   an average level.
Interestingly, the extrinsically motivated learner adds on average significantly less social contributions in our
virtual settings. In sum, students who are intrinsically motivated contribute more to cognitive discourse, in
particular  experience, theoretical  ideas and   explication.                We have    been unable    to determine   what  type of
motivation has a positive effect on social discourse, although we find a clear negative relationship when learners
are extrinsically motivated.

Relating students' motivation to their position in the social network
         All three aspects of intrinsic motivation are positively correlated with the learning indicators from our
social  network    analysis. This implies  that intrinsically             motivated     students distinguished    themselves much
stronger from other students. In other words, individuals who were central contributors to discourse (Reply
Degree)  seem    to be intrinsically motivated  students,              which    is also supported  by   a  MANOVA      analysis. In
particular, when taking into consideration the type of discourse, students who are central in contributions of
higher cognitive discourse are mainly students who are intrinsically motivated. In other words, students like
Andre, Mark and Brigit in our example are intrinsically motivated students. If we also take into consideration
the number of links an individual learner has, the coefficients for higher cognitive discourse (HC Size) increase
and become significant even at 1%. This implies that intrinsically motivated students not necessarily need to be
in the centre of the network but can also be on the outer fringe, as long as these learners have sufficient
connections to other learners. In other words, students like Joe, Brenda and Jonathan are intrinsically motivated
students but are not the most central individuals in their network. Students who are extrinsically motivated are
not in the centre of the playground in our virtual setting. The number of links of extrinsically motivated learners
is limited and they are most likely to position themselves on the outer fringe of the social network.

Discussion
         The results of the present study indicate that individuals contribute differently to cognitive and social
discourse in virtual settings, depending on their type of motivation. Some learners were active contributors to
discourse, while other learners participated but did not contribute actively to discourse. With respect to social
discourse contributions of individuals, we found that intrinsically motivated students did not contribute more
non-task   related  messages  per se.  However,                intrinsically motivated  students  distinguished   themselves  with
respect  to contributing to   planning and   technical               issues. In particular planning,   activities are important  as
previous research (e.g. Jehn & Shah, 1997) has shown that effective learning behaviour starts with appropriate
planning. In virtual settings, where students work and learn without having received a training before, providing
feedback on technical issues might also be considered to be a strong merit and might help other students to

                                                                                                                                      2-2
         overcome their barriers to contribute to discourse (Bromme, Hesse, & Spada, 2005). Extrinsically motivated
         students contributed less actively to non-task related issues. In particular, they contributed significantly less to
         social  discourse.  Social  discourse has  been   found  to  be  a  crucial factor   for socio-constructivist         learning
         (Schellens & Valcke, 2005; Williams, Duray, & Reddy, 2006). The contribution to cognitive discourse in our
         setting  was positively related  to  students with    intrinsic motivation.  Learners    high on intrinsic           motivation
         contributed  more   task-related discourse  than  other  types   of  learners. In particular,  intrinsically         motivated
         students contributed more own experience, new theoretical ideas and explication. By building upon experiences
         of other students, each learner can construct his/her own mental model of his/her own experience and compare
         to what extent the experience of other learners differ (Jehn & Shah, 1997; Schellens & Valcke, 2005). Although
         contributing own experiences to other learners are important to internalise experiences of members of the team,
         linking these experiences with new theoretical ideas are crucial in academic settings. These contributions are
         regarded as important elements for collaborative learning settings as they lead to co-construction of knowledge.
         In contrast, extrinsically motivated students performed "on average" on all task-related categories. Important to
         note is that other learners might benefit from the co-construction of knowledge of others, even if they are not
         actively  building  on  the discourse.  In  other words,    by   reading and   following   the  discourse  as         well as
         constructing one's own mental model literature even "passive" students might learn from discourse activity.
                   With respect to the position of the individual in the network, large differences were found amongst
         learners. Central learners in the virtual social network appear to be intrinsically motivated students. Another
         innovative element in our study is that we integrated the results of content analysis with social network analysis,
         which we expect to improve our insights of interaction processes as well as the type of interaction. When we
         take  only  higher  cognitive  discourse   activities into  consideration,   central contributors  were    intrinsically
         motivated learners. In addition, learners who had more connections in general were intrinsically motivated
         learners. Quite interestingly, when looking at higher cognitive communication, having more ties to others is an
         important merit. The coefficients were slightly larger than the coefficients of centrality, implying that having
         more ties might be more important than being in the centre. In other words, learners who were in between the
         centre and the outer fringe of the network might also play an important role in (higher) cognitive discourse.
         Finally, extrinsically motivated learners scored low on both centrality and ego-density measures, implying that
         these learners were not in the centre of the network and had only a limited number of ties. In other words,
         extrinsically motivated learners in our setting are learners who were on the outer fringe of the network.
                   Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques provided a powerful and useful bridging tool for two fields
         of research which are commonly separated, namely the focus of cognitive and social discourse of individuals
         versus team learning behaviour. While Jeong (2003) analyses group interaction from sequential analysis of
         messages,   our research    focuses  on interaction   among     individuals  rather  than  messages.    By           measuring
         interactivity of discourse activities, we found that individuals take different position in social networks. In
         particular, by integrating the results of the content analysis and the social network analysis, we were able to
         distinguish the type of interactivity. Finally, the correlations of the Academic Motivation Scale with the results
         of the content analysis and social network analysis indicate that the degree and type of activity in virtual
         learning depends on the type of motivation. Learners who were characterised as intrinsically motivated learners
         contributed more to (higher cognitive) discourse activity than extrinsically motivated learners and are central in
         the social network.

        Future Research and Practical implications
                   In future work, we will elaborate on our preliminary findings by incorporating individual as well as
         group effects. By using a multi-level analysis or clustering individuals in different levels of motivation, we will
         disentangle any interaction effects. Furthermore, controlled assignment of students to teams based on individual
         characteristics might create even more attractive learning conditions. In future research, we will also include
         research  on  learning  styles into our analysis  in   order to  understand    what  type  of  learning style         is most
         appropriate in our virtual settings. Afterwards, we intend to construct teams based on our findings, whereby a
         mix of students with various learning styles and motivation types are combined. These findings are relevant for
         teachers, managers,  admission    officers and   schedulers  as  the results   imply that  arranging teams           based on
         motivations might lead to superior cognitive performance of individuals as well as teams.
