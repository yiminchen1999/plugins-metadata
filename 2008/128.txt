                 Abstract:   This study   of the flow    of online   discussions examined     how previous     messages
                 affected the current message along five dimensions: (1) evaluations (agreement, disagreement,
                 or unresponsive actions); (2) knowledge content (contribution, repetition, or null content); (3)
                 social cues (positive, negative, or none); (4) personal information (number of visits); and (5)
                 elicitation (eliciting response     or not).  Using  dynamic    multilevel   analysis (DMA)      and a
                 structural equation model (SEM), this study analyzed 131 messages of 47 participants across
                 seven topics in the mathematics forum of a university Bulletin Board System (BBS) Website.
                 Results  showed   that a disagreement      or contribution in the    previous message  yielded    more
                 disagreements and social cue displays in the current message. Unlike face-to-face discussions,
                 online discussion messages that disagreed with a previous message elicited more responses.
                 Together, these results suggest that teachers can use and manage online discussions to promote
                 critical thinking, facilitate discussion of controversial topics, and reduce status effects.

       Introduction
                 Studies  on  FTF  discussions   have   shown   that the actions   of earlier speakers can   affect those of the
         current speaker. For example, a person is more likely to agree if the previous speaker agreed (Chiu & Khoo,
         2003). Hence, earlier messages might also affect later messages in online forums. By understanding how online
         discussions evolve message by message, educators can improve their quality and facilitate student learning.
                 Most    previous studies  on online    discussions  examined    the  individual  properties   of each  message
         (Tallent-Runnels et al., 2006; Hara, Bonk, & Angeli, 2000; Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2001; Schellens &
         Valcke, 2005). Their results showed that many students processed course information at high cognitive levels
         and used more critical thinking during online discussions (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000).
                 Using data on 131 messages by 47 respondents on seven topics, we extend this line of research in three
         ways.  First, we propose  a   framework     consisted of five dimensions     for examining    the relationships  among
         messages in an online independent academic forum. Second, we explicate a new methodology for analyzing
         these relationships, a modified version of Chiu and Khoo's (2005) dynamic multilevel analyses. Lastly, we apply
         this revised  method to  test how   earlier messages'  evaluations, knowledge      content,  social cues,  and personal
         information affected the properties of each message in a mathematics forum on a Univeristy Bulletin Board
         System (BBS) Website.

       Five dimensions characterizing online discussion messages
                 Building on past studies of FTF and online discussions (Chiu, 2000; Chiu & Khoo 2003; Henri, 1992;
         Garrison et al., 2000), we introduce a framework for characterizing messages in online academic discussion
         forums  along  five dimensions.  The  detailed   dimensions   and  their  possible   consequences   in FTF   and online
         discussion processes are shown in table 1. We define "e-poster" as a person who has posted a message on the
         online discussion board.

Evaluations
          Evaluations characterize how the current speaker or e-poster assesses the previous action. By linking
messages together, evaluations increase the coherence of interactions (Goodwin & Goodwin, 1987). Evaluations
can be agreements, disagreements, or unresponsive actions.
          As online   discussions tend to  be less   personalized compared    to  FTF  discussions,  online discussion
participants tend to be less concerned about one another's feelings (Brown & Levinson, 1987) and hence more
likely to express  their disagreements.    These disagreement   messages      often include  new  information  used to
support its opposition. This new content, in turn, is more likely to elicit a response (often disagreement). In
contrast, agreement messages that support the previous message need not add much content, thereby providing
less added information for others to reference. Hence, a disagreement message is more likely to elicit response
than an agreement message in online forums.

Knowledge content
          The knowledge content dimension characterizes the information displayed regarding the focal topic:
new contributions, old repetitions, null content (Chiu, 2000).
          During online discussions, contributions provide new information which might elicit more responses
than repetitions or null content, especially if the participants are focused on the content. Contributions are also
more likely to elicit disagreements than agreements in online discussions. As e-posters' concerns about threats to
face tend to be lower, they might express their disagreement more directly and explicitly (Dubrovsky, Kiesler, &
Sethna, 1991). Finally, contributions are also more likely to attract emotional concern and involvement during
online discussions (Patwardhan, 2004).
          In sum, contributions during online discussions might elicit more responses, more disagreements, and
more emotional responses compared to repetitions or null content messages.

Social cues
          The social cues of a message differ from the formal content of subject matter (Henri, 1992). During
online discussions, social cues can be positive, negative, or none. The effects of social cues on later messages in
FTF and   online  discussions   are likely  similar, though the   intensities might  differ.  In both FTF   and online
discussions, positive social cues tend to elicit positive social cues while negative social cues elicit negative ones.
While excessive social cues might distract from focus on the task (Walther, 1996) and reduce the number of
subsequent contributions, negative social cues might show a stronger negative effect than positive social cues.

Personal information
          Personal information    describes perceived  characteristics of a   person  that  exist prior to the FTF  or
online discussion. In online discussions, e-posters often portray a public image by choice of electronic name,
possibly other personal information, and past activity on the specific website. Personal information typically has
more surface validity in FTF discussions than in online discussions. Status effects are likely smaller in online
discussions compared to FTF discussions (Dubrovsky et al., 1991).

Elicitation
          Elicitation indicates whether or  not  other  e-posters responded    to a  specific message.  As  the mirror
image of evaluations (which link backwards to earlier turns), elicitations link forward to later turns to increase
the coherence of the discussion. As e-posters can respond to any message at any time, some messages receive
many responses, others receive none. In Thomas's (2002) study on 69 undergraduate students' online discussion,
he showed that over half students' contributions received no response, making the discussion incoherent and

                                                                                                                           1-1
         inefficient. So,  an e-poster  who  asked         a   question   but  didn't   get  response     might feel frustrated during  the
         discussion. Hence, elicitation reflects the importance of a message and its impact on the subsequent discussion.

       Method
        Data
                  In  this data set, 47 participants           posted 131    reply    messages    across  seven topics. These   topics were
         among  the   most  popular   discussions        on    the mathematics      board   of Peking     University BBS   Website  (URL:
         bbs.pku.edu.cn) from May to October, 2004. Messages on the seven topics ranged from 11 to 33. The discussion
         durations of the seven topics ranged from 14 hours to 106 hours. Peking University students are among the best
         students of China and are usually 18 to 30 years old (from undergraduate to postgraduate). Gender information
         was unknown.
                  Each of the seven topics focused on a problem proposed in the topic message. The topic message and
         its reply messages are linked to each other by multiple threads, single connections, and quotes of the previous
         message. See figure 1 for the relationship of messages in one of the seven topics. "0" in the circle indicates the
         initial topic message; "1" to "12" indicate 12 reply messages in order of posting time.

                                                                       0

                                                                                    9

                  Multiple threads. The topic message and 12 reply messages occur along five threads: (a) 0o1o2, (b)
         0o1o8o10o11, (c) 0o3o4, (d) 0o3o5o6o7o9, (e) 0o3o5o12. Messages in each thread are ordered
         by time, but they were not necessarily consecutive. In thread (d) for example, message 9 followed message 7
         and message 5 followed message 3.
                  Single connections. All messages in the topic were linked together by single connections. The forum's
         interface design constrained each of them to respond to only one earlier message. For example, message 9 only
         responded to message 7.
                  Quotes of the previous message. Along each single connected discussion thread, every reply message
         quoted the previous message to which it responded. Both messages can be read in the same computer window.
         For example, message 9 quoted message 7 under it, with message 7 in a lighter color.

        Variables
                  The set of variables for a single message included number of visits by each e-poster and the following
         binary variables:    agreement, disagreement,             contribution,      repetition,  social cue,  negative   social cue,  and
         elicitation. Values of zero for Agreement and Disagreement indicate an unresponsive action. Likewise, values of
         zero for Contribution   and  Repetition        indicate   Null   content.    Also,  values   of  one for Social  cue and  zero for
         Negative social cue indicate Positive social cue.
                  This analysis uses three sets of variables: properties of the current message (0), properties of earlier
         messages variables in the same thread (-n, where n = 1, 2, 3, ...), and properties of the next message (+1) in the
         same thread. For example, contribution (0) indicates whether the current message includes a new idea. Likewise,
         repetition (-1)   indicates whether the         previous     message   in    the   thread   repeated an  earlier message.  Lastly,
         elicitation (+1) indicates whether or not a message responded to the current message.

Current Variables (0)
         Current variables (0) were the variables that measured the property displayed in the current message,
e.g. contribution (0). The current variables (0) in this study are shown in table 2. Number of visits (0) was an
integer.

Table 2: Message properties to be examined in the study.

            Message properties                Example
            Agreement                         "I agree with you."; "Good answer. Can you say more?"
            Disagreement                      "I don't think so."; "That's partially right, but, ..."
            Unresponsive / new topic          "This reminds of an interesting story ..."
            Contribution                      "In my opinion, ..."; "we can multiply rate times time"
            Repetition                        "Yes, you're right. Two times six is twelve, not ten."
            Null content                      "Yes"; "Thank you"; "I don't understand"
            Positive social cue               "Excellent!"
            Negative social cue               "That's ridiculous!"
            Non-personal social cue           "Two times three equals six"
            Visits                            E-poster's visits on the BBS website, e.g., 791.

Lag Variables (-n)
         Past variables (-n) or lag variables (-n) (where n = 1, 2, 3, ...) measured the properties of messages
posted before the current message (except the topic message) in the same thread. Respectively, lag variables (-1)
measured the property of previous message such as repetition (-1) to which the current message responded; lag
variables (-2) measured the property of message two turns prior (to which the previous message responded); lag
variables (-3) measured the property of the message three turns prior; and so on.
         This study examined variables up to lag (-4) of each message as shown in table 2, as FTF research
suggests that lag variable effects can last for at least 3 turns (Chiu & Khoo, 2003). However, as variable (-n)
required data from earlier messages, they might not be available for some specific messages. For example, no
messages occurred before the topic message, so the topic message did not have any lag variables (-n).

Next Message Variable (+1)
         This study examined only one next message variable (+1), elicitation (+1). It measured whether the
current message elicited a later response or not and thus is a binary variable. A message eliciting no response
ends a thread.

Analyses
         To statistically analyze interactions among online messages, we must address three major concerns.
First, e-posters' behaviors and effects differ across topics, yielding nested data. Second, most variables in this
study are discrete, not continuous. Third, messages are often similar to recent events in time-series data, so the
values of variables tend to depend on the values of these variables from recent messages.
         Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions do not address these difficulties. Applied to nested data, OLS
often underestimates the standard errors of regression coefficients (Goldstein, 1995). For discrete variables, OLS
is inefficient and yields biased   results. Lastly, if the time-series relationships are not modeled      properly, the
model residuals can be serially correlated, resulting in inefficient parameter estimates and biased estimates of
the parameters' standard errors (Enders, 1995).
         Thus, we address these difficulties by using an extension of dynamic multilevel analysis (Chiu & Khoo,
2003, 2005). We test for topic differences, build an explanatory model, test for serial correlation, and model
direct and indirect effects. Extending Chiu and Khoo (2005), we also use a structural equation model to test all
predictor effects simultaneously.
          To test if the outcome variables significantly varied across topics, we used the software MLn
(Rasbash & Woodhouse, 1995) to create a multi-level Logit variance components model (Goldstein, 1995).
Consider a two-level model with an outcome variable, Yij (e.g., disagreement) at message i of topic j and a Logit
link function:
         Yij = E0 + eij + f0j

                                                                                                                          1-11
                                                             1
                   Sij = p (yij = 1) = F (E0 + f0j)   1  eE0  f0 j 

         The level-2 variation parameter f0j represents the deviation of topic j from the overall mean. The probability
         (Sij ) that an event (e.g. a disagreement) occurs at message i of topic j is determined by the expected value of the
         outcome variable and the Logit link function. Multi-level models separate unexplained error into message (level
         one) and    topic (level two)   components,    thereby  removing   the         correlation  among   error   terms resulting from
         messages nested within topics. If the variance components model shows significant variation at the topic level,
         then topics are heterogeneous and differ significantly from one another. Then, a two-level logit model and a
         two-level structural equation model (SEM) would be needed. If not, single level logit and SEM are sufficient.
                   For the outcome variable disagreement (0), we first added a vector (X) of x lag variables (-1) at the
         message   level:  visits (-1), agree (-1),  disagree  (-1), contribute         (-1), repeat (-1), social cue (-1), and   negative
         social cue (-1).

                   Sij = F(E0 + ExjX(i-1)j + f0j)

                   We tested whether this set of predictors was significant with a nested hypothesis test (F2 log likelihood,
         Cohen     & Cohen,   1983).    Then,   we    tested for  interaction          effects among    pairs of   significant   variables.
         Non-significant variables and interactions were removed from the specification. Next, we tested if the regression
         coefficients differed significantly (Goldstein, 1995) at the topic level. If yes, we kept these additional parameters
         in the model. Otherwise, we removed them.
                   Then, we entered variables measuring the property of earlier messages, first lag variables (-2), then lag
         variables (-3), and lastly, lag variables (-4). For example, the lag variables (-2) were: visits (-2), agree (-2),
         disagree (-2), contribute (-2), repeat (-2), social cue (-2), and negative social cue (-2). We repeated the above
         procedure used on lag variables (-1) for lag variables (-2), lag variables (-3) and lag variables (-4).

                   Sij = F(E0 + ExjX(i-1)j +IxjX(i-2)j +JxjX(i-3)j +KxjX(i-4)j + f0j)

                   The   likelihood  ratio test for  significance of  additional         explanatory  variables   is not reliable for  this
         estimation  method,    so  we  used  Wald    tests  (Goldstein, 1995).          Only  significant  variables  were   retained for
         subsequent regressions. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Doing many tests on one set of data
         can yield spurious correlations. To address this issue, we used Hochberg's (1988) variation on Holm's (1979)
         method.
                   We used Ljung & Box (1979) Q-statistics to test for serial correlation (up to order 4) in the residuals
         for all topics. If the residuals are not serially correlated, the parameter estimates are efficient and standard error
         estimates   are likely   unbiased  (Enders,   1995).  Otherwise,  we           add   lagged outcome  variables    as explanatory
         variables or model the serial correlation directly (see Goldstein, Healy, & Rasbash, 1994, for details).
                   We repeated the above procedure for three more outcome variables: contribution (0), social cue (0) and
         elicitation (+1). These    regression  results served  as   an initial        candidate for  the  multilevel structural  equation
         model, which estimates all predictor effects at the same time. Non-significant parameters were removed. To
         help the reader interpret these results, we converted the total effects of each predictor to odds ratios (Judge,
         Griffiths, Hill, Lutkepohl, & Lee, 1985).

        Results
                   The multi-level variance components analysis showed that topics did not differ significantly (variance
         at the topic level was not significant), so single-level analyses were adequate. See table 3 for regression results
         predicting disagreement, contribution, social cue, and elicitation. Aside from the predictors discussed below, all
         other predictors showed non-significant effects.

Predicting disagreement
            If the previous message was a disagreement (-1) or a contribution (-1), the current message was more
likely to   include    a    disagreement.  Disagreement     (-1)  and  contribution    (-1)   explained  about  27%    of  the
disagreement variance at the message level. Disagreement in the previous message explained at most 17% of the
disagreement variance in the current message. Contribution in the previous message accounted for about 10%.

Predicting contribution
            Visits (-1)  and  social   cue (-2) significantly  predicted   a contribution   in the   current message.   If the
previous message was posted by an e-poster with many visits (visits[-1]), the current message was more likely
to have a contribution. Meanwhile, a social cue (-2) ago reduced the likelihood of a contribution in the current
message.    These     two   predictors explained about  15%    of  the contribution   variance    at the message   turn level.
Previous e-poster's visits (-1) explained at most 9% of the contribution variance. Social cue (-2) accounted for
about 6%.

Predicting social cue
            Disagreement (-1) and contribution (-1) in the previous message positively predicted a social cue in the
current message. These two predictors explained about 15% of the social cue variance at the message turn level.
Disagreement in previous message explained at most 8% of the social cue variance. Contribution in previous
message accounted for about 7%.

Predicting elicitation
            Fifty-five percent of the messages received responses, while forty-five percent did not. Disagreement
and contribution in the current message entered alone into the regression were significant, but together, only
disagreement was significant. Disagreement and contribution in a message were significantly correlated (r [131]
= 0.37, p < 0.01). Disagreement in the current message explained at most 7% of the elicitation variance.

Predicting disagreement, social cue and elicitation in an SEM
            Based  on   the  above  results, we  used  an   SEM    to test the  direct and    indirect effects of  the  earlier
messages. Non-significant effects in the SEM were removed. The final model is shown in figure 2. The SEM
showed a good fit (F2 [df = 5, N = 109] = 8.19, incremental fit index (IFI) = 0.97, comparative fit index (CFI) =
0.97,  non-normed       fit index   (NNFI)   =  0.95, root  mean   squared   error  of approximation      (RMSEA)    =   0.07,
standardized    root   mean   residual  [SRMR]   =  0.04;  for discussion    of fit criteria, see Hu   &  Bentler, 1999).  As
expected, the SEM effects were consistent with the regression results. Disagreement (-1) and contribution (-1) in
previous message had direct positive effects on disagreement and social cue in current message. Disagreement
and contribution in a message were also significantly correlated in the model (r [109] = 0.37, p < 0.05). Only
disagreement       in the   current message     showed  a   direct effect    on elicitation   (+1).  Disagreement   (-1)   and
contribution (-1) in the previous message affected the current message's elicitation indirectly.

       Discussion
                  Previous studies explored individual aspects of online discussion messages in course related forums
         (e.g., Hara et al., 2000; Garrison et al., 2001; Schellens & Valcke, 2005). Extending this line of research, we
         examined   how   evaluations,   knowledge    content,   social cues     and personal   information   in earlier  messages
         affected later messages  to  identify   the relationships  among     them   and  to characterize the  flow  of  the   online
         discussion. Specifically, we examined online discussions in an independent and voluntary academic forum on a
         university BBS Website. The results showed that disagreement, contribution, social cue, and past visits of an
         e-poster in earlier messages can affect the properties of a subsequent message. After discussing these results, we
         consider their implications for improving online discussions.
                  Disagreements often occurred after prior disagreements and contributions in this study. A message that
         disagrees with an earlier message yielded further disagreements, consistent with Chiu and Khoo's (2003) FTF
         interaction result. Unlike FTF interactions however, disagreements did not seem to threaten the continuation of
         the discussion, as disagreements raised the likelihood of later e-posters' responses. These effects suggest that
         online  discussions  are suited  to  controversial  topics.    Like  Chiu   &   Khoo's    (2003) FTF    interaction   result,
         disagreements also occurred more often after contributions, showing that proposing a new idea is more likely to
         receive a critical response rather than supportive one. Also, the SEM showed that disagreement and contribution
         in the previous message were significantly correlated when predicting current disagreement. It implies that if an
         e-poster is about to disagree, he or she often anticipates a disagreement and thus often elaborates with more
         information. Together, these results are consistent with the claim that online discussion forums can promote
         critical thinking (Garrison et al., 2000, 2001).
                  Both disagreement and contribution in the previous message positively predicted a social cue in the
         current  message.  This  result suggests  that  in online  discussions,   disagreements    and new   ideas  tend   to cause
         stronger emotional responses and engagement compared to other types of messages. Also, disagreements and
         contributions elicited more responses, suggesting that messages are more provocative and engaged students to
         respond.  Furthermore,   these  results showed     that messages    with  critical  thinking were  more   popular,    which
         supports the claim that online discussion forum can promote critical thinking (Garrison et al., 2000, 2001).
                  There were also several notable non-significant results. Contrary to Walter's (1996) and Henri's (1992)
         arguments,  social  cues did not  substantially    affect the behaviors   studied.  Furthermore,   status  in  the form  of
         number   of visits  was  linked   to more    contributions,    suggesting   that   experienced   e-posters  elicited  more
         contributions. However,   agreements    did  not   occur  more    often after messages    by e-posters  with   more   visits.
         Likewise disagreements were not less likely after messages by e-posters with more visits. Together, these results
         support our hypothesis that status effects are weaker in online discussions than in FTF discussions.

       Implications
                  This study suggested that teachers and researchers might use online academic discussion in three ways.
                  Developing   controversial   discussions.  As    participants  were   likely  to engage  in  and   sustain   online
         discussion on topics that involved many disagreements, teachers might help students learn and think critically
         by using online forums for discussion of controversial topics, e.g., new hypotheses or problems with contested
         answers.
                  Reducing status effects. As experience status effects are much weaker in online discussions than in FTF
         discussions. If status effects are a serious problem in classroom interactions, online discussions among multiple
         classes (or schools) or perhaps with pseudonyms might mitigate these status effects.
                  Managing    online  discussions    at message    level.  In addition   to  encouraging   student   to participate,
         teachers may also manage the online academic discussions for specific purposes at message level. For example,
         teachers  can  post anonymous     messages     containing  disagreements      and  contributions  to elicit more    student
         responses.
