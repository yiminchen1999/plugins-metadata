                 Abstract:    This   study  examines      how   social  metacognition     (including evaluations    and
                 questions)  affected   micro-creativity   during  group  problem    solving. Twenty   groups   of high
                 school students were videotaped as they solved a mathematics problem. Analyses of the 2,951
                 conversation     turns showed   that  the likelihood  of a correct  contribution (CC,  a  measure    of
                 micro-creativity) was higher after a group member expressed a wrong, new idea, correctly
                 evaluated an idea, or justified an idea. In contrast, the likelihood of a CC was lower after a
                 group member disagreed rudely or agreed. Meanwhile, group-level properties (racial diversity,
                 gender diversity, and degree of status differences) did not significantly affect the likelihood of
                 a CC. A CC was more likely after a justification in successful groups than in unsuccessful
                 groups. CCs did not occur uniformly, as some time periods had many CCs while others had
                 few CCs. Furthermore, agreements and correct evaluations had different effects across time
                 periods within a group.

                 Past research on the development of original ideas that are useful or influential (creativity) has largely
         focused on individuals (Sternberg & Lubart, 1999). However, the explosion of information and specializations
         will increasingly  require  teams  with   diverse  skills and  knowledge    to  create  innovations   (group creativity;
         Sawyer,    2004). Still, researchers    have  not systematically   examined    how   group  processes    affect  creative
         moments (group micro-creativity). This study takes a step in this direction by analyzing how micro-creativity
         occurs in twenty groups of students solving an algebra problem. By understanding how group processes affect
         micro-creativity, group members can work together more creatively.
                 In this paper, creativity refers to the "small c" creativity of ordinary people in daily life, not the "big C"
         creativity of new   knowledge     or    products  that substantially  affect  society   (Sternberg  &    Lubart, 1999).
         Furthermore, micro-creativity is measured via a correct, new idea (correct contribution, CC). Hence, the CC's
         "new" component is relative to the group members' experiences. The CC's "correct" component refers to the
         intersection of the problem situation and the relevant field's principles (in this case, algebra). Thus, a CC is a
         new idea for the group members that is consistent with both the given problem situation and algebra principles.
                 I  modeled   group,    student, and  speaker   turn characteristics that helped  or hindered   micro-creativity
         during group problem solving in a high school algebra class. This study contributes to the research literature in
         four ways. First, I showed when CCs occur, whether they occur uniformly through a problem-solving session or
         more frequently in some time periods than in others. Second, this study showed how the local time context
         created by prior speakers' actions (CCs, justifications, etc.) and interactions affected the likelihood of creating a
         CC. Third, I tested whether the above effects differed across groups or across time periods. Lastly, I tested these
         hypotheses with a new statistical discourse analysis method, dynamic multilevel analysis (Chiu & Khoo, 2005).

       Group processes and micro-creativity
                 Diverse views and social metacognition can aid CC creation (Chiu, in press; Paulus & Brown, 2003).
         Meanwhile, public self-image (face) and status concerns can hinder creation of CCs (Brown & Levinson, 1987).

        Group problem solving processes that aid micro-creativity
        Diversity
                 Groups    with   diverse views   can  create   more   ideas. Specifically, group    diversity in  nationality or
         ethnicity can increase the number of perspectives, number of ideas, and quality of ideas (McLeod, Lobel, &
         Cox, 1996). Furthermore, groups that create many ideas, representations, and solution proposals, are more likely
         to find a correct or optimal solution (Paulus & Brown, 2003).
                 Group     members   with  diverse    views can   also build  on idiosyncratic   ideas to  create  CCs    through
         processes such as sparked ideas, jigsaw pieces, and creative misinterpretations (Paulus & Brown, 2003; Chiu,
         1997). Comments by one person (e.g., a key word) might spark another person to activate related concepts in his
         or her semantic network and propose a CC. Like fitting jigsaw pieces together, group members also can put
         together different pieces to create a CC. Lastly, a person might also misinterpret another person's incorrect idea
         to create a CC. Thus, even wrong, new ideas can lead to CCs.
                 Group     members'     diverse  views can   help  identify   flaws  and  refine incorrect  ideas.  (Orlitzky  &
         Hirokawa, 2001). By creating more ideas (including wrong ideas) and evaluating their validity correctly, groups

1-1
are more likely to create CCs. Hence, group members need not only build on correct ideas.

Social Metacognition
         Social   metacognition.   Successful    group   problem   solving   often involves  social  metacognition     and
justifications in the cognitive/problem content space (Roschelle, 1992; Teasley & Roschelle, 1993). Whereas
individual metacognition is monitoring and controlling one's own knowledge (Hacker & Bol, 2004), emotions,
and actions,   social  metacognition   is  group  members'     monitoring  and   control of  one another's    knowledge,
emotions, and actions. Students use social metacognitive strategies to evaluate one another's ideas and recognize
problems. In response to other group members' monitoring, people often justify their own views to convince
others (Amason, 1996; Cobb, 1995).
         According     to the  functional  theory    of group    decision-making,  group  members      at least implicitly
evaluate the   previous   speaker's   action and    problem    solving  approach   (Orlitzky &   Hirokawa,    2001).    For
example, Jay says "five times six is eleven." Kay can agree ("right"), use a neutral action ("louder, can't hear
you"),  disagree  ("no,   you're  wrong"),   or  change    the   topic ("I'm hungry").   While   agreements     encourage
continuation   of the  current   problem-solving     trajectory, disagreements,   and changes   of   topic  (ignoring   the
previous action) try to change this trajectory (Chiu, 2000).
         Evaluations can also be right or wrong in some contexts (e.g., algebra problems). Correct evaluations
support  correct  ideas   ("yes, five times  six is  thirty,") or identify flawed   ideas ("No!  Five     times six is  not
eleven,"), and thus, can help create a shared knowledge base that group members might use to build new CCs.
In contrast, incorrect evaluations reject CCs ("wrong, five times six is NOT thirty,") or accept flawed ideas
("right, five times six is seven,"), embedding flaws in their shared knowledge base. Group members using this
shared knowledge base might bring these flaws into their new ideas, resulting in wrong ideas rather than CCs. A
group's collective attention and diverse perspectives can help it evaluate ideas correctly and create a shared
knowledge base to aid creation of CCs (Chiu, 2000).
         When group members recognize problems or difficulties (perturbations), they can disagree or ask a
question (Piaget, 1985). Piaget (1985) defined two types of perturbations: (a) obstacles, which give negative
feedback and (b) lacunae, gaps in understanding. Disagreements indicate obstacles to be overcome (e.g., "no,
that's wrong, five times six isn't eleven"). Thus, disagreements can show the need for CCs and identify flaws to
avoid, thereby motivating and aiding the creation of CCs.
         Meanwhile, a question (e.g., Jay asks, "what's five times eight?") might indicate an individual gap or a
group gap. For an individual gap question, other group members who know the answer can help her (e.g., Kay
says "forty"). Thus, individual gap questions encourage review of old ideas rather than the creation of CCs. In
contrast, no one knows the answer to a group gap question, which motivates the need for a CC and points to a
new  direction    for creating   one. Group   members'     diverse  views  and   levels  of  knowledge     facilitate  both
perturbations and responses to them. In short, these perturbations can motivate and inform creation of CCs.
         After perturbations provoke new ideas, group members often justify themselves. Chiu and Khoo (2003)
showed that members of successful groups often anticipated criticisms and justified their new ideas. Likewise,
after a person disagrees with a proposal (e.g. Kay), the original proposer (Jay) might try to justify it by linking it
to data, using a warrant, or supporting a warrant with backing. In response, other members can present different
views and justifications (Piaget's, 1985, genuine argument). Similarly, when Jay shows a gap in understanding
by  asking a   question,  other  members     can respond   with   explanations   and  justifications (Piaget,   1985).  As
justifications support the validity of an idea, they might help create CCs.

Group problem solving actions that hinder micro-creativity
         Research on politeness suggests that disagreeing politely might aid creation of CCs but disagreeing
rudely might hinder creation of CCs. When arguments spill over from the cognitive arena into the social arena,
groups members might protect their public self-images (face) rather than further the problem solving (Brown &
Levinson, 1987). Status differences can further aggravate these face concerns.

Face and rudeness
         Each type of evaluation has implications for both the problem solving (as noted above) and for the
previous speaker's face (Chiu, 2000). Evaluations range from polite to rude: agreement, neutral, change of topic,
and disagreements (Chiu, 2000). Consider Jay's utterance again, "five times six is eleven." If Kay agrees with
Jay ("right"), she    supports him,   promotes   his face, and   enhances  their social  relationship, especially   if they
invest themselves in their ideas (Brown & Levinson, 1987). Thus, members often agree with one another and
repeat shared information to create common ground and solidarity (Chiu, 2000).
         In contrast, other actions do not support face. Neutral actions include many discourse management or
meta-discourse    actions (e.g.,  "louder, can't  hear   you").  Although    changes  of topic ("I'm   hungry")     can be
neutral, they can be rude if the previous speaker (Jay) expects a response. For example, if Jay asks, "three times
four is seven?" and Kay says "I'm hungry," she either ignores him or does not listen to him, both of which are

                                                                                                                              1-1
         rude. Lastly, disagreements (e.g., "no, you're wrong") can threaten face by lowering public perception of the
         previous speaker's (Jay's) competence (Brown & Levinson, 1987).
                  When a person disagrees (e.g., Kay), the target person (Jay) ideally tries to understand the criticism and
         use  it productively   to   create a CC.   However,    the  threat to  Jay's   face may  ignite his  impulse  to  retaliate
         emotionally (face attack, "no, you're wrong," Chiu & Khoo, 2003). Thus, rude disagreements threaten face,
         escalate interpersonal conflict, and often hinder creation and recognition of CCs. In this hostile environment,
         group members might withhold CCs or correct evaluations rather than risk losing face (Chiu, 2000). In the worst
         case, a spiral of rude disagreements can end the collaboration (Chiu & Khoo, 2003).
                  To avoid threatening Jay's face, Kay might go to the opposite extreme and publicly agree. By doing so,
         Kay enhances her social relationship with Jay at the expense of their problem solving. Such false agreements
         allow errors to persist and potential CCs to remain unspoken. Also, group members might avoid disagreeing
         with one another due to pressure to achieve premature consensus (Janis, 1989).
                  Avoiding the extremes of rude disagreement and false agreement, Kay can disagree politely to reduce
         the threat to Jay's face while maintaining problem solving integrity (Chiu & Khoo, 2003). Instead of "no, you're
         wrong," Kay can disagree politely, "If five is multiplied by six, we don't get seven." The polite disagreement
         both reduces blame and creates common ground. First, Kay uses the hypothetical "if," thereby distancing the
         idea from   reality. Second,    she  does  not  assign   blame  (no  "you").   Third,  Kay uses    the passive  voice, "is
         multiplied," to   hide causal   agency   and responsibility. Lastly,   she uses  the  passive  circumstantial verb   "get,"
         thereby implicating agency in external conditions.
                  Kay's polite disagreement creates common ground by repetition and shared positioning. By repeating
         Jay's computation, "five is multiplied by six . . . eleven," Kay suggests that she shares his understanding. Also,
         Kay uses shared positioning, specifically the first person plural pronoun "we," to claim common cause with Jay.
                  Kay's polite disagreement supports her relationship with Jay, so he is less likely to retaliate. Instead,
         Jay is more likely to try to understand Kay's criticism, recognize the flaw, and correct it with a CC (Chiu &
         Khoo, 2003). Indeed, the benefits of polite disagreements are so strong that it is the accepted norm among peers,
         as lack of redress during a disagreement is noticeably rude and unacceptable (Holtgraves, 1997). In short, polite
         disagreements can support both the social relationship and the micro-creativity.

        Status
                  Status differences can reduce CCs and distort evaluations of CCs through status struggles (Bales, 2001)
         or through the greater influence of high status members (Cohen, 1994). Cohen (1994) defined status as "an
         agreed-on rank order where it is generally felt to be better to be high than low rank" (p. 23). As a higher status
         person   often  receives   more   group  resources    and attention,  people   often  compete   for higher   status (status
         struggles), especially    if no   status hierarchy    has been  established    (Bales,  2001).  During  status  struggles,
         intentional rude disagreements (face attacks; e.g., "everyone knows that five times six is thirty, not eleven") can
         enhance   one's own    face  at the  expense of  a competitor's    face (Chiu   &   Khoo, 2003).   As  noted earlier, rude
         disagreements can hinder creation of CCs.
                  After    a status   hierarchy has  been   established, status  affects  the   expectations of  individual   group
         members (Cohen, 1994). In expectation states theory, status is linked to the expectation of competencies for the
         current  activity   (Cohen,  1994).  High  status  is conferred  on  group   members    who   are  expected  to contribute
         positively  to  a   desired  outcome.  These   expectations  create    different opportunities  to  perform   and   receive
         rewards.  Members      can   selectively invite and   defer  to high    status members'   opinions   while  discouraging,
         undervaluing,   or   outright   ignoring  lower   status  members'    ideas,   thereby  distorting  evaluations  to   agree
         excessively with high status people's ideas and disagree excessively with low status people's ideas. By doing so,
         members enact their expectations of high status members dominating the interaction and increase the ratio of
         flaws to correct ideas in the group's shared knowledge base. High status people's influence can also increase
         over time. High status people speak early and often (Hackman & Johnson, 2000). As group members value and
         prefer supporting previously discussed or shared information rather than introducing unshared information, high
         status people's domination increases in severity over time (Stasser & Birchmeier, 2003).
                  Greater status differences can exacerbate status effects or raise the incentives for status struggles, both
         of which   might    reduce   CCs.  For group  problem     solving, the  primary  status characteristic is often  past task
         achievement, but group members might also use diffuse status characteristics (such as social status) to make
         assumptions about one another's competence.
                  In short, we have the following micro-creativity hypotheses.
                  H1. Groups with more diversity (race, gender) create more CCs.
                  H2. New ideas, whether correct or incorrect, help create CCs.
                  H3. Social metacognition (correct evaluations, disagreements, questions) facilitates CC creation.
                  H4. Rude disagreements and false agreements hinder creation of CCs while polite disagreements aid
                  the creation of CCs.
                  H5. Greater status differences (achievement, social status) reduce CCs.

Method
Participants
        Eighty students in an urban US high school participated in this study. The students attended four ninth
grade algebra   classes  for seven  months.   On  a state-wide exam,   the school  scored  between      the 40th to 50th
percentiles in mathematics. These students had not received any group training and had not worked together.
        All 80 students answered two questions regarding social status, "Who are 3 classmates you would most
like to hang out with? Name 3 classmates who are the easiest for you to talk with outside of school work." Then,
these students were placed into groups of four. There was no same gender or same race groups. There were 40
girls and 40 boys; their races were 12 Asian, 27 Black, 28 Hispanic, and 13 White.

Procedure
        The teacher presented the following problem to the students in their algebra classes: "You won a cruise
from New York to London, but you arrive 5 hours late. So, the ship left without you. To catch the ship, you rent
a helicopter. The ship travels at 22 miles an hour. The helicopter moves at 90 miles an hour. How long will it
take you to catch the ship?"
        The teacher used this problem to introduce them to a new unit on algebraic equations with multiple
variables.  Hence,   the students   had   not yet  learned, in class,  any  procedures    for solving     this problem.
Furthermore, the problem involved complicated mathematics relationships, non-trivial combinations of multiple
operations, and many solution methods. One solution method is equating the distance computations for each
vehicle, cruise ship and helicopter (22 mph x [Time + 5 hours] = 90 mph x Time), to obtain 1.618 hours or 1
hour 37 minutes.
        The students worked in groups for 30 minutes. They had pens, paper, and calculators available for their
use. All students were videotaped, and the subsequent data were transcribed and coded.

Variables
        This    study included  the following   individual, group,  and  time  period  variables.  Students    identified
themselves as girls or boys and as Asian, Black, Latino or White. Mathematics grade refers to students' mid-
year algebra grades. Each student's peer friendship measure was the mean number of times his or her name
appeared on classmates' answers to two social status questions. Group variables included the group means and
variances of the above variables. Each group's final answer was coded as correct or wrong (1 or 0; solution
score). Each group's problem solving session was also divided into time periods according to the DMA method
described below. The number of time periods in a group ranged from one to five.
        The transcripts of the videotapes were divided into sequences of words or actions by the same person
(speaker turns). Blind to the study's hypotheses, two research assistants coded all the transcripts' speaker turns.
Krippendorff's (2004) D was used to test for inter-coder reliability.
        A speaker turn is a sequence of words by a group member bracketed by the words of other group
member(s).  A   turn  could  also  consist of only  non-verbal actions  (e.g., writing "3 x 40").    In contrast to flat
classification schemes   that only  allow  one  or  two codes  for each  speaker  utterance   (e.g., Bales,  2001), the
research assistants coded each turn along the five dimensions suggested by these turn properties: evaluation of
the previous action (EPA: agree, ignore, rudely disagree, politely disagree), knowledge content (KC: new idea
[contribution],  old  idea [repetition], null problem   content), validity (correct,  wrong,  null   problem   content),
justification, and invitational form  (IF:  command,    question, statement),  (Chiu, 2000).  A   correct   contribution
(CC) is a new idea relative to the group members that is consistent with both the problem situation and algebra.
With limited knowledge about the group members' experiences, a turn was coded as a contribution if it was not
in the problem statement, not in the textbook, and not discussed earlier during the lesson.

Data Analysis
        Statistical analysis of group processes at the speaker turn/utterance level is problematic as it involves
time-series data   and   multiple  groups.  Time-series  data  collected   from different groups     often  violate the
independence assumption. Also, the effects of the explanatory variables on the outcome variable can change
over  time  (non-stationarity)  or differ  across groups (group   heterogeneity). This  study  uses     a new   method,
dynamic multi-level analysis (DMA, Chiu & Khoo, 2005) to solve all of these difficulties: (a) identify distinct
time periods, (b) test for group heterogeneity and time period stationarity, (c) multilevel analysis of the binary
outcome variable, (d) test for residual serial correlation, and (e) identify direct and indirect effects.
        Within a problem solving session, there might be fewer CCs at the beginning time period when people
are trying to understand the problem than at later time periods when they are close to a solution. Hence, DMA
identified watershed breakpoints that divided the time series data into time periods with significantly more or
fewer CCs. For each group, I used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in a modified version of Maddala
and Kim's (1998) method. The BIC measured whether a model has both goodness of fit and a parsimonious

                                                                                                                            1-1
         specification. In a regression of the outcome variable, CC, possible breakpoints serve as independent variables,
         and the BIC is computed for a simple time-series model (an auto-regressive order 1 model).
                 yt = C + C2 d2 + C3 d3 + ... + Cp dp + E yt1 + Ht                                                    (1)
                 The parameter yt indicates the value of the outcome variable y at speaker turn t. The parameter yt1
         indicates the value of the outcome variable in the previous turn, and E is its regression coefficient. Meanwhile, C
         is a constant, and Ht is the residual at turn t. Each time period p has a dummy variable dp and a regression
         coefficient Cp. Assuming zero to five breakpoints and calculating the BICs for all possible locations of those
         break points, the optimal model has the lowest BIC. Applying this method to each group yielded the number and
         locations of breakpoints (and hence time periods) for each group.
                 A multi-level Logit model can be divided into its multi-level part and its Logit part. Consider a 3-level
         model with an outcome variable, yijk (CC) at speaker turn i of time period j in group k and a Logit link function:
                 yijk = E000 + eijk + f0jk + g00k                                                                              (2)
                                                                           1
                 Sijk = p (yijk = 1) = F (E0 + f0jk + g00k)      1  eE0 f0 jk g00k                                            (3)
                 The level-2 variation parameter f0jk is the deviation of time period j from the overall mean, and g00k is
        the deviation of group k from the overall mean E000. The probability (Sijk) that an event (e.g. a CC) occurs at turn
         i of time period j in group k is a function of the expected value of the outcome variable and the Logit link
         function. As the level-1 variation, eijk, does not contribute to the fixed components and is a random variable only
         at level 1, it is constrained to 1 without loss of generality.
                 yijk = Sijk + eijk[Sijk( 1- Sijk) ]0.5                                                                        (4)
                 The full analysis with all vectors of variables is shown in equation 5.

                 First, a vector of s classroom identification control variables was added (S). As the likelihood ratio test
         for the significance of additional explanatory variables was not reliable for this estimation method, Wald tests
         were used (Goldstein, 1995). Non-significant variables were removed from the specification at each stage.
                 Then,    t variables at the  group       level  were    added: correct group  solution, mean   of group  members'
         mathematics grades, mean of group members' social statuses, variance of mathematics grades, variance of social
         statuses, racial variance, gender variance (T). The last two pairs of variables tested the status effects hypothesis
         (H5) and the diversity hypothesis (H1). Then, interactions among pairs of significant variables in T were added.
         Next, u current speaker variables was added: gender, race, mathematics grade, social status, correct evaluation,
         agree, politely  disagree, rudely  disagree,       justify, question   and command    (U). Then,   the speaker   turn level
         regression coefficients were tested for significant differences (Goldstein, 1995).
                 I entered lag variables for the previous speakers (namely, a vector autoregression or VAR, Kennedy,
         2004), first lag 1 (indicating the previous turn and denoted -1), then at lag 2 (denoted -2), then at lag 3, and so on
         until none of the variables in the last lag were significant (lag 4 in this case). First, I added v previous speaker
         variables at the speaker turn level: gender (­1), race (­1), mathematics grade (­1), social status (­1), correct
         evaluation (­1),   agree (­1),  politely       disagree (­1),   rudely disagree (­1), CC (­1),  wrong   contribution  (­1),
         correct old idea (­1), justify (­1), question (­1), and command (­1) (V). These variables tested the new ideas,
         social metacognition, and rudeness hypotheses (H2, H3, and H4). Then, lags ­2, ­3, and ­4 of the variables in V
         were added. The parameters were estimated with predictive quasi-likelihood methods (Goldstein, 1995).
                 Ljung-Box (1979) Q-statistics were used to test for serial correlation (up to order 4) in the residuals. If
         the residuals are  not serially correlated,       the   parameter estimates  are likely efficient, and the  standard  error
         estimates are likely unbiased (Kennedy, 2004). Otherwise, lagged outcome variables (lags of CC) can be added
         as explanatory variables, or the serial correlation can be modeled (Kennedy, 2004).
                 Based on the multilevel analysis results, the path analysis estimated the direct and indirect effects of the
         significant explanatory variables (Kennedy, 2004). As time constrains the direction of causality, the explanatory
         variables were entered in temporal order into the path analysis. To facilitate interpretation of these results, the
         total effects of each predictor were converted to odds ratios, reported as the percentage increase or decrease (+
         X% or ­ X%) in the likelihood of a CC (Kennedy, 2004).
                 An alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests. The false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled
         via Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli's (2006) two-stage linear step-up procedure, as their computer simulations
         showed  that  it was superior   to 13    other    methods.    I also estimated  the accuracy of  the final model's micro-
         creativity predictions in each turn.

       Results
                 As shown in an earlier analysis of this data, groups with a larger percentage of CCs had higher solution
         scores (Chiu & Khoo, in press). Thus, DMA was used CC creation. DMA identified watershed breakpoints that
         distinguished time   periods of frequent        CCs   and infrequent   CCs. Preliminary  examination   of  the breakpoints

1-1
suggest three broad types (on-task l off-task transitions, insights, and critical errors). These time periods were
incorporated    into  the explanatory  models   of  CCs.   Krippendorf's  alpha  for  evaluations   of previous  actions,
knowledge content, correctness, and invitational form were 0.93, 0.98, 0.99, and 0.91 respectively.

        Supported Hypotheses
        H2. Wrong, new ideas aid micro-creativity.
        H3. Social metacognition (correct evaluations and disagreements ­if polite) aids micro-creativity.
        H4. Rude disagreements and false agreements hinder micro-creativity.
        Polite disagreements aid micro-creativity.

         Group properties did not affect the likelihood of a CC. CC creation was not linked to greater racial
diversity, gender diversity, or status differences (showing no support for H1 or H5).
         In contrast, recent speaker actions (constituting the local time context) affected the likelihood of CCs.
Wrong,  new     ideas yielded  more   CCs   (+9%;  see Figure 1),  but prior  CCs   did not  yield  more   CCs, showing
partial support for H2. After a wrong idea, group members were less likely to agree (­18%) and more likely to
rudely disagree (+6%). Furthermore, they often detected and corrected errors to create a CC (e.g., "should be
two hours, not five hours"). Surprisingly, a CC did not help create subsequent CCs. Thus, these groups had few
chain reactions of CCs in this study.
         When group members evaluated correctly or justified ideas, the likelihood of CCs increased, so the
results partially supported H3. If any of the three previous speakers evaluated correctly (­1, ­2, ­3), the current
speaker was more likely to create a CC (+2%, +5%, and +3%, respectively). Furthermore, a group member who
evaluated correctly    often  helped  subsequent    speakers evaluate   correctly,  both  in the next   turn   and in  the
following turn   (+12%     and +14%,   respectively).  Also, group    members  who    evaluated  correctly  helped   other
group members justify their ideas (+3%), create fewer wrong ideas (­3%) and agree more often (+2%).
         When group members justified ideas, the likelihood of a CC rose substantially in unsuccessful groups
(+29%)  and   rose    even higher  in successful groups    (+70%). This   difference  might  stem   from   successful  and
unsuccessful    group  members'    different  sources  for justifying  their ideas.  Successful  group     members   often
referred to the "RTD" (rate u time = distance formula) and other mathematics formulas to justify their ideas. In
contrast, unsuccessful group members often referred to the teacher "because Ms. T said so," which might be less
valid or less helpful to other group members. When a group member justified an idea, other group members
were less likely   to  disagree rudely  (­5%)    and  more  likely to  follow with   justifications (+4%).   Meanwhile,
asking a question did not significantly affect the likelihood of a CC, and the effect of disagreeing depended on
whether a group member disagreed politely or rudely.
         Disagreements did not always increase CC creation (no support for this part of H3). Instead, polite
disagreements    increased   CC    creation (+14%),  while   rude  disagreements    reduced  it (­4%).     Controlling for
correct evaluations,   excessive   agreement   also  reduced  CC   creation  (­5%).   These  effects   all supported   H4.
(Other predictors were not significant.)
         Only two predictors showed different effects across time periods (agree and correct evaluation [­2]).
Agreements yielded fewer CCs, with the effects varying across time periods from ­3% to ­21% (­5% overall).
Correct evaluation (­2) generally yielded more CCs, with the effect varying across time periods from ­0.3% to
+9% (+5% overall). The varying effect sizes of agreement and correct evaluations across time periods suggested
that their effects were moderated by unexamined variables that differed across these time contexts. Aside from
justifications, agreements,    and  correct  evaluations   (­2),  the effects of all  other  predictors    did not   differ
significantly across time periods or across groups, and thus showed no evidence of contextual effects.
         This model had an 83% accuracy rate for predicting whether a CC occurred in any given turn (yijk* vs.
yijk). Furthermore, the Q-statistics showed no significant serial correlation of residuals in any of the twenty
groups. So, the time-series model was likely appropriate.

Discussion
         Diverse     views and  social metacognition   might  facilitate  creativity  while  concerns  over  public   self-
image (face) or status might hinder it (Paulus & Brown, 2003). This study tested the group micro-creativity
versions of these hypotheses using a statistical discourse analysis. While a group's local time context affected its
micro-creativity, a priori individual and group characteristics did not, highlighting the importance of examining
actual  group   member     actions and interactions  rather  than  inferring  them   from coarser   group   or individual
measures. Specifically, the likelihood of a correct, new idea (correct contribution or CC) was higher after a (a)
wrong,  new     idea, (b)  correct evaluation, (c)  justification or  (d) a  politely disagreement.    In  contrast,  rude
disagreement and excessive agreement were both linked to lower CC creation. CC creation was not linked to
racial diversity, gender diversity, or status differences. The effects of justifications differed across groups, while
those of agreements and correct evaluations differed across time periods.
         Greater CC creation after wrong ideas, correct evaluations, and polite disagreements suggest that social

                                                                                                                              1-1
         metacognition  often aids  micro-creativity.  After   a wrong  idea,  group  members    agreed   less often  and  rudely
         disagreed  more  often,  suggesting  that   they detected  the  flaw  in the  wrong    idea. Furthermore,    they   often
         corrected the flaw to yield a CC. Thus, wrong, new ideas might have served as kindling for micro-creativity via
         sparked ideas,   jigsaw pieces,  or  creative misinterpretations     (Chiu, 1997).  In contrast,  a   CC did  not   raise
         subsequent CC creation in this study, suggesting that chain reactions of micro-creativity might not be common
         in similar situations. Unlike CCs, correct evaluations had long-term effects on CC creation. Correct evaluations
         increased subsequent    correct evaluations,  justifications, and  CC   creation over  three  turns.  These  results are
         consistent with the view that verifying correct ideas or identifying flaws helps create a shared, valid knowledge
         base for subsequent group micro-creativity.
                 Meanwhile,    justifications reduced     rude   disagreements   and  yielded   more   justifications and    CCs,
         suggesting  that justifications aid rational  discourse  and  micro-creativity.  By  encouraging     polite discussions,
         justifications focus attention on the validity of an idea and encourage further justifications and CC creation.
                 Social   metacognition   did  not   always   raise micro-creativity,   likely  because    group  members     are
         concerned about face. While disagreements can identify obstacles for the group to address (Piaget, 1985), rude
         disagreements reduce CC creation, whereas polite disagreements increase CC creation. Furthermore, excessive
         agreement yielded fewer CCs, consistent with the view that group members agreed excessively to enhance their
         social relationships at the expense of their micro-creativity (Janis, 1989).
                 This study showed significant differences across groups and across time periods. Successful groups had
         justifications that were more effective in yielding CCs. Meanwhile, many CCs were clustered together as time
         period variation   accounted for  79%    of  the total  variance. Also,  the effect sizes  of   agreement   and  correct
         evaluations varied across time periods.
                 If  future studies validate  these   results across   problem   content, contexts,   and  group  histories,  this
         exploratory  study   might   have    the  following     theoretical,  methodological,   and   practical     implications.
         Theoretically, this study suggests that understanding group micro-creativity requires explicating the influence of
         both the time period and the local time context. Watershed breakpoints (on-task l off-task transitions, insights,
         and critical errors) separated   time  periods    of  high micro-creativity   from   those   of  low  micro-creativity.
         Furthermore,   the local time   context   of  recent   group  member    actions  (wrong   ideas,  correct   evaluations,
         justifications, agreements, and rude disagreements) influenced the degree of micro-creativity. Methodologically,
         a new statistical discourse analysis (dynamic multi-level analysis, DMA, Chiu & Khoo, 2005) identified the
         watershed  breakpoints   and aided   testing  of the   micro-creativity hypotheses.    With  this new   statistical tool,
         scholars can test many categories of hypotheses about people's conversations (or more generally, interactions).
                 Practically, these results suggest that group members (especially group leaders) might improve their
         micro-creativity by encouraging one another to express their ideas, justify them, and evaluate them carefully and
         politely. To aid free expression of ideas (including wrong ones), group leaders can create a safe and supportive
         group culture. Within this supportive culture, group leaders can elicit justifications and slow contemplation to
         aid correct evaluations and reduce impulsive, rude disagreements. Through these theoretical, methodological,
         and practical contributions, this study might help group members improve their micro-creativity.
