                   Abstract: Friendship and peer acceptance contribute uniquely to positive social and emotional
                   adjustment whereas low status within the peer group has been found to produce rejection,
                   loneliness and harassment. We have studied how the exclusionary ties and friendship ties are
                   distributed among first grade pupils in the classroom. The basic question was whether girls'
                   and boys' networks are different from each other in regards to the density and centrality of the
                   ties. Further, the size of the class and the effect of the level of multicultural heterogeneity to
                   the tie distribution were   studied. All  analyses were  made    at class  level. Surprisingly,  no
                   remarkable differences were found. The size of the class was found as an important factor
                   influencing on the amount of exclusionary ties. The multicultural heterogeneity did not either
                   have big influence on the composition of different types of social ties. The sample is large
                   (738 children, 50    school classes)  and therefore, the  results can   be generalized  to  similar
                   cultural environments.

        Introduction
                   Children's social status and social relations with peers and friends as a part of their social competence
         have received much attention in recent research literature (e.g., Ladd, 1999; Hartup & Abecassis, 2004). In these
         studies, the importance of remarkable developmental effects of peer relations and friendships on children's life
         has  been highlighted.  Friendship    and peer  acceptance   contribute uniquely  to  positive social and   emotional
         adjustment whereas low status within the peer group has been found to produce maladaptive properties of poor
         peer  relations,  rejection, loneliness and  harassment.    Peers  and  friends  have   important role in   children's
         developmental process. Friendship represents strong, affective, equal, mutual tie, or commitment between two
         children. Participation  and   belonging    to peer  group   enriches  children's social,   emotional  and  academic
         competence (Bagwell, 2004).
                   According to several studies, negative outcomes are often observed for children left outside the peer
         groups   (Hymel,  Vaillancourt,  McDougall     &  Renshaw,   2004).   Children's  close relationships  can  have two
         different sides, bright and dark. According to Hartup and Abecassis (2004) most relationships have dark sides
         and  the  developmental  impact   is  determined  by the manner    in which   darker  side  elements  intertwine with
         brighter  elements.  They    suggest that negative  relationships are also  developmentally    significant at least by
         middle childhood (Hartup & Abecassis, 1998, 2004).
                   Gender and children's peer relations are closely related (Underwood, 2004).       Children prefer to interact
         with peers of their own gender from the third year of life (Serbin, Moller, Gulko, Powlishta & Colbourne, 1994).
         Consequently, the Two Cultures Theory proposes that boys and girls mostly interact in same-gender groups,
         which differ on many important dimensions (Maccoby, 1990). Among preschoolers opposite-sex friendships
         occur in  relatively small   numbers.   The lack of  gender  attention  among   peer-relation-researchers  has  led to
         mixed evidence for gender differences in peer relations (Underwood, 2004).
                   Theories concerning girls' and boys' social networks differ from each other. It has been claimed that
         boys' networks are larger and more hierarchically organized whereas girls' networks are described as smaller
         and more horizontal in structure (Daniel-Bierness, 1989; Maccoby, 1998). Peer relations research argues that
         girls' and boys' networks are of equal size (see Cairns & Cairns, 1994). Also, peer cliques have been found to
         not differ in size and both genders are equally likely to be central members of their respective cliques (Bagwell,
         Coie, Terry & Lochman, 2000). Regarding to peer status across many different studies children nominate more
         same-gender peers for more positive items and more other-gender peers for negative items (Daniel-Bierness,
         1989). Recently, more advanced sociometric tests have become an influential method of studying social status
         and peer relations.
                   Cultural differences among children's background can have remarkable effect on peer relations and
         friendships. There is lot of evidence based on research that cross-race friendships appear to be less numerous
         than same-race ones for both black and white students (e.g., Boulton & Smith, 1996; Clark & Ayers, 1988;

2-
Graham & Cohen, 1997; Howes & Wu, 1990; Dubois, 1990.) However, research focusing on children' s within-
school friendships has pointed out that children attending integrated elementary schools are likely to develop
friendships  with children  from  other   racial  groups  (Fletcher, Rollins  &    Nickerson,   2004).  Clark and Ayers
(1988) argue that children typically form friendships with other children who are located in close proximity to
themselves, such as in their classrooms at school. However, there are differences between races in this respect
and nature of these differences varies across studies (e.g. Hallinan & Williams, 1987; Hallinan & Smith, 1985;
Graham & Cohen, 1997; Hallinan & Teixeira, 1987).
         Aboud and her colleagues (2003) drew a conclusion that racial prejudice relates most strongly to the
number   of  excluded  classmates.   Children     tend to have   more   same-   than  cross-race  companions.     Further,
although racial attitude was not a factor in friend selection, selectivity on the basis of race was evident at both
companion and friend levels, but more common at the companion level where grade, gender and participant's
race had no moderating effects. Children with higher levels of prejudice were more likely than their tolerant
classmates to exclude cross-race classmates, but not less likely to be friends with them (Aboud, Mendelson &
Purdy,  2003).  When  examining      students' same-ethnicity   preferences   in   peer nominations    Bellmore  with  her
research group   found   that students made    more    nominations   to same-ethnicity    peers when    there were  larger
numbers of same-ethnicity peers in the classroom. In addition, students who gave more acceptance nominations
to same-ethnicity   peers were    more   accepted  among    same-ethnicity     peers  and  less accepted   among    other-
ethnicity peers (Bellmore, Nishina, Witkow, Graham & Juvonen, 2007).

Research problems
         We aim to study how the exclusionary ties and friendship ties are distributed among first graders. We
examine whether girls' and boys' networks are different from each other regarding the density and centralization
of the ties and whether multicultural background or class size has an influence on the social structure among
children. The analyzing unit is at class level. Research problems for the study can be stated in the following
way:
    1.   What is the density of exclusionary ties, positive ties, and friendship ties in the classroom? How much
         are the  social ties centralized  in  the classroom?    Are  there   differences between    classes? If there  are
         differences, how these can be explained? Is the size of the class having influence on the density or
         centralization of the exclusionary ties or friendship ties?
    2.   How are the friendship ties and exclusionary ties distributed inside and between gender groups? Are
         there differences in cohesion in equally distributed, male dominated or female dominated classes? If
         the social  structure is different   in  boys' and girls'   group,   this should be   seen  as comparing   male-
         dominant classes with female-dominant classes.
    3.   How multicultural heterogeneity influences on friendship ties and exclusionary ties in the classroom?
         Are there more exclusionary ties among pupils coming from different cultural environments? Is the
         social structure of multicultural classes different from culturally homogeneous classes?

Method
Participants
         The study is part of Origins of Exclusion Project, which is a Finnish longitudinal study of children's
risk of social and academic exclusion in childhood. In this sub study, there are 738 participants of 7- to 8- year-
old children from 50 classes at 35 public schools on the western coast of Finland (population 175, 354). In
Finland, the school is generally started at the age of seven years and all participants are first graders. Parental
consent to take part in the study was received for 354 girls and 384 boys. This is about 80% of all children of the
target group.   Most participants    have Finnish  origin,  only  10  percent   of  the  pupils have   some   other ethnic
background. For the study, the multicultural heterogeneity has been defined based on the home language of the
children. Three variables have been built: 1) the amount of home languages spoken in the classroom (Finnish
and Swedish are calculated as different languages even if they both are official languages in Finland) and 2) the
amount of children speaking a language other than Finnish or Swedish in the class. Further, 3) the grouping
variable at class level has been built in which all the classes consisting of only the children speaking Finnish or
Swedish with at maximum one child speaking some other language as their home language, have been classified
as a homogenous class and all classes having at least two children speaking a language other than Finnish or
Swedish have been classified as multicultural classes.

Data gathering
         Sociometric   peer   rating has  been   used  to collect the   data. The   assessments   of peer relations    were
conducted   by  interviewing   children.  All  of the  children  were   interviewed   in  individual testing  sessions  by
trained female experimenters in the spring of their first school year. Each child was told to rate all of his or her
classmates according to how much he/she liked to play or be with the particular pupil. The choices were: `I
would  like  to play with  him/her   always'   (friendship tie),  `I would    sometimes   like to play  with  him   or her'

                                                                                                                              2-
         (positive  tie) or `I would  not at all  like   to play with  him/her' (exclusionary   tie). All measurements    were
         administered    by using the group  photograph      of each school  class. The  photographs   were    used in order to
         overcome any memory problems that might occur by relying on names only (cf. Asher, Singleton, Tinsley, &
         Hymel,   1979;   Howes,  1987; Maassen,      Steenbeek,  &  van Geert, 2004.)   Interviews   lasted  approximately  30
         minutes, and subjects were assured of the confidentiality of their responses to all research questions.

        Analysis and SNA measures
                   For social network analysis (SNA), the peer evaluations gathered by interviews were organised in the
         case by case matrix for all 50 classes, in which the columns and rows were organised in equal order, covering
         the friendship networks of all 738 children. The square matrices (N=50) contain the information as self report
         (in rows) and peer reports (in columns).
                   In SNA, density and centrality are basic concepts.
         Density. Density shows how many ties exist in the network compared to the maximum number of possible ties.
         The density measure is used to analyse the cohesiveness and interaction within classes.
         Centralization: While density describes the general level of cohesion, centralization refers to a different aspect
         of the  overall  compactness  of   the graph.   Centralization  describes  the extent to which   the   connections  are
         organized around particular actors. Freeman's indegree and outdegree measures are calculated. Indegree value
         indicates how many times a child has been rated (e.g. as a friend) by his or her classmates, while outdegree is
         the number the ties (e.g. friends) she or he has reported her/himself.

        Results
                   The sizes of the classes participating in the study are reasonable small as the first grade children are the
         target group for the study. The children who were not allowed to take part in the studies are not reported in the
         numbers presented here (see Table 1). The share of these children is low, only 2-4 children in each class. As
         being absent is related to their parent's general request not to let their children take part in studies, and not
         opposing on this study as such and as the share of these children is reasonably low, it is plausible that this does
         not cause any bias of the results.

                   We first present some descriptive statistic related to how the friendship ties and exclusionary ties are
         distributed at classroom level. Density values indicate how many ties there are compared to maximal number of
         the possible ties. As the children belong to the same class community, it is taken for granted that there always is
         a tie (exclusive, positive or friendship tie) between two children in the same class. We begin by presenting
         results in which   the exclusionary    ties are distinguished  from positive   and friendship  ties. In some  analysis
         positive ties and friendship ties are added together. As there always is a tie between each children pair (dyad)
         and as the density values are calculated for dichotomic matrices, the sum of the density values of exclusionary
         ties, positive ties and friendship ties is 1 for each class. The centralization values can be though of as percents,
         which   show    how much  the  ties are  focused    around  the most central   pupil. The  statistics  for density and
         centrality values of the ties are presented in Table 2.

        The results show that the mean value for exclusionary tie density in the classroom is 0,33, i.e. that
every third tie is exclusionary. The share of the friendship ties is on average 0,27. There are some differences
among classes. It is plausible to expect that most exclusionary ties are reported between gender, and the most
neutral and strong positive ties are inside gender.
        We first examine how the size of the class influences the density and distribution of the social ties.
Pearson's measure     indicates negative   correlation between  the size   of the  class   and density  of  the mutual
friendship ties (r=-0,292; p<0.05) and friendship ties (r=-0,349; p<0.05).      So, the share of friendship ties and
mutual friendship ties is smaller in big classes than in small classes (see Table 3).

        *p<0.05

        Further, the size of the class is having influence on the way the observed ties are distributed among
children. The negative correlation is high especially as regarding the friendship out-degree values (r=-0.465;
p<0.01), i.e. in big classes reporting about friendship is more equally found among children compared to the
small classes   in which some     children report more  friendship  ties than  other  do.  However,    peer evaluation
measures (in-degree values) regarding friendship or positive ties do not vary much along the size of the class.
Regarding exclusionary ties, the size of the class is having the most effect on the centralization of the ties. There
is rather high negative correlation both for out-degree values (r=-0,291; p<0.05) and in-degree values (r=-0,409;
p<0.01). Thus, the results show that in smaller classes some students report more, and especially receive more,
exclusionary ratings from their peers compared to other in the same class whereas in bigger classes these are
more  equally   distributed. To   conclude, even  if   the amount of   exclusionary   ties is  less in smaller  classes

                                                                                                                           2-
         compared to big classes, these are more focused on some children and reported more often by some pupils (see

                   Regarding    gender  distribution, no statistically significant correlation  can be   found   between    the
         densities of  social  ties and  the share  of  males (females)   in the  classroom.  Moreover,   there  is only    one
         centralization value indicating any correlation with the share of males (females) in the classroom. The share of
         males (females) in the classroom is somewhat correlating with exclusionary outdegree values indicating that in
         the male dominated classes the exclusionary ties are more equally distributed than in the classes having the
         female  dominance.    The  Pearson's  correlation (r=-0,265)   found is,  however,  not statistically significant. To
         conclude, on the contrary to expectations based on previous research, no differences are found depending on
         whether the class is having a girl majority, or a boy majority.

            Therefore, we continue the analysis by dividing the classes into female majority classes (boys less
than 35% of all children, N=6), equally distributed classes (boys from 35-65% of all children, N=35), and male
dominated classes (boys more than 65% of the children, N=9). In the following table (see Table 5), we compare
these groups of classes with each other to see how much there are mutual exclusionary ties, exclusionary ties,
positive ties, friendship ties, and mutual friendship ties and how these are centralized among children.
          The  results indicate  that there are  some   differences that   are statistically significant. In   the female
dominant classes, there are less exclusionary ties than in the equally distributed or the male dominant classes.
However, these ties are more centralized to certain children. According to the results, the mutual positive ties
are as common in each class groups and equally centralized, which was not expected. The main differences
seem to be in exclusionary ties. In female dominated classes, excluding is focused more on some children but
these nominations are only little reported, i.e. there are less exclusionary ties than in those classes having more
boys. Consequently     boys  report more    exclusionary  ties than the   girls. The  result  is consistent  with  earlier
research.
          We now go on to study in which way cultural heterogeneity in the classroom influences social ties. No
correlation  can  be   found at  class level density    and centrality  values   with  any   social network    density  or
centralization  measure  (mutual  exclusionary    ties, exclusionary   ties, positive  ties, friendship  ties, or  mutual
friendship  ties) and  variables built for  cultural diversity (number    of home   languages    spoken   in the  class or
number of children in the class speaking other than official Finnish languages). Therefore, we continue analysis
by dividing the classes into culturally heterogeneous classes (with more than one child in the class speaking a
home language other than Finnish or Swedish) and other classes. The results of the analysis are presented in
Table 6.

          The  results indicate  that  only two  statistically significant   differences can  be  found   between   these
groups of classes. The density (amount) of the friendship ties or exclusive ties does not differ in a statistically
significant way   when  comparing     culturally diversified   classes to the  classes with   only  Finnish  or  Swedish

                                                                                                                              2-
         speaking children. However, the distribution of mutual friendship ties and how friendship ties are reported (out
         degree values  for  both asymmetric    and   mutual friendship ties) differ  in the classrooms.   This  means   that in
         culturally heterogeneous classes some children have more friendship ties and some have less, and this difference
         is bigger on average than in the classes consisting only of one cultural group. When interpreting the results we
         have to remember that the share of cultural diversity is rather small in Finland and that in the environment in
         which there are more children coming from different cultural backgrounds the effect might be stronger. It would
         also be important to study how gender and multicultural aspects have co-variance.

        Conclusions
                   To sum up the results, we can see that there are less exclusionary ties in female dominant classes than
         in male dominant or equally gender distributed classes. These ties are more centralized toward some children in
         the classes where there are less exclusionary ties. Further, we have to remember that the results only refer to the
         social structure at class level, not with the content of the activities or relationships as such. The next step in our
         study is now to go on to level of individual pupils, and to examine e.g. the size of boys' and girls' egocentric
         networks in the classroom. More detailed analyses are needed to get a better understanding of the relationship of
         friendship ties and exclusionary ties among children's gender group.
                   Due to large sample we can observe some differences among classes. On the basis of the first results it
         is plausible   to expect  that   cultural homogeneity    could   cause differences   among     classes. In   culturally
         homogenous classes ties are distributing in different way than in culturally heterogeneously classes.
                   To conclude,   it  seems   that  the social  structure among   first  graders is    varying   at class level
         measurements but the explanations for this are not known. The data set of the study is strong enough to enable
         some  generalization   regarding  the  results presented  in the  paper, at  least  within culturally   similar school
         environments. The contribution of our research is, therefore, to bring a large peer reported study to the area
         which very often has been based only on rather tiny number of participants, and looking at the phenomena at a
         level of individual children.
