A fundamental requirement of collaborative learning isthat a common environment of shared recognition andex-perience is established (c. f. e. g.Schrage, 1990).Such a community is not created by simply a processof information transmission and distribution (Schrage,1990, Lave and Wenger, 1991) or assimilation (Piaget,1950,Illeris,1974),butinaprocessinwhichthestudents have a certain degree of obligation to eachother. The students may have different interests, holdvarious viewpoints and meanings, and make diversecontributionstotheactions.However,theparticipating students need to have a shared understanding concerning what they are doing and what thatmeans for their individual development process and forthe development of the learning community which theyare a part of (c.f. Lave and Wenger, 1991).The primary target group for most distance- andopen learning situations, is the adult work force of oursociety. The student-the adult worker, usually with anestablishedlifewithfamilyandfriends-needsaflexible (further) educational situation free from place-,and often time, constraints.

Dialogues takeplacewithananalogytotheprocessofwriting,sending and receiving a letter (Sorensen, 1991). Thus,the dynamic and spontaneous nature characterising adialogueisfundamentallyonthepremisesofthewritten language. The dialogue lacks the expressivepower and interpretative cues resulting from the loss ofvisualinformationandfeedbackopportunities(Eklundh, 1986). In distance learning situations, thewritten and asynchronous dialogue is the dominatingaspect of cooperation, because the students to a largedegree do not have any other possibilities to cooperate.The students report that in a collaborative learningprocess-based on problem oriented project pedagogy(see next chapter)-it is extremely time consuming anda factor of frustration to carry out inter-human actionsdirected towards consensus seeking and inter-humanconflicts in general, but especially in the fundamentalproblem formulation phase and in the articulations ofeachother'scontributionstotheproject(LpthandKphler,1995,c.f.e.g.Georgsen,1995,DirckinckHolmfeld and Fjuk, 1995).
