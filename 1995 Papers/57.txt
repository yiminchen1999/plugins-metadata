1. IntroductionCollaboration as a goal of learning goes together withother learning goals such as integration of theory andpractice and coping with uncertainty and change. AsteachersattheOpenUniversityfortenyears,theauthors have experienced collaboration as a learninggoal among the students. Most distance students areemployed,studyingparttime.Quiteoftentheymaketheir employer pay their fee. Employers do this becausetheywanttoexpandtheorganisation'spotentialfor"organisationallearning",whilethestudentstlremselves want to expand their current professional competence. The wish to obtain collaborative skills is oneinstancewheregoalsoftheemployersandtheemployees come together."Organisational learning" is aconcept put forward and given meaning by Argyris [1]and Schon [9]. Inspired by Bateson they emphasise theimportance of generating double-loop learning throughthe questioning of assumptions. The skills required toengage in double-loop learning are skills that in a widerperspective enable humans to cope with uncertaintyand take action in a multicultural and multivoiced andever changing environment. Collaborative skills do notonly make people responsive to, but more likely innovators of change, based on what Schon [9] has calledreflection-in-action.Suchskillsdonotnecessarilycome along with academic training. However, theseThe project and problem oriented study form wasimplementedatAalborgUniversityastheoverallpedagogic strategy twenty years ago as a response toexperiental learning, the radical trend in pedagogy inEurope in those days. Today, itis no longer an experiment but forms a solid foundation for the universitystudies at Aalborg University, despite the fact that experiential learning is no longer the dominating pedagogical fashion, The project organised and problemoriented study form has proved its effectiveness as wellas its efficiency on strictly economic and qualitativeterms.For the last ten years the project and problem orientationhasproveditsrelevancealsointheOpenlearning activities carried out in Aalborg. Most of thestudents at Open University want to improve or changecareer and enhance their ability for reflection-in-action,buildingontheirprofessionalexperience.Forthesestudents the project organised and problem orientedstudy form offers a great opportunity, but also, especially with respect to time and location constraints, achallenge and some problems.

While in the theory of organisational learning, collaborative skills are seen as important to obtain, they in thepedagogicaltheoriesbehindprojectpedagogyarerather taken as a precondition:The theory of experiential learning views learningas a social construction process. The German Marxinspired critical pedagogical philosopher Oscar Negt[6] has suggested that the university may be viewed asan "emancipatoric room". Through critical (and ideology-critical) studies combining personal experienceswith theory through the collaboration between teachersand students the traditional scientific paradigm is transcended and alternative scientific paradigms emerging.Onthepersonallevel,thelearnergetthechanceofviewing her/his professional practice in the light ofdifferent scientific paradigms.Thetheoryof"situatedlearning"formulatedbyLave and Wenger [4] takes apprenticeship learning asthe archetypal instance of learning, and suggests thatcollaboration understood as legitimate peripheral participation in a practice is the most fruitful wayoflearning. Through participation the students informallyand successively learn to deal with practice, to acquirethe university culture and discourse.At the beginning of each semester the students arebuilding teams in a problem formulation process drivenby personal experience and/or curiosity.As they striveto investigate their problem, they - through the discussions with their supervisor - are faced with the scientifically theoretical and methodological demands thatconstitutes their discipline, as well as with the diversityof opinions and world views represented in the group.Since they are working on the same project and arefaced with an examination of the project at the end ofsemester, the frustrations and break downs in understanding produced under these circumstances mostlyturn out to be productive to the individual learningprocess as well as to the quality of the outcome, theproject report.Throughtheirdiscussionthestudentsdevelopskills to formulate a valid argument and judge its potential falsification, just like if they were students all ontheir own. Since they have to do it in a peer group, theyat the same time are forced to take the argument furtherthan they would dare to and be able to, being on theirown.The need of shared understanding stimulates thestudent's social imagination and enforces them to go
