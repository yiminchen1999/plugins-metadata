1.  Perspectives        and   TheoreticalFrameworkPsychologists have been explaining the risk shiftphenomenon with several hypotheses."Diffusion ofresponsibility" theory explains risky shift in terms ofgroup members' feelings that in the case of failure,the entire group, rather than the individuals, will beblamed."Value" theory contends that risk-taking isregarded as a valuable characteristic in American society; thatgroup members tend to manifest a riskyopinionaspartoftheirculturalconditioning."Familiarization" theory suggests that in a group,members have an opportunity to obtain more information about tasks, situation, and strategies, so theybecome bold in decision-making.Guided by psychological theories and research,academic risk-taking has been demonstrated as ameans to enhance students' learning and motivation.It has been postulated and demonstrated that moderaterisk-taking maximizes satisfaction (Atkinson, 1957),enhances self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977, 1986), elicitsconstructive attributions (Meyer, Folkes, & Weiner,1976),providesvaluedcompetenceinformationcontext of risk-taking, that is, whether the risks aretaken individually or collaboratively.Based on research of risky shift (Harrell, 1991; Knowles, 1976;Turner & Cashdan, 1988; Wallach, Kogan, & Bern,1964), it can be predicted that students will takehigher risks in a collaborative risk-taking situationthan in an individual risk-taking situation.This collaborative learning situation can be easily created andsupported by using a computer as a learning tool.General findings concerning the effectiveness ofCSCLhavebeenwidelypublished.WhileKing(1989)foundnosignificantrelationshipbetweengroup ability level and success in a study of fourthgraders engaged in computer-assisted problem solving, she did identify different patterns of verbal interactions between groups who were successful or unsuccessfulinsolvingtheproblems.HooperandHannafin (1988) formed homogeneous or heterogeneous groups of low- and high-ability eighth gradestudents to complete a computer-assisted mathematicstutorial.Low-abilitystudentsinheterogeneousgroups consistently outscored low-ability students inhomogeneous groups.In a similar study with highand average-ability fifth and sixth grade students, re-

a good tool to provide a CSCL environment for research where we can measure whether students willtake higher risks in a cooperative situation or in anindividual situation in order to solve problems.In the present study, variables of modeling andsocial context were manipulated to examine the effects of these variables on students' risk-taking andthe proposed explanations for risky shift in a CSCLenvironment using a drill and practice type of computer program.only significant effect found was the main effect ofgrade, F (1,133) = 6.56, p < .01, indicating thirdgrade students selected problems resulting in loweraccuracy than did the fourth grade students (meanswere 40 and 50, respectively)Supporting the theories of "diffusion of responsibility" and "familiarization", subjects in the collaborative context felt less responsible for the risks theytook (M=3.18), F(l,124) = 4.00. p < .045, and obtained more information relevant to problem-solving

HyperCard for Macintosh computers and (2) a questionnaire to assess students' feelings in the collaborative and individual risk-taking situations.Studentsselectedtheirowndifficultyleveltosolve the problem in the ART program until theymade 10 selections.Students' selections and performances were recorded by the computer to yield twodependent variables-difficulty and accuracy.TheART program also manipulated the modeling variable.A short story about a student's attitude towardrisk-taking in academic situation was shown on thescreen only to the students in the modeling condition.Subjects were randomly assigned to the modeling andnon-modeling conditions.The variable of collaborative context was manipulated as a within-subject variable.In the collaborative situation, the subjects wereinstructed to work on the problems collaborativelyand to reach the agreement on the answers before entering them.After the completion of the ART ineach session, the questionnaire was administered. Thequestionnaire contained 12 statements on a 6-pointLikert scale.The instrument yielded three scores:perceived responsibility, value of risk-taking, and familiarization of problem-solving. Data were collectedin two sessions with a one week interval between thesessions.Differing from previous research on risky shift whereresearchers focused on unhealthy behaviors such asshoplifting or gambling, this study applied the principle of risky shift in a constructive way to encouragestudents to select challenging tasks in their academicactivities.Furthermore, this study provided explanations for risky shift in computer supported learningenvironment.Students in a computer supportedcollaborative risk-taking context tend to take higher risksbecause they feel less threatened by the consequencesof failure, a finding consistent with research showingthat students take high risks when external constraintsare reduced. Also, students in the computer supportedcollaborative context took higher risks because theyfelt they gained information from each other by working as a collaborative learning group, a finding consistent with that in economics research that informationreducingambiguityincreasesrisk-taking(Ellsberg, 1961).Practically, this study shows an advantage ofCSCL that has not been reported in previous research.Research has shown that collaborative learning is aneffective method of increasing student achievement invarious subjects and improve attitudes toward classmates and themselves (Sharan, 1980; Slavin, 1990;
