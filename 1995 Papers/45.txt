1. IntroductionStudiesincollaborativelearning(O'Malley,1995)stress the need to " focus more on the processes involved in successful peer interaction, rather than juston learning outcomes ". With the functionalities afforded by new networked technologies, there is nowthe potential for students to share their learning experiences with each other and also interact more dynamically with their tutors. Although asynchronous computer supported collaboration has been a frequent research interest (Harasim, 1990), on-line synchronouswork is an issue that has received very little attentionin the area of CSCL. Because synchronous interactionsare an essential part of academic training (Cf academiclearning as second order experience of the world, Laurillard, 1993), we chose here to focus on synchronoustools, allowing for immediate active interaction andfeedback between learners.Weare,therefore,particularlyinterestedinwhether technology-mediated synchronous communication and collaboration between students and tutorscan facilitate the process of learning to learn. To thisend, we consider the interface between networked colearners to be a central issue. Our work focuses on de-thismeanstakingintoaccountthecharacteristicsproper to a situated, psychological, social incarnatedactor in studying his specific learning activity.
