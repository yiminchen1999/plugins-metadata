The availabilityoflow-cost,high-performancegraphicworkstationsand personal computers has made it possible to supportvisual thinking processes in a variety of ways across awide range of disciplines, and again has led to a majorliterature on visualization [2]. There is also a large andgrowing literature on the use of computer-based toolsto support visual languages for a wide variety of structures [3].The activities reported in this article are part of along-term program of research on the technology andA wide variety of different forms of concept maphave been applied in education [6]. In management,Axelrod proposed cognitive maps as a means of representing the conceptual structures underlying decisionmaking [7]. In the history of science, the dynamics ofconceptmapshavebeenusedtorepresenttheprocesses of conceptual change in scientific revolutions[8, 9]. In the philosophy of science, Toulmin [10] developed a theory of scientific argument based on typedconcept maps.

Applications to Collaborative LearningWe have previously reported experience in the use ofconcept maps to support creative processes in collaborative learning situations [11]. Our approach has beento have individual students develop concept maps fortheir domain of interest and link them to associatedmaterials. Other students then critique these maps,modifying them, or adding to them, to provide alternative versions.Sometimesconsensualmapsaredevelopedbynegotiation.Atothertimestheabsenceofsuchconsensus is the major learning experience since it
