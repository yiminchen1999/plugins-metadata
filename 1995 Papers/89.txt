Complex and rapid changes in society requires personaldevelopment, flexible knowledge, higher-order skills,social commitment and permanent professional education. This requires from learners an active knowledgeconstruction instead of a solitaire information process-subjectivistic character of knowledge construction as aresult of students' individual knowledge and strategicexperiences and their interpretations of the world aroundthem. Also is emphasised that the acquisition of rigidfactual knowledge is of less use when one never learns
