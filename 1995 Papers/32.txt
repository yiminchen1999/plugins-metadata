3.2. The Color Matcher
The Color Matcher is the CSCL application that we
developed first.  This activity was designed to promote
learning and discussion about the RGB additive system
used by most monitors for displaying color [7]. It won

multiple input technology.
    The Color Matcher activity gives each of three
players access to his or her own mouse which corre
sponds to a red, green or blue colored cursor on the
screen.  The goal is for the players to match a target
color generated by the computer.
    Figure 1 shows the Color Matcher user interface.
The interface contains two color frames, the left is the
target color and the one on the right is the users' color
frame.  The users' color is determined by combining
the RGB values controlled by three horizontal scroll
bars.  The color values, which range from 0-255 de
pending on the position of the slider, are shown above
the scroll bars.  A scroll bar can be modified only by
the cursor of the same color.
    Although each user is only in control of his or her
own color, the users are collaborating to reach the sin
gle goal of matching one color.   In order to succeed at
this activity, users must, at a minimum, communicate
about the relative amounts of color needed.   Users also     rectly  match  the chord, although  they may   check

as determined by the position of the scroll bar, and
max_distance is the maximum distance possible in the
color space.    The entire activity consists of matching
ten colors. All scores are recorded in a ASCII log file.

3.3. The Chord Matcher
The Chord Matcher application is very similar to the
Color Matcher, except that the users are charged with
matching musical chords rather than RGB colors.      The
chords  vary    from a relatively easy major  chord,  to
more difficult selections of three random notes of a 5-
octave chromatic scale.   Each user selects his or her
note from the five octave range using a color coded
scroll bar.  As with the Color Matcher, users can only
operate scroll bars of the same color as their mouse
cursor.
    Each user may hear his or her own note at will by
clicking on a button.  Similarly any user may audition
the current team chord, or the target chord.  Any user
may also request a hint, up to a maximum of ten hints
per session. The users  are   given 120 seconds to cor-

3.4. The Curve Fitter
The Curve Fitter activity is designed to allow students
to explore how changing the location of control points
modifies the shape of a polynomial curve.       The user
interface for the Curve Fitter is shown in Figure 3.
This activity is designed for two to four users.
     As  with    the   Color  Matcher    and  the Chord
Matcher, each player controls a mouse which corre
sponds to a colored cursor on the screen.     Each cursor
can move a correspondingly colored control point on
an image to modify the shape of the curve.      The goal
of the  activity is  to   match  a degree  1 to degree 5
polynomial  with     a  curve  in  the image   under  120
seconds.    The   users      choose  the  degree  of  the
polynomial before starting the activity.      The scores
range  from O to  100     and is based  on how  close the
curve is to the shape of the image.      A high score is
given for a close fit to the curve, thus a score of 100
represents the best fit of the curve.
     Again the users need to communicate about the
task they are performing.     They typically discuss the
shape of curve in relation to the locations of each of
the control points.    The only shared resource in this
game is the button to check their answer.

                                                                on the screen.   When there are three users engaged in
