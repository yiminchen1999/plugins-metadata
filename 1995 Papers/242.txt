     During the above interaction, both students appearto employ dynamic mental imagery (see [3, 5]), evidenced by hand motions, reports of self-projection, andthe report of multiple states of the scenario.We hypothesize that such mental imagery during the treatment may assist students in visualization of relativemotion problems when the computer simulation is absent (see [9] for a similar result).model of a relative motion problem through parallelconstruction of a visual model (see [15]) and a numericmodel.The generation of the visual modelis done byconstructing a visual model of the motion of objects,relative to each medium which motion occurs in or on,and coordinating the components.(see [5] for a similar hypothesis.) In parallel with visual model construction, the student may construct a numeric model ofcomponents of the problem and combine the numeric
