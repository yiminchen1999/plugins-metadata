      The paper presents some highlights from an example of this kind of hermeneutic analysis. The development of the interaction between two children playing anew game intended to promote a conception of "thesystem of numbers as a whole-to-parts system"'illustrates how children may provide each other with learning experiences even in the midst of misunderstanding.2.Conceptual Change and CollaborationConceptual change, in our view, is a phenomenon always taking place within the zone of proximal development [9], a zone of capacity for enhanced performance under adult guidance or in collaboration withpeers.

It is evident from her nextmove, that here the landscape from her perspective hasat last changed into a problem of the current part of thewhole journey.She watches as Kevin selects "5." This successfully brings the Rabbit from "stone 8" to "stone 13,"expected by the explaining party to be obvious to theother child, who on the contrary manages to incorporate the explanation with his or her present perspective.In both cases the "failing" child turns out to persistin his/her earlier preference, and in both cases the childwho is in a position to see the other as responsible for afailure then leaves rational explanation and resorts tothe persuasive force of her/his conviction as expressedin a repeated and emphatic offer of her/his own preferred choice - Lisa's happening to be based on amistaken assumption and Kevin's on a correct one.In both cases the child positioned as responsiblefor the latest failure then acts upon the strongly expressed advice of the other child.
