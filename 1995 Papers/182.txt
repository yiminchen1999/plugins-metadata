   Mental Models.     Mental models are the conceptions of a system that develop in the mind of theuser. Mental models possess representations of objects or events in systems and the structural relationships between those objects and events.Mental models evolve inductively as the user interactswith the system, often resulting in analogical, incomplete, or even fragmentary representations ofhowthesystemworks(Farooq&Dominick,1988).Unlike cognitive and conceptual modelsthat describe how users should represent a domainor system, mental models describe how users orlearners actually conceive of the system or domain.Moran (1981) expresses the belief of many designers that the design of the system controls the men-for describing mental model development is analogicalor metaphorical reasoning (Staggers & Norcio, 1993).Thatis,learnersgeneralizeexistingmodelstonewphenomena through a process known as structure-mapping, that is, mapping the old structural relations ontonew (Gentner & Gentner, 1983).For example, flowingwater helps most people develop a mental model forelectricity.Most theories believe that mental modelsconsist of objects and their relationships (Gentner &Gentner, 1983; Carley & Palmquist, 1992).The objects are concepts or nodes, and the relationships arelinks or verbs that state the nature of the relationshipsbetween objects.The node-link combinations are combined into networks or maps of relationships that describe the domain of knowledge represented by a mental
