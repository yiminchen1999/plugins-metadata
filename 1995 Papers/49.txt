    If the grade is fair, there will be 25% possibility
         that the solution is correct and the responding
         time is longer than when the grade is good.
         The other 75% possibility is to respond with
        incorrect code chunk or ask for help.

    If the grade is poor, the response is either showing
         incorrect code chunk or asking for help.

    Given the limited number of subjects per system,the result of these preliminary trials are not significantand can only provide us a picture of how to drawhypotheses about reciprocal tutoring.All PLS studentslike the system and think that they can focus betterwithout caring about the syntax and it is convenient tohave other facilities, such as checking the solution withexamples.The low performance of PLS is apparentlyduetothefactthatmanyPLSstudentscouldnotproceed to other problems within two hours once theyhad trouble with one or two of the problems, becauseof the lacking of the hints and the needed feedback.Moreover,studentsusingothersystemsmaylearnmore from the hints provided.About the sub-task nature of tutoring and tuteeing,there are some significant differences in the posttest results.Low performance of HTS is expected sincestudents only need to watch the computer tutee, expandthe DT when needed, and choose a hint for the student,thus is less intellectually demanding than tuteeing.Inourinterviews,moststudentssaidthattheyliketutoring the computer because it is an easy task andthey agree that they should have learnt more if theyhad to do the problems themselves.Five out of sixHTSstudentspreferteachingcomputertoarealstudent because it is easier. CTS students like havinghints and some of them think that there are not enoughhints.Unlike other systems, all RTS students felt thatreciprocal tutoring is like playing a game.Now, ifCTS represents a typical ITS, then the performance ofRTSisaboutthesameasanITS.One possibleexplanation for this is that in reciprocal tutoring, whenmachines with a dyad taking turns to play the roles oftutor and tutee.Another one is a twofold reciprocaltutoringsystem.Itconsistsofthreeconnectedmachines with a triad participating three different subtasks. Detailed description of these distributed systemsis beyond the scope of this paper.A very preliminaryempirical trial indicates that there is possibility that thedistributed systems may surpass the centralized systems.A reason for this perhaps is the interpersonalmotivationorpeerpressuregeneratedinthecooperativelearningprocess.Currently,wearemoving these systems to Internet where the artificiallearning companion is an option for the student tochoose as a partner to cooperate, especially when thereis no other student on-line.Our current implementation of the simulated tuteecan be improved in several aspects.For example, wecan employ Bayesian net to represent the tutee model,insteadofusingthecurrentsimpleconceptlist.Bayesiannetprovidesarepresentationofmorecomplex concepts and relationships and a mechanismof updating and making reference of the belief values.All the decomposed solutions can be represented moresystematically in a single hierarchy of strategies insolving Lisp recursions (Greer & McCalla, 1989).Toenhance the psychological plausibility of a virtuallearning companion, task-related motivation may bemodeled to reflect the tutee's feelings and attitude, forexample, confidence and effort.Also, it is technicallydesirable to adopt a single student model to simulateboth the tutor and the tutee.Tutoringrepresentsarangeofactions,fromsimply lecturing, evaluating and diagnosing the tutee's
