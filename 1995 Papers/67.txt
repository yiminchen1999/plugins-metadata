1. IntroductionThe use of the computer as a tool during cooperativegroup work has added some new dimensions to theproblemsofequityandstatusdifferences(Cohen,1986).First, most of the questions about small groupwork are no simpler with the computer than without,and second, the computer's particular characteristicsmake some problems even more thorny.For example,we wonder how can we be sure all students are participating in an activity.When all students had access to acommon set of manipulatives, we could at least lookfor hands-on behavior as a sign of participation.Withthe computer, we must sometimes depend on fleetingtalk and focus of gaze as signs that a particular studenthas engaged with the task at hand.When we look at agroup of students around a computer, it is hard to knowifthestudentinteractingmostdirectlywiththecomputer is also the student doing most of the thinkingand problem solving.Ifweassumethatthepersoninteractingmostdirectly with the computer is also doing the lion's shareoflearning,inequitableaccesstothecomputerLOGOprogrammingtask(Underwood&Jindal,1994).Cohen, in a meta-analysis of non-technologybased group work studies, claims that different rulesapply depending on whether the task is well-structuredor ill-structured(Cohen, 1994). Other research indicatesthat groups with the most ideal gender-structuring maystill run afoul of equity problems due to idiosyncraticfactors in group composition (Hoyles, Healy & Pozzi,1994).Thisstudyfoundthatinitialinterpersonalhostilityinagroupaffectedthewaythegrouporganized the work, which in tum affected the group'sproductivity and the roles each individual was able toplay in the product.Research such as that cited above may be able tohelp us to alleviate gender-related equity problems.However, such research has revealed the problem oforganizing groups to promote equitable access to bequitecomplex,callingfordifferentorganizationsdepending on a large variety of interpersonal and taskrelatedfactors.Thisleavesteachersinadifficultanalytical position when they actually try to set upgroups in their classroom, because they must try todecide which of these factors apply to their own situa-
