        Abstract:     This  study  explored the  effect  of different types   of goal  instructions  on
        students' on-line argumentation.    Goal instructions specify what students should try to
        achieve during on-line discussions.     General goals (to persuade or explore) were crossed
        with   specific goals  (to generate  reasons   or counterarguments/rebuttals)      in a  3  x  3
        randomized    design   using 240  undergraduates.     The instruction    to generate  as many
        reasons  as   possible resulted  in deeper   and  more   qualified arguments,    whereas    the
        "explore" goal had little effect. The persuade goal resulted in arguments that were more
        focused and adversarial.     These results have important implications for building richer
        on-line discussions.   In particular, instructions to generate as many reasons as possible
        can result in the exploration and integration of opposing sides of an issue, potentially
        enhancing psychological understanding and best promoting Mercer's (1996) notion of
        exploratory talk.

        Collaborative   argumentation     refers to  students working    together   to construct    and  critique
arguments (Veerman & Treasure-Jones, 1999).       It is similar to Mercer's notion of exploratory talk (1996),
which  involves  students   building  on  one   another's ideas,  but also  disagreeing    with  another   when
appropriate to more fully explore an issue.    Exploratory talk improves both group and individual problem
solving skills (Fernández, Wegerif, Mercer, & Rojas-Drummond, 2001).          Although Mercer developed the
idea of exploratory talk in the context of face-to-face discussions, with the advent of the Internet and on-
line learning, the idea  of exploratory   talk  has been  incorporated   into notions  of  computer-supported
collaborative argumentation, or CSCA (Veerman & Treasure-Jones, 1999).         On-line discussions that reflect
deep thinking about various sides of a topic or concept have been have been postulated to result in greater
learning and the development of critical thinking skills (Koschmann, 2003).

        For exploratory talk to occur in CSCA, however, students must be willing to disagree with one
another and take different points of view.   Unfortunately, researchers have documented the reluctance of
many students to disagree with one another during asynchronous discussions (Koschmann, 2003).                An
important question, therefore, is how to stimulate exploratory talk and better argumentation in on-line
environments.   Some    researchers  have explored   various  types   of complex    scaffolds to   help  students
generate arguments and counterarguments (Bell & Linn, 2000; Nussbaum, Hartley, Sinatra, Reynolds, &
Bendixen,  in  press; Sandoval,   2003).   Another   avenue   of research  involves    the use   of simple  goal
instructions.  Goal instructions refer to specifying--as part of a discussion question--what students are
expected to accomplish, for example, "persuade one another of your point of view," or "explore this issue
in-depth to increase your understanding of it."

Research on Goal Instructions
        Several researchers have examined the effect of goal instructions on students' argumentative
writing (Page-Voth & Graham, 1999; Nussbaum & Kardash, 2003), and have specifically compared the
effect of general   goals   (such  as  to   persuade)   with  more    specific   goals (such    as  to   generate
counterarguments and rebuttals, see Ferretti, MacArthur, & Dowdy, 1999).         Specific goals specify the type
of argumentation moves that students should engage in, and researchers have found that specific goals--
because they provide more guidance--are more effective than general goals (Ferretti et al., 1999).          In a
recent study, Nussbaum and Kardash, 2003, found that a specific goal to generate counterarguments and
rebuttals was effective in producing more of these argumentation elements.       On the other hand, a specific

                                                     380
goal to produce more reasons did not result in a statistically significant greater number of reasons, although
there was a trend in the hypothesized direction.  Nussbaum and Kardash postulated that the reason goal was
ineffective because it did not provide students with any strategy for generating reasons beyond those they
would normally think of.

         Another   finding,  somewhat  in  contrast with  other  researchers,   was that the  general   goal "to
persuade" did have an effect, but it was to make written essays less likely to explore opposing sides of an
issue.  This   effect presumably    occurred  because  students  believe   that  if they present    any sort   of
counterarguments, it would make their essays less persuasive (Santos & Santos, 1999).          Nussbaum and
Kardash (2003) concluded that overall, the specific goal to generate counterarguments was more useful
than the general goal to persuade.

The Computer-Supported Environment
         These findings were explored in the context of writing argumentative essays, but not in an on-line
discussion  environment.     For the purpose   of  stimulating  exploratory  talk,  however,  the   use of  goal
instructions could be easily extended to on-line discussions.   It is unclear, though, whether similar results
would   hold.  Both    contexts  involve  students  writing   arguments,   but  the arguments    in an  on-line
environment are dialectical in nature (Andriessen, Baker, & Suthers, 2003), meaning that students are
responding  to one  another's  contributions.  Because  a dialectical  situation presents students   with   other
people's ideas, these ideas may stimulate new or related ideas in students.    A "reasons goal" may therefore
be more effective in a dialectical situation because students are better able to think of a greater variety of
reasons than when they compose an argumentative essay only by themselves.           Likewise, a persuasion goal
may cue  students   to be  more  one-sided  in their thinking   (as in the  nondialectical   context),  but in a
dialectical context, students may still be exposed to different points of view because "persuasion" might cue
students to debate and therefore disagree.    Persuasion might, however, still not be as effective as other
types of goal instructions in stimulating exploratory talk because it may decrease collaboration.

         The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of different types of goal instructions (both
general and specific) on the nature of students' on-line argumentation.    In addition to the general goal, "to
persuade," a general goal "to explore" was also examined because this goal was more aligned to the
purpose of exploratory talk.    However, because general goals may be less effective than specific goals,
specific goals regarding the generation of reasons, counterarguments, and rebuttals (that is, refutation of
counterarguments) were also examined.      In regards to reasons, although students do often spontaneously
generate reasons   for their claims,  of interest  was whether   students  would    generate  deeper chains    of
reasoning by providing reasons (or supporting evidence) for other reasons, or by including a greater variety
of reasons in their arguments.

Analytic Framework for Argument
         In this   study, different type of   goal instructions  constituted   the  independent   variable,  the
complexity  of arguments    the  dependent variable.   Before  proceeding,   it is  necessary to  articulate the
analytic framework that was used to conceptualize argumentation.        Based on a review of contemporary
texts on the analysis of arguments (e.g., Inch & Warnick, 2002; van Eemeren, Grootendorst, & Henkemans,
2003), a conceptual framework for analyzing arguments was developed.          In this framework, an argument
consists of a series of claims that bear logical relations to one another. This relationship can be either one
of support (or being supported by), or opposition, as when one claim refutes another or makes the other
claim less likely.  Claims are made when individuals interact with one another in the process of engaging
in certain social activities, such as having a discussion, engaging in a negotiation, seeking information, etc.
(Walton, 1998).    Not all statements made during an exchange are considered argumentative claims; the
statements must bear a logical relationship to other claims.

         In this framework, an argument consists of an initial global claim and a number of subarguments.
An initial global claim is the major contention made by the first party to an argument (for example, the
position on the issue under discussion of the first person to speak or to post a electronic discussion note).
There are four types of subarguments:      (a) supporting, (b) opposing, (c) contingent, and (d) divergent.
Supporting subarguments make the global claim more likely to be true, opposing subarguments less likely.
Contingent subarguments may simultaneously consider both sides of an issue, for example by weighing

                                                     381
advantages against disadvantages, or by holding that the global claim may be true but only under certain
conditions.  A divergent subargument departs from the original line of discussion by providing support for
a major claim different (but not opposing to) the initial global claim.

          Claims can  be   classified along  two dimensions:    (a) type, and (b) level.   A   claim's type is
determined by the type of subargument it is part of, for example, the claims making up a supporting
subargument are considered supporting claims.      Likewise, claims making up an opposing subargument are
considered opposing claims.    (Note that some of the opposing claims support one another, but they are
globally considered opposing, not supporting, claims because they do not support the initial global claim.)
The level of a claim refers to its place in the local chain of support within a subargument.   Level 1 claims
are the basic contention of a subargument, Level 2 claims are reasons or evidence supporting Level 1
claims, Level 3 claims are reasons or evidence supporting Level 2 claims, and so on.       Tracking level may
be important from a psychological perspective because the use of more levels may indicate that students are
thinking more deeply about an issue.

          It should be noted that this framework incorporates all the elements of the well-known Toulmin
model (1958), but includes other features as well that reflect more of the complexities of actual arguments
(such as divergence).   One  differences   is that many  users of the    Toulmin model   focus on  articulating
unexpressed "warrants" or assumptions made by participants, but identifying unexpressed claims is a
difficult and somewhat unreliable task (van Eemeren et al., 2002) that may or may not add anything to an
analysis. In this study, implicit claims were not analyzed, but it was recognized that sometimes opposition
was made to implicit claims.

Hypotheses
          We would expect that during an on-line discussion, different types of goal instructions would have
effects on different components of argumentation, both type and depth (as measured by number of levels
reflected in an argument). These hypotheses are summarized in the following table:

                                      General Goal                           Specific Goal
                                                                                Counter-

      Depth                   I            I                            I
      Note.  I = Increase. D = Decrease.

As noted previously, although the instruction to generate as many reasons as possible was not effective in
previous  research  when   students   were  writing individual  essays    (Nussbaum  &   Kardash,  2003),  the
dialectical context of on-line  discussions   may   stimulate more potential   ideas in  students.  The  study
therefore tested the hypothesis that in an on-line environment, the total number of reasons would increase
as a result of this goal instruction.   Because    some of these  could   be reasons for reasons,  it was also
hypothesized that depth would increase.      Instructions to generate counterarguments/rebuttals would likely
increase opposition and contingency.    Nussbaum and Kardash (2003) found, however, no effect of this goal
on depth of counterarguments; students did not tend to elaborate their counterarguments but were still
somewhat one-sided in their thinking.    This tendency has been termed the "my-side bias" (Perkins, Farady,
& Bushey, 1991). Because there is no grounds for why the dialectical context would eliminate this bias, it
is again hypothesized that the counterargument goal would have no effect on depth.

          In relation to the more general goals (to explore or to persuade), it is unclear whether these goals
would have an effect.    It could be that the goals are so general that they would have little influence on

                                                     382
students' arguments.  On the other hand, if these general goals do have an effect, the "explore" goal would
likely affect all argument components, because students would be exploring the problem space in various,
multiple ways (as suggested by Mercer's conceptualization of exploratory talk).     The latter hypothesis is
shown in the table. In respect to the persuade goal, it might specifically increase opposition, because it may
cue students to engage in more adversarial discourse, as in a debate.    Students might also generate more
supporting reasons and evidence to make their arguments more persuasive, thus increasing depth.        On the
other hand, because contingent arguments might be viewed as less persuasive (as was found by Nussbaum
& Kardash, 2003), the persuasion goal might decrease contingency.

Method
         Participants consisted of 224   undergraduates   enrolled   in various sections   of  an educational
psychology course, and participated in order to receive course credit.    The majority were female (80%)
with a median age of 26.

         Participants  were randomly    assigned  to  discussion  groups  of three and    used   an electronic
discussion board (WEB-CT) to discuss the following question related to their educational psychology class:
"Does watching television cause children to become more violent?"       The researcher posted the question to
the electronic bulletin board for each group, along with additional instructions (which varied by goal
condition). The additional instructions were:
   Explore:   "Try to explore this issue in-depth to increase your understanding of it."
   Persuade:   "Try to persuade others of your point of view."
   Reasons:    "Provide as many reasons as you can to justify your position, and try to provide evidence
         that supports your reasons."
   Counterarguments/Rebuttals:     "Consider reasons why others disagree with you or might disagree with
         you and why those reasons might be wrong."

A 3 x 3 randomized crossed design was used, with general goal (Explore, Persuade, or None) crossed with
specific goal (Reasons,  Counterarguments,     or None).   All  participants were  first   given  a 45-minute
orientation session on how to use WEB-CT and on the requirements of the study.         The students were told
that they were to have a conversation about this issue and were required to post at least two notes but could
post more.  They were given three days to post the first note and an additional two days to post the second.
After the first three-day period, the researcher posted a "reminder note" that participants should "respond to
one another's notes (post at least two by Saturday)." The reminder note also repeated the goal instructions.
Groups where not all three students posted notes, or which contained less than 80% of the requested notes,
were eliminated from the analysis, reducing the effective sample size to 180 students.

         For coding purposes, each discussion note was scored for both type of argumentation claims made
and level of claim (up to three levels were coded).  All notes were scored independently by two raters, who
then resolved any disagreement through discussion.   All scoring was conducted blind to condition.

Results
         In analyzing the data, outlying cases with z > 3.20 were removed for each outcome variable, as
such extreme cases are generally overly influential and bias statistical estimates (Tabachnick & Fidell,
1996). The number of cases (both individuals and groups) for each condition is shown in Table 2.

         Because participants operated in small groups, it was necessary to use multilevel modeling.       A
multilevel approach is needed because the outcomes for individuals were not statistically independent from

                                                     383
the others in their group (which is of course the whole point of engaging in dialectical argumentation).
This approach resulted in two levels of analysis:       the student level and the group level. MLwiN multilevel
statistical software (Rabash et al., 2000) was used to conduct the tests of statistical significance, taking into
account both of these levels.      Although one could simply use groups as the basic level of analysis, that
approaches significantly decreases the number of cases and therefore statistical power.               A multilevel
approach is therefore preferred.

         Because the data consisted of counts that were not normally distributed (the mode in most cases
was 0), Rabash et al. (2000) recommend fitting a Poisson distribution to the data.         In addition, although
there were   60 groups, the    size  of each group   was  small   (only three).  In this situation, Rabash et al.
recommend refining parameter estimates using Bayesian modeling for small samples with Monte Carlo
simulations. Regression methods (RIGLS) were used to make estimates of all parameters, which were then
combined with prior default assumptions about the shape of each parameter's sampling distribution--for
example, that it is uniform--to produce a posteriori estimates.     Because--in this approach--the estimate of
one parameter affects the estimate of others (includes slopes and variances), the process was repeated
continually (at least 50,000 times).    The parameter estimates from the previous iteration were used as input
for the next, but with one parameter at a time allowed to vary randomly.          This procedure provided more
valid tests of statistical significance. T-tests of the regression slopes were conducted, with the degrees of
freedom (n-k-1) based on the number of groups rather than the number of individuals, as that provided a
more conservative test.

         Although it is usual when using regression to use standardized slope coefficients as estimates of
effect sizes, regression coefficients are difficult to interpret when nonlinear models are employed, so in
what follows we report effect sizes as mean differences, standardized by the standard deviation of the
control  group  (Cohen's  d),    with   significance tests  conducted   as   described  above.   The   means--by
condition--are shown in Table 2.

          The table indicates significant effects for both the persuade and reasons conditions. Both resulted
in significantly more claims than the control conditions (t(49) = 5.02, p < .001, d = 0.42 for "persuade," and
t(49) = 4.27, p < .001, d = 0.60 for "reasons"). These are moderately strong effect size, almost a half of a
standard deviation.  Both conditions also had effects on all three levels of argument, although the effect of
"persuade" was somewhat stronger (ds were 0.4 at both Levels 2 and 3 for "persuade," but only 0.26 and
0.17 for these respective levels for the reasons condition). When examined by type of claim, "persuade"
resulted in both more supporting and opposing claims (t(49) = 3.37, p < .01, d = 0.34 for supporting, t(49) =
2.68, p < .05, d = 0.38 for opposing), but there was no effect on contingent claims.    On the other hand, the
reason condition did have an effect on contingent claims (t(49) = 2.49, p < .05), with a fairly strong effect
size (d = 0.52)  and  a smaller  effect on divergent   claims (t(49)    = 2.14, p < .05, d = 0.25).  Overall,
persuasion resulted in more opposition, and reasons resulted in more contingency and divergence.

          In regards to the explore condition, only the hypothesized effect on divergence was confirmed.
Table 3 indicates an effect on divergence (t(49) = 3.53, p < .001) but the effect size was small (d = 0.16)
and complicated by an interaction with the counterargument/rebuttal condition (t(49) = 2.94, p < .01).
Inspection of the cell means (see Table 4) indicate that the positive effect on divergence did not exist when
the explore goal was combined with the counterargument goal; presumably, students tended to explore
counterarguments rather than ancillary issues.   There was also an Explore x Reasons interaction (t(49) =
2.40, p < .05), indicating that the reason condition did not result in more contingent claims when combined
with the explore goal (see Table 4); rather students tended to diverge.

          Finally, the counterargument condition did result in more oppositional claims (t(49) = 3.35, p <
.01, d = 0.22) and more Level 3 claims (t(49) = 3.24, p < .01, d = 0.19), but in both cases the effects were
small.

Discussion
          One question examined by this study is what type of goal instructions is most effective in an on-
line environment.   Of the various instructions examined, it was the reason instruction ("generate as many
reasons as possible") and the persuade instruction ("persuade others of your point of view") that had the
strongest effects.  The effects of the reason instructions in the on-line, dialectical context were also quite
different than those  found   in a more  individualistic context (Nussbaum       &  Kardash, 2003).  As was
hypothesized, the reason goal was more powerful in the dialectical context where students are exposed to
the ideas of other students. This goal increased the total number of reasons generated as well as argument
depth.  Surprisingly, and of particular importance, this condition also had a fairly strong, positive effect on
contingent  claims   (about  one-half standard deviation).  Interestingly,   when   one  examines the reason
condition uncombined with any general goal, the effect size is more than one standard deviation; both the
explore and persuade conditions may dilute the effect of reasons on contingency (although this point must
be viewed with caution because the Reason x Persuade interaction was not significant).

                                                    385
        Why is it important that the reason goal promotes contingency?     Contingency involves examining
multiple sides of an issue in the same subargument, or holding that the global claim may be true only under
certain conditions.  For example, one might hold that watching TV may cause some children to become
violent only if parents have not taught them how to self-regulate or distinguish reality from fantasy.
Contingent claims contain qualifications which are responses to implicit counterarguments (Toulmin,
1958), in this  case  that not  all children  who  watch  TV   become  violent.  Contingent  claims     reflect
integration of opposing arguments or factors and, for this reason, may be psychologically more valuable in
promoting understanding of concepts.      Also, from a philosophic perspective, contingent arguments are
often stronger than simpler arguments, because the strength of an argument can be viewed as a function of
how well if refutes (or at least takes into account) possible objections (Pollock, 1987; Rips, 1998).  Finally,
contingent claims are  a sign of exploratory talk, which is a desirable feature of on-line discourse. The fact
that a goal instruction to generate "as many reasons as you can think of" results in deeper and more
contingent arguments is therefore of practical importance.  It appears to result in more exploratory talk than
just the general goal "to explore," as this instruction appears too vague to have an effect other than to
encourage students to diverge (and combining the two goals does not appear to be helpful).       The reason
goal appears to encourage students to specifically explore reasons, including opposing factors, although in
the form of contingent rather than opposing claims

        In contrast, a persuasion goal--while also resulting in deeper arguments--does result in more
oppositional rather than contingent claims.    Prior to collecting the study, it was unclear whether a general
goal would have such an effect, but it may be that--compared to "explore"--persuasion is less vague and
more   specific (but  not quite as  specific  as generating reasons).  Compared   to  the reason condition,
persuasion also results in less divergence; students stay on the initial question more rather than exploring
related issues such as how to reduce the amount of violence on television.   Whether divergence is viewed
as good or bad depends on the instructor's pedagogical goals.   If an instructor wants students to focus only
on the initial question for pedagogical reasons (for example, to understand how violence is often caused by
social modeling), then divergence should be avoided; on the other hand, if an instructor wants students to
explore more broadly, for example to gain practice with formulating and solving problems, or to better
connect a topic to their own personal experiences or interests, then divergence might be encouraged,
specifically with a reason goal instruction.

        The   results for  the counterargument/rebuttal   goal were disappointing.   The hypothesis that it
would increase contingency was not confirmed; it did increase opposition, but only weakly.       This goal
instruction was more powerful in the context of writing individual essays (Nussbaum & Kardash, 2003).
The goal instruction was lifted verbatim from Nussbaum and Kardash, but it could be that the requirement
to generate counterarguments AND rebuttals did not fit the dialectical context well; students may know
how to oppose other students' views, but it may not be natural to then try to rebut one's own opposing view.
It may in fact violate implicit rules of dialogic commitment (see Walton, 1998) and may also be too
psychologically complex.    Future research should perhaps examine omitting the rebuttal instruction and
focus more directly only on counterarguments.

        In general, though, it was the reason condition that most facilitated exploratory talk and better
argumentation.    It is encouraging that one can achieve such powerful effects simply by adding a statement
to the end of   a discussion   question.  If  you ask students to find reasons,  they may--when       working
dialectically as  a  group--be  able  to  find   some good  ones  and  to explore  a  topic more      in-depth.
Interestingly, their discourse may also consider opposing ideas and factors, thus overcoming the "my-side"
bias found in previous research (Nussbaum & Kardash, 2003).      Such in-depth exploration of multiple sides
of a topic may enhance students' understanding and learning.
