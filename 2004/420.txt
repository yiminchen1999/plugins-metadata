         Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for examining the ways in
         which classroom context, in conjunction with individual student knowledge and beliefs,
         influences participation and engagement in project-based learning environments. An
         underlying design assumption of project-based curricula is that the goal and role motivate
         the learning of content, and that learning the content in pursuit of the goal leads to better
         content understanding.      However, research to-date has not explored the extent to which
         the goal and role actually motivate student participation in practice. The    framework we
         have developed     is specifically designed    for the analysis   of project-based   learning
         environments    in that  it explicitly considers the influence  of   student role- and goal-
         adoption on participation and engagement in project-based activities over time.          We
         believe that this framework, as we continue to refine it, will prove useful for research on
         participation and engagement in project-based curricula.   Specifically, such a framework
         will help with the identification and design of future lines of research, will facilitate
         comparison across diverse settings, and will provide a starting point for the integration of
         the results.

Introduction
         In project-based curricula, in which students develop content understanding through the pursuit of
authentic problems (Blumenfeld et al., 1991), learners are expected to take on a particular goal and role.
The  goal involves    solving  a problem  (such   as predicting temperature   on a  newly   discovered     planet,
building a playground, or developing a Global Warming recommendation).          The role embodies a particular
way of interacting, and is sometimes explicit (scientific researcher, urban planner, or Global Warming
Advisor) and sometimes implicit (i.e., "inquirer").     It is this goal and role that distinguish project-based
curricula from other curricula, including sets of consecutive activities that share some of the more common
characteristics of project-based curricula ­ such as the use of technology, working in groups, and hands-on
experiments - yet are relatively disconnected from each other in that they are not tied to a role other that
that of being a student or a goal other than that of achieving a particular set of learning objectives.

         An underlying design assumption behind these curricula is that the goal and role will motivate the
learning of content, and that learning the content in pursuit of the goal (which serves to "contextualize"
instruction) will in turn lead to better content understanding (Blumenfeld et al., 1991, Edelson, 2001,
Krajcik, 2001, Rivet, 2000).     However,   while  the  goal and role are  intended   to play a central    part in
motivating activities, and are in turn one of the reasons project-based learning environments potentially
lead  to  deeper content    understanding    than    do the  more  traditional,  non-project-based       learning
environments, research to date has not explored the extent to which the project role and goal actually
motivate student participation in practice.  In fact, little research has been done on motivation in project-
based learning environments at all; what research there is has focused primarily on the characteristics of
individual problem-based activities that engage students, rather than on what goal students have, and what
role they see themselves in, when they participate.

         Our current line of research addresses that gap, through investigating the extent to which students
adopt the role and goal in project-based curricula.     Specifically, this work explores the research questions
of:

                                                      420
         1)  How does the nature/degree of role- and goal-adoption vary among different students and
             across different activities?
         2)  What are the individual and contextual factors that influence the nature of role and goal
             adoption?
         3)  What are the ways in which role and goal adoption influence the nature of participation and
             engagement?

         In this paper, we describe the theoretical framework we have created to guide our investigation
and analysis of participation and engagement in project-based learning environments.                In addition, we will
describe the ways in which we believe this framework may prove useful to others in the field for building
an understanding of such participation and engagement.

Theoretical Framework
         Our theoretical framework represents our "working hypotheses" regarding the ways in which the
curriculum in context, in conjunction with individual student knowledge and beliefs, influences goal
adoption, role adoption, and participation and engagement in project-based curricula.                We developed this
framework to reflect our synthesis of existing motivation and project-based learning literature, and refined
it based on preliminary results of a pilot study conducted in Spring 2003.             This study was conducted in two
8th-grade science classrooms in urban middle schools.           In one class, students participated in the "Struggle
for Survival" life sciences curriculum, where students act as biologists who work to find out why Finches
are dying on the Galapagos Islands. In the other class, students participated in the "Planetary Forecaster"
curriculum, where students act as research scientists working to predict temperature on a newly discovered
planet. Analysis to date has focused primarily on student interviews, which were conducted with 18 case-
study students to explore the nature of student goal and role adoption and the explanations students give for
why they did or did not adopt the goal and role.

         The complete framework can be found at the end of this section (Figure 4); however, rather than
present the complete framework at once, in this section we will build it gradually as we describe the
hypotheses that are embedded in this framework.

         The central hypothesis of our work is that role adoption and goal adoption influence the nature
of participation  and  engagement   in        activities.  Our   framework    considers      role, goal and activity as
separate dimensions of engagement, rather than taking a "one-dimensional" view of engagement in activity
(see Figure 1).

                     Figure 1. Role, goal, and activity and separate dimensions of engagement

         In the framework, we use the word "nature" to encompass both degree and quality of role and goal
adoption, as what it means to adopt the goal and role may differ from student to student or from situation to

                                                          421
situation.  For  example,                  regarding        the        role,      in  some          cases students              may         adopt  the         role  by  actively
pretending to be in that role (say, that of a scientist), while in other cases, students may be considered to
have adopted the role when they simply feel that they are in that role (that is, they "feel like a scientist").
With goal,  some  students                  may         think       of the       goal frequently          while        they       are        doing  an         activity, yet  not
genuinely care about achieving it; other students may think of the goal rarely, yet genuinely care about
achieving it ­ both of these may be considered instances of goal adoption.                                                         These differences in the nature
of role and goal adoption may have meaningful implications regarding the factors that lead to them and
their impact on participation and engagement.

        We also hypothesize that "expectation of success" and "subjective task value" influence goal
adoption, role adoption, and activity engagement (see Figure 2).                                                      We derived this hypotheses based on
Eccles' Expectancy-Value Model (Eccles, 1983), which describes the factors that determine an individual
student's choices in achievement-related situations.                                  We believe that the decision to adopt a role or goal can
be considered as an achievement-related choice, and that Eccles' model is therefore especially appropriate
for exploring our research questions.                        Eccles' model considers a student's expectation of success at a task,
in conjunction with the task's subjective value, as primary influencers on that student's achievement-
related choices. "Subjective task value" includes intrinsic value (enjoyment or subjective interest), utility
value (the extent to which a task relates to current and future goals), attainment task value (the personal
importance   of  doing                well  on         the task),      and       cost  (negative          aspects              of engaging         in the          task, such as
performance anxiety, fear of both failure and success, and the cost of having to forego other choices in
order to make this one).                  While Eccles' model considers the development over time of task-specific beliefs
that in turn influence student performance, persistence, and task choice, we are not focusing on the long-
term development of such beliefs with this current study; rather, we are focusing on the aspects of Eccles'
model that describe the ways in which these beliefs influence students' achievement-related choices.

        In addition to "expectation of success" and "subjective task value", we hypothesize that "fit with
context"   influences goal                 adoption, role              adoption,        and activity                 engagement (see               Figure 2).            "Fit with
context" refers to the extent to which, from the student's perspective, the goal, role and activity (as aspects

pilot interviews, in which student explanations for why they did or did not adopt a particular role indicated
that they were more likely to adopt that role if they felt that the goal they were pursuing, the activity they
were engaged in, and any additional roles they were expected to take on "fit" (rather than conflicted) with
their understanding of what the role entailed.

          Regarding                            context,           our       model           explicitly               addresses                   the potential                    ways            in which             students'
interactions with the "curriculum-in-context" impact their perceptions of the goal, role, and activity
(see Figure 3).          Curriculum-in-context refers to the goal, role and activities as they are represented in the
artifacts, teacher talk/actions, and peer talk/actions.                                                                         This curriculum-in-context (in conjunction with a
student's prior knowledge) determines the student's perception of the goal, role, and activity, which in turn
influences the subjective task value, expectation of success, and fit with context for that goal, role and
activity.

          Finally, we hypothesize that the nature of role adoption, goal adoption and participation and
   engagement change over time based on students' ongoing experiences with the curriculum (see
   Figure 4 for complete framework).                                                         Figure 3 above represents the influence of the curriculum-in-
   context, in conjunction with a student's knowledge and beliefs, on participation and engagement at a
   given point in time in the curriculum.                                                   However, project-based curricula often span days or weeks, and
   the extent to which students are engaged in the goal, role, and activities can change from day to day
   (or, for that matter, from moment to moment).                                                                    Student participation and engagement on any given day
   cannot be fully understood independent of what has transpired on previous days, in that what students
   know and feel regarding the role, goal, and activity is shaped in part by their previous experiences with
   the project role, goal, and activities.                                                 Figure 4 reflects the cumulative effect of a student's experiences
   within the curriculum on role adoption, goal adoption, and student participation and engagement.

  Figure 4.     Influence of student role- and goal-adoption on participation and engagement in project-based activities over time.
            Overall, our model focuses on students' perceptions of themselves and the learning environment, and on
the influence of such perceptions on students' conscious choices (to adopt a role or goal or participate in the
activity).    We  acknowledge                            that      one's actions                    are           not     always            fully     motivated                           by conscious,                    rational          choice.
However, we do believe an examination of students' perceptions and conscious choices will contribute significantly
to our understanding of student participation and engagement in project-based leaning environments.
Applications of the Framework
            We have used this framework to guide the design of a larger scale study, currently underway, in which we
are investigating student role- and goal- adoption in two 7th-grade science classrooms.                                                                                                     In this current study, students
are participating in the "What Will Survive" life sciences curriculum, in which students first take on the role of task
force members who pursue the goal of ridding the Great Lakes of the sea lamprey, and then play the role of
scientists who pursue the goal of finding out why Finches are dying on the Galapagos Islands.                                                                                                                          Data collection for
this study primarily consists of:
  · Pre-surveys to explore students' knowledge and beliefs that, according to the framework, may influence role
     and goal adoption (this includes their science-related beliefs and attitudes and the extent to which they are
     focused on performance goals vs. mastery goals).
  ·  Daily      "mini-surveys"                           to examine      the                     relationships               among           the      high-level                          elements             that,      according           to our
     framework, affect participation and engagement.                                                                     Such elements include the extent to which students adopted

                                                                                                                         424
       the role and goal, their expectation of success for the activity, and the subjective task value of the activity
       (specifically, the extent to which they enjoyed the activity and the perceived usefulness of the activity).
       These mini-surveys will also allow us to explore the patterns over time for these elements.
     · In-depth student interviews to further explore the nature of student goal and role adoption, the explanations
       students give for why they did or did not adopt the goal and role, and the nature of their participation and
       engagement in activities.
     · Classroom     observation to  gather data on  the role, goal, and  activity in context (that  is, the role, goal and
       activities embedded   in   artifacts,  teacher  talk,   and peer   interactions),  as  well   as  apparent   student
       engagement/participation.
          We will refine our working hypotheses, and in turn our framework, based on the results of this current
study, and believe that this framework, as we continue to refine it, will prove useful for continuing research on
participation and    engagement  in  project-based  curricula.  First, this model   will  facilitate comparison    between
curricula, as well as the comparison of findings from other enactments of the same curricula across multiple
classrooms.   This will allow us to look for broader, or more "generalizable", answers to our questions regarding
participation and    engagement   in curricular  contexts.   Second,   in addition    to providing   us  with a high-level
representation of the elements and relationships involved in answering our current research questions, we believe
that this framework    can act   as  a starting  point for the  generation   of additional    questions/issues     regarding
participation and engagement in project-based curricula; exploring these additional questions will allow us to further
refine and elaborate upon the framework and better understand its applicability/usefulness.        Examples of questions
raised by the framework include:
     · How does the actual make-up of the factors that affect role adoption, goal adoption, and participation
       and  engagement     vary   across    students and   situations?    For example,     in pilot  interviews,   students
       emphasize different aspects of the role-context fit in describing how this influenced their adoption of the role
       of scientist. Some students describe the match (or lack thereof) between the role of scientist and the type of
       activity (i.e., they were doing experiments so they felt like scientists), while other students emphasized the
       disconnect between the role of scientist and the purpose/goal of what they were doing (i.e, they didn't feel
       like scientists because they were learning something that was already "out there", whereas scientists come up
       with their own theories).    As another example, regarding the "subjective value" of adopting a role or goal,
       some students may want to take on the role or goal because it is something they have always been interested
       in or because it sounds fun to them; other students may want to take on the role or goal simply because they
       want to get a good grade in the class.   These differences in the make-up of the factors such as role-context fit
       and subjective task value may lead to quantitative and qualitative differences in role adoption, goal adoption,
       and participation and engagement in the activity.
     · Which aspects of context are most salient in influencing students' perceptions of the expected role and
       goal?  It is likely that artifacts, teacher talk, and peer talk may all point to different expected roles and goals.
       For example, in our pilot study, students were introduced to their role (that of scientific researcher) and goal
       (that of predicting temperature on a fictional, newly-discovered planet) in a letter from an International Space
       Agency.    In  interviews, students'  specifically  mentioned   this artifact  as  causing  them   to  feel like real
       scientists charged with doing something important.      Students continued to receive similar memos throughout
       the curriculum.  However, while an intent (from the designers' perspective) of these additional memos was to
       help keep students in the role and focused on the goal, students did not mention these on-going memos as
       influencing their perceptions of the role and goal.   Rather, it seemed that other aspects of the context (such as
       the way the teacher addressed them or the relative roles of their peers in group activities) kept them in the role
       of students focused on the goal of simply getting through the task at hand.       Therefore, the ways in which the
       different aspects of context work together (or against each other) in influencing students' perceptions of the
       role and goal (and in turn their perceptions of fit with context, their desire to take on the role, and their
       expectations of success) will be worth exploring in greater detail, as such an understanding can help designers
       and curriculum implementers know where to invest their effort in creating learning environments that actively
       engage students.

     · What is the nature of the relationships between the factors that affect student adoption of the role and
       goal (and in turn engagement and participation in the activity)?            While we hypothesize that a student's
       expectation of success in a role/goal, the subjective value of adopting the role/goal, and the perceived "fit" of

                                                           425
      the role/goal with context all influence that students' adoption of the role/goal, the relative influence of each
      one of these factors on role/goal adoption may vary.               For example, in our pilot study, there was a particular
      set of activities in which most students said they did not feel like a scientist for reasons related to fit of the
      role with the context (i.e., they said they were working with data someone else collected rather than collecting
      their own data, or they were working on a problem someone else had solved rather than generating new
      knowledge, or they were doing the same thing everyone else in the class was doing rather than working on
      their own problem).      However, one student in particular said he thought of himself as a scientist during those
      activities; this was the one student in the class who planned on being a scientist when he grew up and
      therefore really wanted to play the role of scientist.            So, it seems that where students are very interested in
      playing the role of scientist (and thus subjective task value is high), they may not require as great a degree of
      role-context fit, while students who are less interested initially in playing the role of scientist may require a
      greater fit between role and context in order to adopt that role.
    · What are the implications (regarding the factors that lead to role/goal adoption and the relationship of
      such adoption to participation and engagement) of differences in the type of role and goal adoption?
      Earlier in this paper, we described role adoption as potentially encompassing both "pretending to be" and
      "feeling like" a particular role, and goal adoption as potentially encompassing both "thinking of" and "caring
      about" a particular goal (there may be other aspects of role and goal adoption as well).                      The factors that have
      the greatest influence on role and goal adoption may be different depending upon the nature of such adoption.
      For example, with role, "feeling like" that role may be most influenced by fit with context, while "pretending
      to be" may be most influenced by subjective task value (this was potentially happening in the previous
      example, where the student who wanted to be a scientist when he grew up "thought of himself" as a scientist
      during the activities, yet students did not "feel like" scientists when what they were doing did not match their
      perception of the role of a scientist).         The relationship between these variations in the nature of role adoption
      and the       nature of engagement       and    participation   in activities        may    be different  as  well.  For example,
      "pretending to be" may influence one's more deliberate decisions regarding how to participate (in that one
      who is pretending to be, say, a scientist, may choose actions based on what one thinks a scientist would do,
      even above and beyond what is required by the teacher), while "feeling like a scientist" may have a greater
      influence on the affective component of engagement (perhaps students feel better about themselves and the
      activity when they feel like scientists).
    · What (additional) relationships exist between role adoption, goal adoption, and participation in the
      activity?      Our current work (as reflected in our research questions and the framework) focuses the premise
      that students can choose to adopt the role or goal (based on their individual knowledge and beliefs and their
      perception of the curricular context), and that such role or goal adoption in turn affects their participation in
      an activity.    However, it is likely that the direction of the relationship between role, goal, and activity goes the
      other way as well, in that participation in an activity may cause students to take on the role or goal as a result
      of that participation.       Ultimately,     it may be that     a  role can act       as a   hook  into   the activity (though      not
      necessarily the only hook), and that participation in the activity leads to further "taking on" of the role, which
      leads to continued participation, etc.          In addition, the relationship between role adoption and goal adoption
      may be worth exploring further; caring about the goal may cause one to be more interested in taking on the
      role, and adopting a role may cause one to be more interested in pursuing a particular goal.
       While our current study will allow us to shed some light on the questions described here, we believe that
future research must continue to investigate these questions if we are to develop an understanding of participation
and engagement       in project-based    curricula.     Ultimately,     the understanding          evolving from    the   pursuit    of  such
questions will allow us to design engaging learning environments that better-promote student learning.
