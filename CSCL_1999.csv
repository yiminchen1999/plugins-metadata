While valuable, the discussion is often decontextualized from the situation in which it makes sense. Anchored collaboration environments provide a mechanism for connecting collaboration to digital media content, such as Web-based syllabi and assignment descriptions. The most significant learning context in most classes is still the face-to-face whole class lecture or discussion. The Classroom 2000 project at Georgia Tech is capturing classroom experiences in multiple media: audio, video, presenter's slides, presenter's whiteboard markings, and students' notes. By connecting the Classroom 2000 captured lectures to a persistent collaboration space, we provide (a) a mechanism for asynchronous collaboration that is anchored in class contexts and (b) a means for treating class activity as persistent learning medium for later comment and collaborative extension. This paper describes a pilot study to create a collaborative discussion space anchored in captured classroom lectures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

For most design problems (ranging from urban design to graphics design and software design) that we have studied over many years, the knowledge to understand, frame, and solve these problems does not exist, but is constructed and evolved during the process of solving them, exploiting the power of the ""symmetry of ignorance"" and ""breakdowns."" From this perspective, access to existing information and knowledge (often seen as the major advance of new media) is a very limiting concept. Many social and technological innovations are limited to provide primarily better access, leading to ""consumer"" cultures. Our approach focuses and creates support for lifelong learning activities grounded in informed participation and empowerment, allowing learners to incrementally acquire ownership in problems and contribute actively to their solution.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:38Z (GMT).

The goal of this study was to determine if students with different levels of experience, knowledge, and skill in learning through design are aware of these differences; and also if they are aware of how this variation affects their collaborative interactions. Toward this end, sixty-two fourth and fifth-grade designers with varying levels of expertise in design and programming were interviewed following their participation in a 10-week learning through design project. Students were asked to identify differences between experienced and inexperienced designers. Their responses were classified via an emergent coding scheme. Results showed that students were aware of differences not only in requisite skills, but also how these skills contributed to collaborative interactions. Students cited knowledge and interaction differences in relation to visible skills like programming more often than other meta-design skills, such as planning and project monitoring.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:38Z (GMT).

The project included thirty-eight sixth grade classrooms (approximately 1000 students) in eight public school districts and three private schools throughout Illinois. The classrooms selected are all low SES, high mobility and high special education enrollments. The project provided classrooms with a new computer, pedagogy and technology for model building. The educational goals were selected to achieve the math standards of data collection, representation, and interpretation. Results indicate an actual cost, including a new computer and wiring, of $225 per student participating in the project. Teacher surveys and observation in classroom visits indicate over 80% active use of modeling software by students in modeling energy systems within their schools. Over 70% of teachers report that they will continue using the modeling software beyond the project end.

I identify strengths and weaknesses associated with collaborative learning, linking them to the instructional approaches used in an eighth-grade science curriculum where students design a desert house. The house design activity provides a context for connecting instructional goals and technical innovations. Focusing on how students specializing in different areas can share ideas and provide feedback for each other, I show how social and technical supports can work to achieve common goals. I examine two assumptions about how an expanded repertoire of models contributes to knowledge integration. First, I provide evidence that considering more alternatives leads to improved designs only if students have a framework for organizing those alternatives and selecting between them. Then, I provide evidence that encouraging students to iteratively refine their ideas contributes to knowledge integration. Finally, I show how these cognitive goals can be pursued through social and technical innovations which seek to encourage knowledge integration by making thinking visible for students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:39Z (GMT).

Our hypothesis was that a graphical communication tool would facilitate grounding processes, i.e. the mutual understanding of one or a few utterances and thereby the construction of a shared solution. We conducted an empirical study with 20 pairs solving an enigma in a MUD environment enriched with a whiteboard. The results show that the whiteboard was used less used to disambiguate difficult concepts in conversation than as a tool for distributed regulation of the task. The graphical features of the whiteboard were less exploited thatn the fact that information displayed on the whiteboard was persistent. Subjects selected the communication medium by matching the persistency of display (how long information is displayed) with persistency of information (how long it remains valid). Their grounding behaviour also takes into account the probability that some piece of information probabilty that some piece of infornmation is misundersis misunderstood or disagreed upon.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:39Z (GMT).

The study presents a new metric, cross-disciplinary learning, as a journey from the state of island of knowledge (discipline-centric) to a state of understanding of the goals, language, and representations of the other disciplines. The metric proposes a four-tiered classification, designed to measure the students' evolution of cross-disciplinary learning, that is based on the perspectives of cognitive and situative learning theories. The four tiers are islands of knowledge, awareness, appreciation, and understanding. An additional metric is based on a longitudinal assessment that tracks the programmatic changes such a cross-disciplinary education program can lead to. The paper describes the multidisciplinary, collaborative, geographically distributed teamwork learning environment, the assessment methodology, data collection and analysis, and discusses the preliminary results.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:40Z (GMT).

The course was delivered entirely online through the Lohn Lab, Centre for Distance Education at SFU. Students were from both the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Applied Sciences, which allowed for cross-disciplinary collaborative work. Most course tasks required the students to create unique human figure animations using Life Forms 3-D human figure animation software and give aesthetic critiques on the work of others. To investigate how online collaborative tasks may foster creativity, we analyzed conference transcripts, interviews, and questionnaires. Transcript analysis showed that students actively collaborated. The message exchange also revealed that the environment functioned well as a means of promoting student-centered collaboration. The insight and creativity in using Life Forms that the non-dance students contributed helped dance students free themselves from their established conceptions of dance pedagogy and aesthetics. Issues that hindered collaboration were mostly related to students' particular preferences and software problems (downloading/uploading time). The majority of students interviewed supported the online collaborative Life Forms assignment tasks, but some were negative about collaborative assignments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:41Z (GMT).

Given the proven potential of computer-mediated instruction, what can account for the lack of progress? This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of many of the existing computer-mediated learning environments and suggests that the learning theories that lie behind them lead to designs that do not fit with nor change the basic participation structures of the classroom. We argue instead for Activity Centered Design (ACD), a model of design for Computer Supported Collaborative Learning environments, based on the following assumptions: that activity is mediated by cultural tools, that activity must be conceptualized on a number of interdependent levels, and that conceptual understanding is first established socially. We then critique our own existing learning environment, the Probability Inquiry Environment, from the ACD perspective.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It supports 1) creation of a virtual city with its different spaces, objects and interactive characters, 2) communication between the users, and 3) introspection about role models, personal and community values. This paper describes the theoretical framework that conceives identity as dynamically constructed by putting together diverse and conflicting elements and values.

When these external data are pages on the WWW, the corresponding conceptual model takes the role of an information index and determines the navigational structure between these pages (corresponding to one or more views on the external data). The conceptual model also serves as a schema for the integration of new pages (similar to the role of a database schema). In this paper we show how such a model can be used to support three main aspects of constructivist learning in a computer supported teaching environment, namely structural support for goal-oriented learning and projects,the integration of student projects into hyperbook based lecture material and the implementation of student annotations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:43Z (GMT).

Children's activity and engagement levels when playing on a computer with multiple input devices was compared to other traditional collaborative settings (paper- based, common desktop configuration). Preliminary qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed three main benefits of providing each child with access to a mouse and a cursor: (a) children exhibited a significantly higher level of engagement; (b) children tended to be more active; and (c) children significantly preferred playing on a computer equipped with multiple input devices and cursors.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:44Z (GMT).

Preliminary studies of 110 sixth and ninth grade students have been conducted where students worked in pairs while investigating the concept of global warming within a fully immersive, 3- D, virtual reality based model of Seattle called Global Change World (GCW). Field research being conducted during June of 1999 is expanding on these preliminary studies by seeking to identify differences in science concept learning between solitary users, paired-peer users, and agent- guided users interacting within the GCW virtual learning environment (VLE).We have observed that most students thoroughly enjoy their experiences with GCW. It is also apparent that peer collaboration plays a significant role in regards to the level of student engagement within the VLE. Therefore, we believe that the potential for GCW to facilitate valuable collaborative learning experiences in conjunction with more traditional classroom activities is great. Our continuing research is intended to focus more closely on the impact of both peer and expert- novice collaboration on the preconceived or ""naive"" scientific concepts held by students. The paper that follows describes our research to date, and will be amended to include the methods and results of our research-in- progress.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:44Z (GMT).

Finally, the representations produced by the system, used by students to write a synthesis and by the teacher to debrief the class are analysed in relation to metacognition.

Project Lighthouse is exploring the role of computers in educational reform throughout Thailand. The goal of this particular pilot project was to help villagers of all ages and backgrounds gain technological fluency, cultivate a sense of ownership and mastery, and develop knowledge and pride about their cultural heritage and history while creating an on-line magazine for their village. The constructionist methodology guided our work and helped people to view themselves not only as consumers but also as producers of information. The project employed a software environment named Pluto, an authoring tool specially designed at the MIT Media Lab to support community-based collaborative electronic publishing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:45Z (GMT).

Data analysis focused on: (1) defining the cognitive skill of coaching collaboration, (2) identifying cues that coaches use to detect and diagnose peer interaction impasses, and (3) specifying how coaches remedy these impasses. Coaching collaboration is an extension of the task of mentoring in one-on-one interactions. It involves three levels of diagnosis: diagnosing problems in the task situation, in students' knowledge and problem-solving process, and in peer interactions. One-on-one instructional interactionse.g., medical rounds consultations between an expert physician and a residentinvolve only the first two levels. We describe cues that can signal to a human or automated coach that intervention is necessary and can indicate what the cause of a peer interaction impasse is. During problem solving, the avionics experts tended to focus on giving advice that would keep students on a productive solution path. They seldom addressed problems at the interaction level e.g., by prompting a student who evidently knew what to do next to help his peer. However, experts and students used the post-practice reflective discussions to more fully address knowledge gaps, misconceptions, and interaction-level problems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:45Z (GMT).

From this perspective, learning is seen as the process of multiple voices coming into contact, both within and across speaker-produced utterances. Examples are provided of two types of studies based on such a theory of learning: studies of the appropriation of a social language and studies of speech genres. I conclude by recounting the potential advantages of adopting dialogicality as a conceptual basis for ongoing work in CSCL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:46Z (GMT).

In order to enhance interactions further, a system should support externalization of each learner in an easily recognizable manner. Through such externalization, learners can actively collaborate or conflict with each other through discussions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A study is reported where pupils worked in small groups in computer-based classroom activity within the framework of a six year-old innovation program in a primary school. A combined ethnographic and discourse analytic model is used to describe group dynamics in four groups of pupils (aged 8-11) involved in tasks of exploratory learning. We analyzed the data taking three distinct perspectives, a personal or insiders perspective, an interactionist perspective and a social norms perspective. The former revealed the pupil to be a person who seemed to perceive the society within which he/she was called upon to act, as a forum in which to claim and defend his/her social role. The interactionist perspective brought forward the issue of role negotiation and its overbearing presence in social exchange in the form of groupthink, role confusion and vagueness. Finally, the group and classroom social norms, which seemed to have emerged as functional within these societies, had a judgmental character.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:47Z (GMT).

Virtual worlds have traditionally been developed as games, in fact, most virtual worlds today are games. A virtual campus has been developed in the Architecture Faculty at the University of Sydney that is based on some of the concepts of virtual worlds. The virtual campus is a place on the internet where students can go to take courses, meet with academic staff, and communicate with other students. The development of the virtual campus has been influenced by research in design science and is based on the conceptual metaphor of architectural design. The design of the virtual campus is considered at three levels: the implementation level, the representation level, and the interface level. Identifying these levels provides a basis for the design of virtual worlds for professional and educational environments. The consideration of the representation level results in a consistent use of a conceptual metaphor so that a person in the virtual campus can make use of the facilities in an intuitive manner.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:48Z (GMT).

Students develop their understanding through sustained inquiry that pursues collective goals of understanding; it is driven by student questions and explanations, in self-directed small groups. Although it can be practiced without computer support, computer software such as Knowledge ForumTM is designed to support such collaborative learning. ""Widgets"" are software user interface elements that display information and allow the user to manipulate the information display or to accomplish some task. This paper suggests specific classes of widgets that might help learners better attain knowledge building objectives, by distinguishing between the substance of knowledge building and the ""meta- communication"" which surrounds its development. Widgets designed according to knowledge building principles may help facilitate and articulate this meta- communication component of knowledge building. This is particularly so in distance learning, where the meta-communication usually cannot occur outside the system, as it could in a face to face environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:49Z (GMT).

In the light of this theory and based on our previous experience, we propose an approach for the development of context-based virtual learning environments. These are virtual worlds, which the learners themselves can create and modify. They therefore provide a customized learning context in which all learning processes and communications between learners can be situated. The characteristics of our approach are: the use of perceptual metaphors, the flexible combination of these metaphors within the learning environment, and the support for awareness of the context and the social interaction within it. Collaborative hypermedia technology is used to construct and to represent places and information in the environment and then to navigate within it. The prototype system provides rich and flexible learning contexts and supports various forms of social interaction for communities of practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:49Z (GMT).

Medical students are equipped neither with relevant experience nor appropriate schemas to effectively design these experiments. Providing novice learners with real-world experiences are not always feasible due to safety, time, and cost. However, simulated experimental design environments can make these experiences possible. Computer models can promote new ways of thinking, facilitate multiple representation of problems, model the inquiry process, and provide explicit external representations. The Oncology Thinking Cap is one such modeling environment that provides students with experiences in designing and simulated clinical trials. In this paper, we present a case study of a group of fourth year medical students working collaboratively at designing Phase II clinical trials to test a cancer drug, Pittamycin. The trials were designed with a special interface that served to promote task-centered discussion and the construction of a shared problem space. The students became aware of the factors involved at this complex task and used the feedback to revise their understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:50Z (GMT).

We focus on the second aspect, called knowledge negotiation, by which the learners' common understanding is construed. However, common understanding comes in degrees. We provide a theoretical perspective for the negotiation process and propose a quantification of shared knowledge, called the degree of agreement (degreement).

Created as a partnership between the Baltimore City Public Schools, the University of Maryland, and corporate and public sponsors, MELC was designed to investigate how an electronic learning community could be created around the development and use of a multimedia digital library for teacher-generated lesson plans and activities. In addition to audio, video, image, text, and web resources available in the library, multiple communications technologies (i.e., a community web site, email, a threaded discussion board, and distance learning laboratories) have supported collaboration and interaction among the teacher and university participants. In this paper we present a preliminary analysis of the impact of these technologies on teacher interaction and technology use. We find a substantial level of teacher communication and collaboration across media and we look for evidence that the multiple channels of interaction facilitate teachers professional development and increasing comfort with technology.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:52Z (GMT).

Under development in Java and related frameworks, MEOW introduces the concepts of persons, places, and things in a way intended to bind together many existing and emerging Internet services (e.g., web, email, ftp, search, recommendation) that are useful to a virtual community. Our goal is for MEOW to become a flexible, powerful, yet inexpensive platform for all forms of educational research and practice on the Internet. We invite others to join TAPPED IN and help us design the social spaces and technology to address the implications of online communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:53Z (GMT).

While there are clear pedagogical benefits to replicating scientific processes in a controlled classroom setting, students often have difficulty comprehending how such phenomena manifest on larger scales and connecting their lab results to the real world. The WorldWatcher data visualization software adds a novel dimension to classroom investigations by allowing students to investigate and discuss global climate phenomena within a globally situated geographic context. This paper will discuss the design of an integrated classroom curricular unit on global warming in which WorldWatcher activities and traditional classroom labs complement each other in order to support student collaboration in classroom science investigations. Based on analyses of students collaborating in pairs and in whole-class discussions, we will argue that our two-pronged approach to curriculum design represents an effective framework for introducing innovative computer-supported inquiry tools in urban middle school science classrooms while remaining sensitive to the existing practices of teachers and students in these contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:54Z (GMT).

Therefore the comparison of interest for us is between DTVI and TVI: would the audio and video technology used to support a distributed group enable DTVI students to achieve the higher grades attainable in TVI?

While piloting WebGuide in a middle school classroom and a graduate seminar, we encountered a variety of issues related to both software design and classroom practices. Some of these issues are common to experiences with similar systems and some have to do specifically with support for perspectives. In this paper we review seven of the major issues encountered with an eye toward suggestions for future work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:56Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These environments have used a variety of representations for recording information such as alternate hypotheses, empirical observations, and evidential relations (e.g., node-link graphs, structured lists, and containers). There are both empirical and theoretical reasons to believe that the expressive constraints imposed by a representation and the information (or lack of information) that a representation makes salient may have important effects on students' discourse during collaborative learning. However, to date no systematic study has been undertaken to explore possible effects. This paper outlines a research agenda to address this need; provides theoretically motivated predictions; and reports initial results from a pilot study. Students worked together in groups of two on hypertext-based ""science challenge"" problems. Two groups used each of free text (MS Word), matrix (Excel) or graph (Belvedere) representations of evidence, for a total of six groups. Analysis of discourse transcripts suggests that these representations have quite different effects on the extent to which students discuss evidential relations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:56Z (GMT).

This educational system is intended to foster writing skills through a collaborative learning process that stimulates intensive interaction among learners who edit the same document. It is designed to encourage the writer's awareness of readers and intensive interaction among learners. It has four characteristics: (1) learners are informed when someone else is following their writing process on their screen; (2) learners can instantly see what other learners are writing and revising; (3) the whole newspaper is always displayed; and (4) learners can see which parts of the newspaper other learners are writing and refer to their editing. The authors conducted experiments with the editing system in an elementary school. And the results indicate that (1) students interacted and collaborated well in the writing process; (2) they revised articles repeatedly through interacting with one another; and (3) the system supported the collaborative writing process.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:56Z (GMT).

To examine whether the use of the CMC systems could meet these ends, students' dialogues are characterised in terms of their constructive and argumentative contributions and by their focus on the meaning and application of concepts. In addition, we compare different forms of support, from peer coaching synchronous discussions, offering graphical support at the interface to reflective moderation in asynchronous discussions. Although we compare different systems and assignments, the interplay between focused argumentation and constructive contributions allows us to analyse and compare interaction and learning in different CMC systems, with and without forms of pedagogical support.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:57Z (GMT).

Participatory Simulations Activities can support new forms of classroom interaction and can serve to catalyze the engagement with dynamic systems modeling as a core feature of the education of all students. To accomplish these goals, we introduce a new architecture, HubNet. HubNet is an open client-server architecture, which enables many users at the ""Nodes"" (currently TI graphing calculators) to control the behavior of individual objects or agents and to view the aggregated results on a central computer known as the Hub. This network of nodes is integrated with a powerful suite of modeling, analysis and display tools that together give both the capacity to ""fly' the system in intuitive mode, to reflect on the emergent result of their simulation and, also, to encode their strategies as rules which the system can then run independently. The HubNet system is being used in several middle and secondary classrooms. An illustrative example of classroom use is presented.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:58Z (GMT).

An examination of learning communities suggests that students' knowledge building should improve if CSCL designs attend to, and support, each of the cohesive factors.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-19T19:11:58Z (GMT).
