The problem addressed in the study was whether elementary school students are able to engage with an interrogative process of generating and transforming their own research questions and improve their conceptual understanding in a way that is analogous with scientific inquiry. A further aim was to examine how discourse interaction and collaboration between the students facilitated advancement of their question-driven inquiry. Conceptual tools developed by Jaakko Hintikka’s interrogative model of inquiry were applied for analyzing the students’ process of inquiry.,Posters

The argumentation tool is one component of the Knowledge Integration Environment (KIE) Internet-based learning suite for science education. The argument representations make student thinking visible during individual and collaborative activities in the classroom. The paper elaborates on how the cognitive mechanisms and learning goals shaped the design of the SenseMaker software and presents results from several formative classroom trials of the tool. Student arguments vary based on their epistemological beliefs about the nature of science. Students report using the SenseMaker tool to support both individual and collaborative learning during their classroom projects.,Parallel Session Papers

We provide quantitative data that suggests that seventh grade students who used PIE learned some of the basic principles of probability. Two cases studies are that illustrate how communication supported by computer-mediated representations contributed to this success.

Features of the activity include: interactive graphical interface, two- and three-dimensional views, sound feedback, and real-time written and spoken communication. Mathematical concepts, including area, perimeter, volume, and tiling of surfaces, are embedded in the task. A field study with 134 elementary school children was undertaken to assess the learning and collaborative potential of the activity. Specifically the study addressed how different modes of communication and different task directives affected learning, interpersonal attitudes, and the perceived value and enjoyment of the task. It was found that playing led to academic gains in the target math areas, and that the nature of how the task was specified significantly impacted the size of the gains. The mode of communication was found to affect attitudes towards the game and the player's partner.

In the workplace, instructional designers work with other specialists, but rarely work with other instructional designers. This isolation from their peers, eliminates the possibilities for social learning through observation, and constrains designers' growth to individual reflection on their own practice. While professional growth through reflective practice is ubiquitous, there are a number of known difficulties that constrain the amount of growth. Because routine expertise is tacit, it is difficult for designers to articulate the thinking that supports their routine practices. Without articulation, reflection cannot proceed. A related ""constructivist"" problem, the tendency to perceive current situations as variants of prior situations, acts as a filter on detecting novelty in new situations.",Posters

One important feature of such environments is the extent to which students are able to collaborate with teachers, experts with their peers without losing control away their control of their own learning process. This paper looks at the architectural design studio as a model for dealing with this balance between control and collaboration in open-endedlearning. In particular, this paper looks at using computers to create a ""mathematics studio"" where students learn mathematics using the pedagogy of the design studio. The paper presents two studies: one of how the design studio provides a model for collaborative work, the other exploring the use of computers to adapt the studio model to mathematics learning. 'Ihese two studies show that the design studio can provide an effective model for thinking about collaboration through design activities, and that the design studio model can be used successfully in mathematics learning with the help of computer technology.

Although CSCL does not yet have widespread use in the classroom, laboratory studies of the kind we present here can shed light on how teachers can benefit from CSCL environments designed to encourage reflection on their own professional practice. While much is known about how teachers intervene in traditional classroom and tutoring settings (e.g. Douglas, 1991, Fox, 1993, Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975), less research has been carried out on tutoring interactions in computer mediated situations. The generic CSCL environment ConNeCT (Confrontation Negotiation and Construction of Text) was specially designed to promote discussion on a meta-cognitive level (cf. between students performing a collaborative text production task. We chose the domain of sound propagation for our study. We show how ConNeCT can provide teachers with a way of (i) studying the process by which students collaboratively solve problems in our chosen domain and (ii) reflecting on their own activity. We thus address the following questions within our structured CSCL environment : (1) how do teachers analyze students' collaborative problem solving activity in preparation for tutoring?, (2) how do teachers tutor collaborating dyads? and (3) what is the relation between (1) and (2)? Our study was designed to answer these questions by analyzing a teacher's annotations of a series of CSCL interaction traces and asking for clarifications through interviews and by automatically tracing to file the ensuing on-line teacher-student-student trilogue tutoring sessions in order to compare the teacher's annotations and goals with what actually happened during the trilogues. The first part of our study took place in the classroom where the students were shown a film on sound and asked to write a descriptive text of a situation concerning two tambourines. On a subsequent day in the laboratory, pairs of students carried out the remaining problem-solving in three phases within the context of ConNeCT. In phase 1, the students expressed their opinions for their own and their partner's text. In phase 2, the students discussed their texts and produced a common text. Then in phase 3, after having analyzed the interaction trace, the teacher tutored the students. We present an analysis of how teachers analyze collaborative problem-solving interaction traces issued from ConNeCT. We use an example trilogue sequence along with an interaction trace annotated by a teacher to illustrate that despite appearances of the students' final solution, the trace permitted the teacher to see they had not understood an element crucial to the description of sound and therefore was able to tutor them accordingly. We conclude that teachers can gain knowledge on students' conceptions by studying collaborative problem-solving interaction traces and that introducing teachers to a CSCL environment such as ConNeCT can give them information relevant to tutoring. In future work, we intend to explore the use of CSCL environments for promoting reflection on the part of teachers.",Posters

Incorporating domain-specific strategic support in the design of these environments can make student investigations and discussions more productive by focusing them on key variables and relationships in the domain. However, interacting with these environments may not be enough to help students develop understandings and ways of communicating that are consistent with scientific views. A support system that combines interactions with these environments with teacher-student discussions in both small-group and whole-class formats provides more comprehensive support. We describe a computer-based investigation environment that incorporates domain-specific strategic support, where students investigate an episode of natural selection in the wild. The environment was used as part of a unit on evolution at a Chicago public high school.

The target environment was a computer-networked database system in which students externalize their thoughts in the form of texts or graphics, then elaborate their thoughts by structuring with links or by commenting. Thirty students in a 5th- and 6thgrade combined classroom participated in this study as part of their regular curriculum. The students studied ""how heat affects matters."" Contents of their discourse in the database were evaluated by two independent raters from the perspective of whether critical conceptual changes happened in the students' explanations, then the students were divided into High Conceptual Change (HCC) learners and Naive learners. Further, the same contents were evaluated by two other independent raters from the perspectives of (1) what types of explanations the students generated, and (2) how they applied their explanations across different problem contexts. Results showed that HCC learners generated more explanations and more frequently used their explanations across multiple contexts, particularly ones which they had studied before CSILE sessions. A further case analysis manifested critical differences in the movement in the problem space between a HCC and a Naive learner after generating a new type of explanations. The HCC learner used the type of explanations across contexts in which they had rich information, whereas the Naive learner did not. Thus, explanation-based exploration and progressive learning in knowledge-rich contexts were found to be crucial to deeper conceptual understanding.",Parallel Session Papers

Through longitudinal observations of a music group learning to cover (i.e., play) other groups’ songs, and an analysis of the computational requirements for song covering, we show how simultaneous group activity creates — as a sideeffect — emergent structures that can sequence individual behavior. In short, local activity creates global cues that can then direct local action. We argue that this is not specific to music groups, but that global cues emerge in any simultaneous group activity in which individuals have access to others' on-going performances. We discuss the importance of our results for distributed cognition research, learning in group contexts, and for the design of technological support for collaborative learning.",Parallel Session Papers

The results indicate that gesturing has an important role to play when subjects are discussing collisions since they use their hands to denote speed and force of an impact. More surprisingly, however, gesturing was also associated with problem solving success when subjects were supporting one another with very positive feedback and also when disagreements arose between them. Mutual gesturing also impacted upon the planning process of the investigation. However, more mutual gesturing and gazing occurred with female pairs rather than male and mixed gender dyads. Problem solving success also correlated with gaze which again was associated with cognitive planning and the provision of positive and negative feedback among partners. To conclude our main finding is that differences in non-verbal communication strategies effect not only the strategies that progress the collaborative process but more importantly also those that influence the understanding of the problem space. These results suggest the quality of video linkage will play an important role in collaborative solving for distance learners.",Parallel Session Papers

We conducted a within subjects experiment, observing 8 groups of seventh grade students working for one week under the supervision of high school age counselors. The students used two different software packages to make two different movies. This experiment demonstrated that students, given adequate support, can quickly learn to use the technology and can make their first movie in as little as 5 hours. When we focused on the quality of their movies and on the moviemaking process, we discovered great variability in these areas. Learning effect was great, the second movies were significantly better than the first. More time spent in the idea development led to movies of higher quality. Counselors' interaction and constructive criticism had significant effect on the movie quality.",Posters

In that short span, however, the team of researchers has developed eight different prototype software systems and evaluated them in a variety of settings with middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students. In this paper, we reflect on some of the overall lessons learned through this work. We have developed an approach to instruction that involves students' learning through solving real-world problems. We help students manage the complexity of these problems in several ways. First, we use the methodology from problem-based learning (PBL) to help students structure their problem-solving. Second, we provide students with case libraries to help them learn from the experience of others. Third, we provide support for student reflection. Part of these ideas developed out of the close fit that we saw between the PBL educational methodology and the cognitive model derived from case-based reasoning [1]. Later work has focused on merging what we know about the design process with the PBL classroom methodology.",Parallel Session Papers

TAPPED IN integrates synchronous and asynchronous communication, document storage and sharing, and interaction with virtual objects in a venue patterned after a real-world conference center. Teachers can log into TAPPED IN to share Web resources, hold meetings and workshops, engage in mentoring, and conduct collaborative inquiries with the aid of familiar discoursesupport artifacts such as whiteboards, file cabinets, and bulletin boards. Our WWW user interface and joint-Web-browsing capabilities enable teachers to collaborate more effectively in the presence of Web-based resources. Users who have a Web browser that supports Java Telnet applets can connect to TAPPED IN through their Web browser by using our Java applet, TAPestry, which combines a live Telnet connection with a browser window. TAPestry allows users to project (or ""push"") a Web page to another user's Web browser. Unlike most MUVEs, TAPPED IN can accept email to TAPPED IN users from the Internet and to allow members to send, reply to, and forward email from TAPPED IN to any external email address. We have also developed a variety of data collection protocols and tools to automatically log usage data and transcripts of activities. Results of a pilot test indicate that teachers can learn to use TAPestry for Website tours in less than an hour and that satisfaction with the capability is high. The poster will illustrate TAPPED IN design and show vignettes of how it is being used.",Posters

This poster focuses on a component of a software framework that helps build knowledge communities by capitalizing on the multiple perspectives available within any population. The framework structures an array of resources that encourage learners to reflect on what they know and to contrast it with other people’s perspectives. It organizes the resources through a cyclical process of inquiry and problem solving that follows these steps: the presentation of a challenge, generating ideas, viewing multiple perspectives, doing research, testing your mettle, and finally “going public” by publishing what you’ve learned. An authoring environment called STAR Legacy (Software Technology for Action and Reflection) provides a vehicle for “learning designers” to structure various media resources that support a learner’s thinking during the process of exploring a particular challenge. In this presentation we emphasize how multiple perspectives bring together experts and learners.",Posters

It goes on to define the technical, sociohistorical and political-ideological levels of IT and to identify four theoretical constructs: tutorial, machine-as-human, tool kit and catalyst. Pervading these constructs is the understanding that IT can be used as an ideological agent, which is crucial if we are to connect theoretical foundations with practice. The authors list the foundational premises for a pedagogy of informatics and give practical examples, which emphasize a process of capacitation.

It provides children with the opportunity to explore mathematics as one of many symbol systems that have been built for the purposes of communication. We designed a sequence of four two-person games centered on the theme of codes and secret messages and conducted formative evaluation of the games. By pairing tools for the creation of codes and authoring of coded messages with a full featured email messaging system, KidCode enables children to gain experience with many kinds of symbolic representations. Message authoring can consist of text, graphics, and even animations. Similarly, with KidCode children can advance from an understanding of symbolic representation of object/noun type entities for text and simple pictures to coded representations of spatial relationships and, finally, to representation of operator actions. Our work provides an example of how mathematics instruction can be based on the use of email software to structure cooperative interactions among elementary aged students. For formative studies, we crafted materials of paper and poster board with varied examples at different levels of difficulty that could be used for multiple rounds of play. These materials were used throughout the research period in evaluations with three adults and twenty children in the first through fourth grades (ages 5-10 yrs.) from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. As the research progressed, the materials were revised or expanded in order to address issues that arose during the evaluation sessions. Some of the games were modified considerably after observing children play the games. Our research suggests that, taken together, the games improve the children’s facility with symbolic processing. In this paper we describe one of the KidCode games - Rebus - in detail. We explain how formative evaluation based on paper materials was used to test design ideas for the KidCode software and develop a sequence of games to scaffold children’s understanding of symbol systems and that would work effectively in an electronic mail context. The figure on the cover page shows the email inbox from a screen dump of a Macromedia Director1 prototype of the software. The bus icon indicates a Rebus game message.",Parallel Session Papers

When a worker runs into difficulty in carrying out a task, PHelpS provides a list of other workers who are ready, willing and able to help him or her. The worker then selects a particular helper with PHelpS supporting the subsequent help interaction. The PHelpS system acts as a facilitator to stimulate learning and collaboration, rather than as a directive agent imposing its perspectives on the workers.",Parallel Session Papers

Situated learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991) provides a theoretical basis for the model. According to this theory, learning is situated in activity, context, and culture. Through social interaction and collaboration, learners become engaged in a community of practice. This practice includes activities involving interaction with others, interaction with artifacts as representations of ideas (e.g., papers, projects, videos, concept maps), and interaction with artifacts which mediate communication and creation and manipulation of representations. In the context of online learning, computers mediate communication and manipulation of representational artifacts. This means that researchers and reflective practitioners have a unique opportunity to access the interactions of learners. For example, computer conferencing systems produce transcripts of the discourse which can then be evaluated. Criteria for evaluation of the online learning experience include critical thinking, collaboration, and knowledge building. For example, is there evidence of critical dialogic engagement? A central issue in each of these criteria is the process learners become engaged in as they produce representations of their understandings. Further, design of the learning activity shapes that process. Therefore, a requirement of the model is that it address instructional design, process, and outcomes. The goal of the model is to provide a means for synthesizing examination of the online learning experience from different perspectives. Two case studies are presented in which the model has been applied. One case involved a graduate course, the other an undergraduate course. The technology used to deliver the courses was Virtual-U, a web-based networked learning environment to support collaboration and knowledge building. We conclude with an assessment of some of the implications of the model and future modifications of the model.",Posters

Its case-authoring component, when used as part of the LBD curriculum, asks students to reflect on a recent Learning-by-Design experience, summarize it, and present important aspects of it and what they've learned from it for other students to learn from. By focusing on this part of the tool, we are able to both put our focus on supporting reflection and collect a library of student-authored cases that we will later edit and publish as exemplary cases for other students to use as models and to learn from. JavaCAP is meant to be used as a collaboration tool. Supporting collaboration in middle school requires supporting both group work around the computer (synchronous collaboration) and asynchronous editing of cases. We support asynchronous collaboration by allowing each student to write on the case and providing distinguishing formats for each so it is easy to see the changes made since last using the tool and identify whose changes they are. Our two studies suggest that JavaCAP does have potential as a collaborative reflection tool. We've used the metaphor of scenes in a play to help students remember different aspects of the experience they are analyzing and summarizing. Our first pilot showed that we had indeed found a way to engage students in effective reflection. However, this pilot also revealed flaws in the underlying technology. We needed to support asynchronous collaboration better than we were doing; the easiest way to do this was to reimplement using what the world wide web and its development tools had to offer. Our second pilot, using a revised tool both better supported asynchronous student authoring and made it easy for students to add images to their presentations. This study pointed out the need to better support writing itself within the framework we've created and suggests other collaboration features that students need.",Parallel Session Papers

This paper describes an experimental model of collaborative Web-teaching using netseminars to train teachers, who in turn, create NetCourses for their virtual students in a Virtual High School (VHS) Consortium. We suggest that netseminars and NetCourses represent a viable and feasible method for scaling up instruction that fosters constructivist teaching practices and capitalizes on collaborative learning communities and cooperative on-line resources. We articulate this novel model and discuss issues in fostering collaboration, highlighting the challenges faced by teachers and netfaculty in the transformation of their practices toward collaborative approaches based on results from the first netseminar.

Some difficulties are not having physical contact with our peers and knowing just from what they write as an audio/video complementation of telelearning is still a promise.

Our observations of groups involved in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenarios suggest a need to support two separate organizations of information. First is the conversation, a temporally-organized interaction which closely resembles unmoderated face-to-face interaction. Conversations place a value on speed, a sense of moving the conversation forward, relevant anecdotes, and a holistic assessment of the problem and serve as an appropriate forum for brainstorming, problem definition, socializing/synergy-building, and exploratory interactions. Lengthy focus on a specific issue, though, is difficult. Issuebased discussion takes place in conferences organized hierarchically (in an outline form).

It allows: (1) to display instructor’s pointer; (2) to display instructor’s face; (3) to display views of learner’s orientation; (4) to arouse learner’s awareness of being watched by the instructor; and (5) to dispose communication resources apart enough so as to clarify the learner’s orientation.

The study was aimed at analyzing how elementary school students’ process of inquiry mediated by the CSILE environment developed from first (third grade) to second (fourth grade) year of CSILE use. The study was carried out by analyzing qualitatively 26 students’ written productions in CSILE’s database as well as by conducting some structured interviews. The study indicated that the students made a considerable progress in terms of explanation-seeking research questions, explanatory level of knowledge produced by them as well as quality of discourse interaction. However, at this point of time there were no indications of in-depth knowledge advancement that characterize the most successful Canadian CSILE classes. It is argued that facilitation of higher-level practices of inquiry in the context of the CSCL require a lot of pedagogical and epistemological support for both the teachers and students. It seems also to be important to engage a whole school community to the process of pedagogical development rather than deal with individual teachers and classrooms.",Plenary Session Papers

Learning and cooperation in the Fifth Dimension are analyzed in the paper from the point of view of Activity Theory, a conceptual approach originating from Russian cultural-historical psychology. It is proposed that the mechanisms underlying the influence of social context on learning and development are mutual transformations between individual and collective activities. Three distinct phases of intersubjectivity ""life cycles"" are identified: (1) external coordination of individual activities, (2) emerging group identity, and (3) transfer of group experience to individual activities. Implications of the study for design and evaluation of CSCL environments are discussed.",Plenary Session Papers
