The value of a dialogic analytic framework including creative emergence was tested through applying it to the coding and analysis of undergraduate synchronous e-discussions using a graphical interface within the EU funded project ARGUNAUT. Qualitative analysis found that critical reasoning functioned to `deepen' the graph through unpacking assumptions whilst creative emergence of new perspectives produced `widening' moves. This distinction between deepening and widening was successfully used as the basis for an artificial intelligence (AI) graph-matching algorithm. Given examples of deepening and widening from real e-discussions, the AI algorithm was able to successfully find other occurrences of such moves within new e-discussions. This supports our claim to distinguish between these two aspects of shared thinking and has the potential to provide awareness indicators as a support for e-moderation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:04Z (GMT).

To investigate the learning outcome, we analyzed the joint task solutions with respect to knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. Learners were assigned to three groups who had to solve four tasks relating to the main topics on knowledge management. Results show that learning processes varied depending on the tasks and groups, but no general trend was found. Furthermore, the four task solutions also differed in their quality. The fact that learning processes were related to group products confirms the relevance of learning processes for acquiring and applying knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:07Z (GMT).

These prior analyses have focused on collaborative interaction, yet for instrumental purposes in educational practice, the individual is the unit of analysis. Hence it is relevant to ask how individuals use the products of collaborative interaction as documented in a given notational system. This paper reports on an analysis of data from a prior study to uncover how participants went about writing individual essays, drawing on the products of interactionally prior joint problem solving. The analysis first documented parameters of the human-computer interactions through which individual participants accessed and appropriated the record of prior work. Parameters included focus shifts, use of copy/paste, and access to records of data and hypotheses considered. The analysis then compared three experimental conditions and two post-hoc groups on the selected parameters. Profiles plots reveal consistent differences between the use of the notational systems that are indicative of differences in engagement with the materials.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:08Z (GMT).

We argue that the effectiveness of collaboration may depend on the type of knowledge the instruction targets: The interaction with a partner can slow down students and may thus decrease the amount of practice necessary for procedural skill fluency. On the other hand, collaboration could be particularly useful for conceptual knowledge acquisition, as here, the elaborative meaning- making activities ascribed to collaboration may facilitate learning. To evaluate the differential effects of collaborative learning, we compared four conditions: individual versus collaborative learning with procedural instruction, and individual versus collaborative learning with conceptual instruction. The study results support our hypotheses: Students who learned individually showed higher test scores in a procedural far transfer test. However, a combination test requiring both knowledge types revealed a positive impact of collaboration on students' conceptual knowledge acquisition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:09Z (GMT).

We trace the formation, transformation and refinement of one problem- solving practice--problem decomposition--and three representational practices--inscribe first solve second, modulate perspective and visualize decomposition. The analysis shows how inscriptions become representations for the group through a historical trajectory of negotiation. This result is of theoretical interest because it shows how the practices underlying group cognition are contingent upon not only the immediate situation but also the chronologically prior resources and associated practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:09Z (GMT).

Research on instruction suggests four interrelated processes that jointly lead to integrated understanding: eliciting current ideas, adding new ideas, evaluating ideas, and sorting out ideas. These processes characterize design patterns that promote knowledge integration. We describe how knowledge integration patterns informed the design of collaborative activities for Chemical Reactions and report on the value of heterogeneity in small groups. We describe how teachers learned from each other while refining an on-line teacher's guide for Asthma.

We propose a new framework - the collaborative scientific conceptual change model to stresses the importance of high quality collaborative discourse and scientific epistemic practices in the process of conceptual change. To investigate how group interactions influence individual students' learning gains, multilevel analysis was used to analyze the hierarchically nested data and qualitative analyses were presented to compare high and low-achievement groups' discourse and their application of epistemic practices. The results found that predicting and coordinating theory and evidence were key practices that predicted students' individual posttest performance and the group interactions were related to the group understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:09Z (GMT).

A design-oriented method was employed, where the first iteration of the curriculum was evaluated in terms of its fit to the model, as well as its impact on student learning. Based on a set of design recommendations, a much more substantive curriculum was developed for the second iteration, leading to rich measures of student collaboration and deep understanding of the targeted science concepts.

It suggests that broad brush approaches to generational changes obscure the subtle but important differences between students. It also suggests that claims that there has been a step change in attitudes takes attention away from the kinds of choices that might be necessary in relation to variations that are indeed taking place amongst new cohorts of students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:11Z (GMT).

The technological tool was developed to enhance dialogism and argumentation, in one Grade 9 class. The question we focused on concerns whether the technological tool used by each teacher for a specific subject matter became integrated in teaching and learning practice across disciplines. Data included 22 discussion maps in five activities by different teachers. The analysis focuses on two dimensions of use of the technological tool: its form and its function. The findings show a process of appropriation of the technological tool could be detected along the five activities. This appropriation could be seen through the increase of arguments and challenges, the growing reference to each other's ideas, and capitalization of previous arguments in follow-up arguments. The results of this study stress the importance of the participation of teachers in the same teacher training and shows that appropriation of norms afforded by a tool are instigated by their participation in two activity systems stimulated by the same technological tool.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:12Z (GMT).

The increased financial burden for these institutions and the enhanced task burden for teachers working with small groups of students threaten the quality of teaching and learning. In order to cope with this situation, computer-mediated collaboration (telecollaboration) was used to provide teachers with the opportunity to work with colleagues from other colleges who teach similar courses. In this short paper, the impacts of telecollaboration on resources diversity and teacher professional development are examined. After four semesters of experimentation, questionnaires and interviews suggest that teachers learned from their colleagues as they shared ideas and acquired pedagogical and technopedagogical knowledge and skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:12Z (GMT).

We have used the complex systems concept of adaptation as a lens for understanding how and why some teachers are better able to adapt to the educational program requirements. The results show that processes of convergence and non-convergence influenced adaptive outcomes, and that the more similar the teaching characteristic index (TCI) number was between group members, the more likely it was that group dynamics would result in convergent adaptive outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:13Z (GMT).

In our research, we have explored and contrasted two different models: MODEL-AUTHORITATIVE (based on strong input filters, relatively small information repositories, and weak output filters) and MODEL-DEMOCRATIC (based on weak input filters, large and diverse information repositories, and strong output filters to find relevant and reliable information). We postulate that MODEL-DEMOCRATIC democratizes design, requires support for meta-design, and fosters social creativity thereby creating new challenges and opportunities for computer-supported collaborative learning.

If such a formal organization supports a community, does the balance between informal and formal structures will change? This short paper presents the results of a field study about a socio-technical community called `InPUD' which is part of a faculty. The main conclusion is that a specific degree of digital formalization in online groups is needed for successful online structures and sustainability.

It is maintained that typical functionalities in existing educational web- technologies, such as various Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), are quite inflexible and inadequate for shared work on epistemic objects.

The personal devices that are applied in a manner without interoperation with appropriate peripherals may interfere with face-to-face collaboration since the personal devices were design for personal usages. To improve the collaboration that takes place in small face-to-face groups in repeated episodes, we seek to strengthen relationships by encouraging non-verbal contact, which is known to be a key component to increasing intimacy in personal relationships. Through gathering the small group learning interactions in a collaborative learning scenario, this study proposed that classroom environments require, in addition to personal devices, special design of boundary objects to sustain and support social learning activities. An experimental classroom was developed with LCD displays and shared- display groupware. Analysis of student learning activity found that students working with only personal devices tended to learn together in a disjoint interaction pattern. Contrarily, in the environment with shared-displays as boundary objects students demonstrated a joint and coherent interaction pattern since they took more notice of the shared group work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:16Z (GMT).

Analysis suggests that the environment can support various collaborative activities, but of central interest, demonstrated the role of peer interference in learning activities. Verbal negotiation and synchronization of actions emerged as conflict-resolution strategies and an implicit agreement by the children for sharing the physical and virtual resources of the system was noticed. The physicality and `present at hand' nature of the input devices contributed to balanced levels of participation, particularly through action. Overall, the interference-prone tabletop environment contributed to creating a highly collaborative environment in which individual exploration was discouraged, leading the group through a productive process of collective exploration and knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:16Z (GMT).

In the single-touch condition, the tabletop surface allowed only one child to interact with the digital content at a time. In the multiple-touch condition, the children could interact with the digital content simultaneously. Results showed that touch condition did not affect the frequency or equity of interactions, but did influence the nature of children's discussion. In the multiple-touch condition, children talked more about the task; in the single- touch condition, they talked more about turn taking. We also report age and gender differences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:17Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We take the perspective of identifying the characteristics of interactional moves as students interact and negotiate meaning in the computer-mediated collaborative learning (CSCL) environment called GroupScribbles (GS). Much work in group cognition and in interactional analysis of small groups looks at problem-solving in subjects like mathematics and science. In language learning, the task posed for collaborative activities does not focus on problem- solving, but it may be targeted towards enriching students' vocabulary and proficiency in language expression, developing their thoughts and writing through cogitating with new words, vocabulary and sentence construction. We hope the work can illuminate how students can co-construct knowledge mediated by GS representations for Chinese language learning. In the paper, we look at collaborative situations in which the group members are not seated together in the classroom, and so they have to collaborate through the GS medium.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:17Z (GMT).

Unfortunately, dominance behavior often naturally emerges in these situations, when one child monopolizes the mouse and keyboard. One way to mitigate this phenomenon is by providing each child with a mouse and a corresponding on- screen cursor so that everyone can interact. Though such multiple-mouse configurations reduce the possibility of total domination by one individual, they do not automatically eliminate dominance behavior completely. We propose the use of a design for small-group learning on shared computers based on enforced turn-taking in a split-screen, multiple-mouse environment. In an evaluation with 104 rural schoolchildren in India, we found that dominance behavior was indeed reduced through these design choices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:17Z (GMT).

As expected, when groups used the ""complex"" O-UI, there was less visitor-visitor interaction, but unexpectedly, their conversations were of higher quality. They also engaged in better task division and displayed better task performance. The increased attention ""simple"" O-UI users were able to devote to monitoring one another's actions seemed to encourage emergent competitive behaviors, which disproportionately affected the engagement of female visitors.

Students visit these forums seeking help on specific queries from coursework and receive help from anonymous others. In contrast to help forums designed and supervised by educational researchers, these forums have a grassroots origin. This paper investigates one such calculus help forum for evidence that forum tutors are scaffolding students to contribute to the successful solution of the exercise they posted. An analysis of 200 exchanges on limit and related rates revealed the presence of effective guided problem solving (marked by leading questions and hints), albeit to a limited extent. This work points to the need for discovering ways to augment constructive interactions in popular help forums that have become part of the student learning experience.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:20Z (GMT).

This knowledge-exchange situation represented a social dilemma: while contributing information to a shared database led to costs and provided no immediate benefit to the individual, the entire group suffered when all members decided to withhold information. A series of experiments identified a multitude of influencing factors in this situation: group size, awareness of the importance of information, costs of entering information, use-related bonus systems, feedback and recommendations, and group awareness. This paper describes the impact of these factors on people's willingness to share their knowledge with their cooperators, and concludes with a discussion of some practical consequences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:21Z (GMT).

This model assumes that knowledge progress emerges from cognitive conflicts that result from incongruities between an individual's prior knowledge and the information which is contained in a shared digital artifact. This paper will provide empirical support for the model by applying it to Wikipedia articles and by examining knowledge-building processes using network analyses.

Based on the analysis, two distinct learner profiles that reflect differences in the students' dependencies can be distinguished: monitor and reflector. Furthermore, an indirect dependencies found in the analysis suggests that both reflectors and monitors are also active wiki editors and participants in face-to-face discussions. Further qualitative analyses are needed in order to get an in-depth view of the complex interactions and dependencies within and between the face-to-face and virtual, but also individual and social, planes of collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:22Z (GMT).

An adaptation pattern is described as a well-defined adaptation process that can be initiated by the system when specific conditions are identified during script implementation. In order to model the proposed method twelve postgraduate students were engaged in a pyramid-type collaboration script and the analysis of the learning experience provided the basis for identifying a number of possible adaptation patterns.

This form of interaction and learning in small online groups of students presents novel challenges, both for the participating students and for researchers studying their work. Chats differ from talk-in-interaction since the composition, posting and visual inspection of text and graphical objects by any given actor is not observable by the other participants. These structural constraints on the organization of interaction require that actors deploy alternative procedures for achieving what turn taking achieves in talk-in-interaction. This paper describes how communication is organized in text chat, where postings have to provide instructions on how they are to be read. This organization is contrasted with turn taking in face-to-face communication.

WikiPlus helps enhancing the collaboration process by enabling the teacher to adapt the script whenever non predicted learner's activities happen.

Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in the learning outcomes of the two groups.

We describe here a study in which we trained students-teachers to moderate synchronous discussions and asked them to moderate discussions in two different ways of guidance, social and argumentation guidance. We show that moderation of synchronous discussions is feasible as effects of moderation on argumentative, social and interactive aspects of the discussion reflect the kind of guidance suggested.

However, assessment design has also been recognized as a demanding task for non-expert instructional designers or practitioners. To tackle this problem, the use of learning and assessment patterns has already been reported as a way of supporting script design for non-experts. In this context, the combination of patterns of different nature (learning-oriented and assessment-oriented) can be regarded as an essential task of CSCL script design. This paper discusses how to support this task, focusing on the joint application of patterns, and describes an evaluation of the proposed approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:24Z (GMT).

A computer-supported environment offers several possibilities to handle the specific demands of this target group, for example, by structuring the learning situation with Floor Control. Floor Control explicitly structures the activities in the learning environment and implicitly enhances communication. To examine whether the Floor Control supports the collaboration process on activity level as well as on communication level or not, two versions of a CSCL environment were realized and compared with each other. The results revealed an improved task-related communication and a higher quality of learning results.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In groups, 47 secondary education students worked on a complex business-economics problem in four experimental conditions, namely one where groups received task-congruent representations for all stages and three where they received one of the representations for all three phases (task-incongruent).

An experimental study was conducted to evaluate this hypothesis. The study design consisted of three independent groups of dyads from similar or different cultures (American-American, American-Chinese, and Chinese-Chinese) doing collaborative problem- solving in a knowledge-mapping learning environment. Participants interacted through an asynchronous computer interface providing multiple tools for interaction (diagrammatic workspace, embedded notes, threaded discussion). Based on empirical findings documenting cross-cultural variations in communication and cognition, several research hypotheses were advanced. Statistical results show that members of different cultures appropriated the resources of the interface differently in their interaction, and formed differential relations with and impressions of each other. However, analyses of the individually written essays show no statistically significant differences in learning outcomes. Implications for CSCL are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We investigated the viability of these ideas using data collected in a classroom evaluation of an ACLS system for peer tutoring which incorporated the design ideas in a manner that provided cognitive support to peer tutors. In this paper, we discuss how students interacted with the different forms of feedback, and propose a second iteration of the assistance that involves collaborative support in addition to domain support.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:26Z (GMT).

The notion of person-object relations (PORs) is introduced as the basic building block underlying both group awareness and social navigation. Four design principles of SCAN tools (response formatting, juxtaposition, aggregation/transformation, and prediction/recommendation) are discussed, and their application in CSCL scenarios is described. Finally, issues for both practical implications and use-inspired basic research on SCAN mechanisms will be explored.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The underlying assumption was that group functioning can be positively influenced by making group members aware of how their behavior is perceived by themselves, their peers, and the group as a whole. This awareness, which is conditional for behavioral change, is achieved through a peer assessment tool and a reflection tool. A 2x2 factorial between- subjects design was used. Participants were 39 fourth-year high school students who worked in groups of 3 or 4 on a collaborative writing task. Results show that groups with peer assessment tool developed better teams, had lower levels of group conflicts, and had a more positive attitude towards collaborative problem solving, than groups without a peer assessment tool. Thus, peer feedback on social behavior of group members can enhance group functioning in CSCL-groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Aiming to understand and enhance time awareness in distance learning context we introduced a methodology for the assessment of Group Time Awareness, based on the comparison of subjective and inter-subjective students' learning time perceptions. Assuming that enhancing awareness will help the collaborative learning process (McCarthy and Garavan, 2008) we hypothesize that group awareness could be improved by enhancing the reflexive properties of the Computer Learning Environment. For this purpose, we conducted an experimental study introducing a context-awareness tool in order to evaluate its impact on group time awareness scores.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:30Z (GMT).

Following a within subject design, our cases were two teachers who were asked to moderate discussions of their students and to choose and prepare a discussion topic compliant with the curriculum. Results indicate that additional awareness support was deliberately used during moderation when available. An analysis of data from the teachers' answers to 120 questions and tasks indicates that in the awareness condition, both teachers performed better on the tasks as compared to moderating without awareness support. However, it could not be corroborated that teachers gained additional knowledge about the discussion solely from using the awareness support in absence of an external task.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:30Z (GMT).

The recursive, bottom-up writing process requires the pupils to collaboratively carry out ""word/phrase pooling"", ""sentence making"", ""paragraph writing"" and ""outlining"" on wiki, and eventually composing their essays individually. The intention is to fill up the gap between the current-traditional product-oriented approach and the more cognitively demanding process- oriented approach, that is, juvenile L2 learners' limited linguistic and cognitive skills that would hinder them from writing proper essays, not to mention carrying out process writing. The results of our pilot study show that the target pupils' micro-skills for writing were improved significantly due to emergent peer coaching. There is also an implication that through such peer coaching activities, the perceived challenge of pupils' individual differences in linguistic proficiency could be turned into an advantage for motivating pupils' collaboration in learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:31Z (GMT).

The paper explains the use of this notion and clarifies theoretical backgrounds for the approach in line with the knowledge creation metaphor of learning, and relates it especially to knowledge building and socio-cultural and cultural- historical theories of human cognition. Various theories concerning mediation are briefly analyzed. The paper also explains how dialogues and trialogues are close to each other if, for example, the role of common ground is analyzed further.

We describe a project (ARISE: Augmented Reality in School Environments) that aims to realise this potential by developing a collaborative, robust and affordable Augmented Reality learning platform for schools. The learning affordances of Augmented Reality are discussed, and an educational application is described that supports remote collaboration between students in a shared 3D workspace, where students from different countries present, discuss and manipulate virtual objects relating to their local culture. The evaluation of the application is based on a distributed summer school project involving students from two European countries. In addition to more conventional evaluation approaches, special requirements for evaluating remote collaboration in a shared Augmented Reality workspace have been met with a customised approach involving synchronised video observations in both locations with subsequent editing of the material into and a single screen giving a comprehensive overview of the collaboration from both ends. The results of the evaluation study are currently being analysed, but preliminary findings suggest that the Augmented Reality learning platform has been well received by students and teachers, and is well suited for remote collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:08Z (GMT).

The purpose of the study was to investigate how the technology under investigation Knowledge Practices Environment (KPE) facilitates working collaboratively with shared knowledge objects. It appears that students used KPE mostly for managing and sharing project documentation; and that task was usually delegated to one team member. Students found that organizing items in the content view helped them to get an overview of the tasks, knowledge objects and their interrelationships. On the other hand, the flexibility of the KPE, especially the possibility for all team members to edit and change anything openly might also be a challenge; it requires systematic organization of materials. More research is needed before KPE's potentials and pitfalls in shared knowledge advancement can be reliably assessed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:11Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The theoretical description is accompanied by four papers applying this framework to examine the collaborative practices in different collaborative settings online gamers, adolescent musicians, middleschool technology projects, and a comparative study of Quakers and product designers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:17Z (GMT).

Our method traces contingent relationships between events at two granularities. We begin with an event in which the group is applying shared practices for the class of mathematical problems under consideration. In this event, participants construed certain inscriptions as representational resources for resolving the question at hand. We then search backwards to find chronologically prior episodes in which these and related inscriptions are constructed, resulting in a sequence of episodes through which the representational practices were developed. We then work forwards within each episode to construct an account of how the inscriptions become representations through the negotiated practices of participants, using methods similar to conversation analysis but attending to inscriptional acts as well as conversations in the chat tool. The resulting account shows not only how practices are negotiated locally, but also how prior work is re-invoked with the aid of persistent inscriptions. Intersubjective meaning-making takes place in interaction, but not in a vacuum: it draws on the history and resources of the group.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:17Z (GMT).

At the center of this issue lies an assistance dilemma: when to provide support structures and when to withhold them (at least temporarily) to optimize student learning. On the one hand, providing support structures right from the start has the advantage of reducing cognitive load, avoiding floundering and potential frustration. It may well lead to productive success, but there is also the danger of unproductive success--an illusion of performance without learning. On the other hand, withholding support may well lead to productive failure as students persist in active sense-making and problem-solving activities, but there is the danger of unproductive failure in students being overwhelmed. This symposium aims to interrogate issues pertinent to the assistance dilemma continuum by bringing together an eclectic group of CSCL researchers with commitments on various points on the continuum.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:18Z (GMT).

By combining traditional qualitative methods with statistical modeling, we are afforded a better opportunity to see aspects of a phenomenon, but not always greater integration; interpretation does not easily emerge from potentially divergent data sets. By including social network analysis, which provides both summary statistics and graphical depiction of interaction we are afforded a better opportunity to examine collaborative work. Furthermore, technology facilitates collection and analysis of change over time in computer supported collaborative work. These methods enable a multifarious view of quantitative data, and allow for interpretation to more naturally emerge from multiple data sets.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:18Z (GMT).

This poster presentation contributes to earlier studies on professional vision and disciplined perception in that it emphasizes the role of feedback, power relations, and ontogeny that shape collaborative interpretation of what is seen on the screen. Taking an analytical perspective founded in ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, this study will closely examine participants of a medical training in PET reading to be held in a Finnish university hospital in spring 2009. Video-recorded data will be analyzed using discourse analytical methods with a focus in understanding the appropriation of professional concepts and analytical skills in relation to feedback, ontogeny, and power.

The increase of users for ten years indicates that this exchange medium can be an instrument for professional development. But, many discussion lists are managed by the ministry of education, and one can wonder if such lists are open spaces for all kinds of sharing or kinds of institutional disciplinary showcase. We studied all the messages, during three consecutive years, of a specific discussion list for management secondary teacher (named IGC 2752 messages) and an extract of a private list for librarian teachers (named CDIDOC 935 messages) and adopted an ad hoc coding process (with a triple dimension) to get an in-depth view of the nature of exchanges and an understanding of list regulation.

This leads to weaker support networks, lower self confidence and lesser access to mentors. We investigate whether a community built with a specific purpose to allow women in science and engineering to share personal stories can support women to reflect and learn from each other's experience. This paper presents the design of WISETales, a new online community for sharing personal stories. It discusses the design and the potential role of the community as an informal learning tool based on results of an exploratory user study.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:22Z (GMT).
