We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare students who practiced problems based on a single template to students who practiced problems based on multiple templates within the same intelligent tutoring system. No conclusive evidence was found for differences in the two conditions on students’ post-test performance and hint request behavior.

Much of it framed technically around data harvested from digital tools and presentation mechanisms called dashboards.  Using a specific case involving a collaborative game-based education research project, this paper provides a broad, sociotechnical design perspective through three frame expanding sections: the educational game’s learning theory-driven approach, the information architecture of the learning analytics system, and the activity system that the information from learning analytics information are used within.  This paper illustrates a portion of the conceptual landscape that can guide the design, development, and research for these data systems that are potentially consequential for students and educators.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:56Z (GMT).

Clinical interviews demonstrated that students do use knowledge of equations to dynamically assemble an intuitive but productive understanding of physical quantities. Moreover, student reasoning stabilized around the equation. Think-aloud protocols illustrated that using a multi-representational learning technology (NetLogo) to problematize students’ reasoning de-stabilized their knowledge to shift them towards constructing the productive understanding and conferred a learning benefit on a multi-representational assessment.

And how can qualitative researchers address these critiques? In response, we begin by drawing parallels between experimental music literature and posthuman education scholarship, arguing that SMN limits the scope of qualitative inquiry and reinscribes the problematically humanist aims of education research. We then propose the use of graphic scores as a means to explore how sound and other non-anthropocentric bodies contribute to the construction of meaning within learning environments. To exemplify this approach, we conclude by providing two graphic score transcriptions of video data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

For SMM, visitors are invited to recount their experience in a museum room verbally and visually by marking it on an illustrated floor plan displayed on the tablet along with digital paint tools. The app records both visitors’ talk and their markings. This paper discusses SMM and its methodological contribution to exploring aspects of the museum experience by drawing upon data from a collaborative study at the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. The findings suggest that SMM enables researchers to capture aspects of visitors’ previous experience and knowledge which become relevant in interaction with the physical and social context of their visit.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:58Z (GMT).

In this paper, we report on the second iteration of a design-based research project to understand and support estimation problem solving among engineering undergraduates. We designed a software environment with several resources and scaffolds for solving estimation problems. By analyzing student actions as they solve an estimation problem in this environment, we identified the problem-solving processes that lead to good estimation performance.

Yet, the nature of such struggle is uncomfortable in the moment and often avoided for some students. This study aims to interrogate the phenomenon of learning through a lens of perseverance by investigating the effect of scaffolding mathematics tasks on students’ perseverance process during problem-solving. The findings illustrate that prompting students to conceptualize a mathematical situation prior to problem-solving can encourage re-initiating and re-sustaining mathematically productive effort upon reaching a perceived impasse, despite reported discomfort. These results suggest specific methods by which in-the-moment perseverance, and thus learning mathematics with understanding, can be supported.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:58Z (GMT).

We report on a polyvocal design-based research study in which an activity course instructors designed to support building connections across theory, task, and design became particularly salient for students in two graduate courses (design-based research and advanced learning design). In both courses, students came to express more ownership over theory and saw theory not as inert, but as a tool they could wield and revise. This learning design thus supported students to take a design approach to theorywork.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This research study seeks to provide interpretable insights with machine learning technologies for multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) by introducing two different explanatory machine learning-based models (neural network and Bayesian network) in different manners (end-to-end learning and probabilistic analysis) and for the same goal - provide explainable and actionable feedback.

More recent approaches have started to examine narratives, positionings and critical engagement in a field that historically has marginalized large groups of people, especially women and students of color. In this paper, we chart and review this “identity turn” in CS education by drawing on metaphors developed in STEM and literacy studies to review how identity has been framed and researched.

A quantitative analysis using choice-based conjoint analysis (N = 104) showed that the visualization of friendliness is weighted higher than participation in wiki groups. GA assessments are moreover slightly related to personal characteristics like the learning motivation, the tendency towards social comparisons, and the need for affect. The additional qualitative analysis (N = 19) revealed a higher effect of visualized emotional deficits on perceived group problems than cognitive and behavioral deficits, underlining the need for a stronger investigation and support of emotional GA.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:01Z (GMT).

This study looks at five perspectives students could assume which were identified by the course instructor as goals of the course: the perspective of a historian, a person responding to events, a political leader, a city-state citizen, a Greek at the time. The last three of these were identified as important historical practices that are difficult to teach in a lecture-focused classroom environment.

In this paper, we present the findings of a large-scale survey (n=1,261) on informal science learning. The results show that gender and social background influence youths’ attitudes toward science as well as their engagement with informal learning. The paper concludes with a design proposal for an engagement tracker enabling young learners’ self-reflection and participation in designing their learning activities. Both elements, self-reflection and participation are meant to encourage science learning and diminish the gap between learners from diverse backgrounds.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:02Z (GMT).

It happens at both group and individual levels where collaborative learning is constructed by individual members with the use of mediational means but cannot be reduced by the summation of individual contributions. Collaboration agency is a property that also belongs to both individual members and the whole group, which can be empirically examined through the place making practice and mediational means. Through the analysis of a case episode, we presented the complexity of one group’s collaborative problem-solving effort and evidenced the criticality of analyzing place making practice and mediational means. This analysis helps expand our view of agency in classroom beyond the dilemma resulted from a felt need to control, or the power relations, and further bears implications for learning design practitioners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:03Z (GMT).

In resolving this productive tension between systematically describing debugging and recognizing its broad reach, we argue researchers should attend to rich descriptions of situated debugging, especially among beginning debuggers. We present data from a week-long, free summer camp, Code Your Art, that engaged middle-school students in creating expressive computational visual effects. Here we find that students’ responses to debugging tasks varied sharply across tasks. We argue that debugging work emerges in interaction with features of the environment, and we discuss design refinements we have made to pursue and study this conjecture.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:03Z (GMT).

In this paper we present the creation of a domain-specific modeling experience with a “custom block” visual programming language for an agent-based modeling environment for high school biology students. We found that with refined language, which maintained the metaphors and the abstractions vital to the science concepts being taught, students were able to complete a computational model without having been taught how to code. We also found preliminary evidence of students being able to learn science through building a computational model composed of customized code blocks.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:04Z (GMT).

We analyze how the props complement and extend embodied activity as participants collectively organize, model, and discuss how water particles move during state changes. Students in a combined 1st and 2nd grade classroom (n=22) participated in a seven-day Science through Technology Enhanced Play (STEP) curriculum. We apply interaction analysis to offer a close look at how the students take up props in ways that complement their current embodied understanding of particles and extend their sensemaking to support new conceptual understandings. Findings demonstrate the potential of props as supplemental tools to support student sensemaking around challenging science concepts within MR environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:05Z (GMT).

The types of interactions under each dimension were correlated with the groups’ progress on the task. Findings indicated that groups were partially engaged in high quality interactions despite the fact that the task and the technology were designed to promote the types of interactions that positively impact the group processes. Higher group progress scores were associated with more engagement in causal elaborated statements and metacognitive turns. This can inform the design of tasks, technological tools, and instructional models that are used in collaborative problem solving STEM classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:05Z (GMT).

To accurately calibrate, an accurate understanding of the assessment criteria plays an important role, and reflective activities in groups on self-assessment could provide opportunities for learners to take time thinking about their performance and correcting each other’s understanding of the criteria. This study aims to examine the relationship between learner calibration, at the group and individual level, with their patterns of discourse in the self-reflective discussions that indicated learner understanding of the assessed items. Results show that high calibration accuracy groups had more accurate understanding of the items, while incorrect understanding in medium and low calibration accuracy groups were either ignored or agreed upon, rather than challenged.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:06Z (GMT).

It was found that a message that either expressed a disagreement, a correct idea or a wrong idea or asked a question was more likely to receive a response. Time was another significant predictor of a message’s responsiveness, in that messages posted earlier in a discussion or users that responded more promptly were more likely to receive a response.

Informed by perspectives on embodied interaction and meaning making, interaction analysis methods were applied to video data of pairs of visitors as they took turns exploring and guiding each other through the experience. Findings suggest that in situations where gaze and gesture cannot be relied on, visitors develop creative means to develop shared understandings.

Ten primary students took part in an after-school intervention in an inner-city primary school in the midlands of England. Tasks focused on algorithm design, program execution and loops for programming, and representation choice, and structural and visual design for storytelling. Our results demonstrate how a non-STEM context supported the process of integrated programming and storytelling in meaningful ways.

We used sociocultural discourse analysis and association analysis to identify learners and useful resources, then qualitatively examined how learners related to the intended learning goals of the program (i.e., Knowledge/Curriculum) based on characteristics of their museum visit (i.e., Environment/Organization). As expected from prior research, parents and children acted as learners and resources.

In education, both learning and assessing CPS competency are imperatives. However, research related to CPS assessment has not been a mainstream topic in educational measurement, though there are international efforts like PISA and ATC21S initiatives, and a few assessment methodologies have been proposed. This study is an in-depth investigation to compare students’ CPS performance in a closed-ended technology-mediated and an open-ended authentic task setting. Differences in assessment results were observed, which has important implications for the design of learning and/or assessment in CPS. In the extant literature, large-scale CPS assessments deploy tightly framed, technology-mediated tasks, while CSCL research studies learning in authentic contexts. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how task contexts influence CPS behavior.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:09Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The goal was to create activities where the mathematics served as context to employ CT strategies and the CT helped deepen mathematics engagement. Here, we present two vignettes from this work. One shows what mutually-supportive CT and mathematics can look like in a fourth-grade classroom, and a second illustrates how both CT and mathematics can be present but not mutually supportive.

Thirty-one Grade 9 students studying in Art and Design participated in the study using Knowledge Forum® (KF), a multi-media collaborative inquiry workspace. A key design involved the integration of online KF discourse and classroom discourse in the form of meta-reflection talk - knowledge building principles were embedded in classroom dialogue to support idea development and rise-above dialogue. Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer (KBDeX), a social network analysis tool, was used to track students’ changing collective responsibility over time. Classroom dialogue analyses identified dialogic moves into three areas including articulation and elaboration, build-on and connect, and collective reflection and idea development. Analyses illuminated how students engaged in collective meta-reflection and progressive dialogue. Implications of enriching classroom dialogue using knowledge-building perspectives involving meta-reflection and progressive dialogue are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:11Z (GMT).

This symposium brings together members of five research teams to reflect on the NRC criteria using examples of three-dimensional assessments. Through a collective analysis of these teams’ current design approaches, we identified six emergent criteria for three-dimensional assessment design that promote equity: (1) assessments are based on a relevant phenomenon or scenario, (2) explicitly attend to language, (3) include scaffolds to make expectations explicit for students, (4) attend to the identities of learners, (5) engage and support student sensemaking, and (6) are accompanied by tools and routines to support teacher design and enactment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:13Z (GMT).

Despite the importance of play across the lifespan, mathematics classrooms are often spaces students feel a void of agency and enjoyment. This has strong implications for students’ sense of competence and their identities as individuals who participate in and enjoy mathematics. Thus, designing playful environments where children enjoy and participate in mathematics as a form of meaning making is a critical issue for equity in education.  By putting these four studies in conversation with one another, we hope to develop a refined understanding of how particular design decisions influence learner engagement in mathematics, with an eye towards making mathematical play more accessible both in and out of school.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:13Z (GMT).

In contrast to schools or school-adjacent spaces, museum spaces are often designed to elicit various forms of learning–including affective, embodied, cultural forms–through a variety of pathways for participation from the individuated to the collaborative. However, these design intentions around learning and participation are not always legible to a racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse group of visitors, many of whom may only visit the museum as part of a school or “formal” educational activity or on limited occasions. This runs up against the design imperatives of museums that often foreground experiences which assume visitors know or feel welcome to engage in the supported forms of participation – including traditional modes of science inquiry and/or collaboration. More recently, there has been a move across museum studies, educational research, and the learning sciences to include the kinds of experiences that many learners find more inclusive of a broader range of prior knowledges and ways of knowing and doing: including games, toys, play, and theatre. In this symposium, we will explore different ways that recent research has been reframing museum experiences towards a more inclusive focus that scaffolds complex learning, joy, and play and may have implications for learning and identity. As such, we bring together scholars who are exploring new ways to design for, study, and engage museum visitors to respect different ways of knowing, different perspectives, and different backgrounds.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:14Z (GMT).

We often talk about learning through collaboration; we rarely talk about collaboration itself as learning. Talking about collaboration as learning shifts our focus on acknowledging diverse collaborative arrangements and on the design of the learning space, activities and tools that afford opportunities for the same. Instead of viewing collaborations as a byproduct of attaining a separate outcome, valuing certain collaborative behaviors as “productive”; considering collaboration as a learning outcome allows us to recognize diversity within collaborative styles and values brought into learning spaces, and their affordances and constraints for different activities. In this symposium, we bring together different ways of collaborating, as the object to design for and learn in an environment. Synthesizing these diverse bodies of work under the umbrella of learned collaboration, enables us to identify types and patterns of collaboration, which in turn, can allow us to actively support students to ""learn to collaborate; as well as broaden perspectives of recognizing different behaviors as productive collaboration (which are often overlooked due to their lack of explicit service to other learning goals).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:14Z (GMT).

In recent years, libraries have become prominent places for designing and facilitating hands-on learning experiences. As these experiences and programs increase, there has emerged a need for assessment to communicate impacts to various stakeholders and provide useful information to practitioners to make ongoing improvements. This session brings together researchers and practitioners from four projects that are designing and using assessments within libraries. These projects highlight different tools, practices, purposes and foci for assessment. Through this session, participants will become aware of these projects, engage with the tools themselves and consider the theoretical and practical implications for the different approaches.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:14Z (GMT).

These challenges invite deeper explorations of how to leverage the affordances of online environments to design experiences that further support teacher learning. In this symposium we bring together a group of projects that engage teacher learning across subject areas and domains, and that represent a range of program formats—from MOOCs to instructional coaching models to professional learning communities. We will first discuss the rationale and outcomes of the specific design features built into each of the projects, and then draw implications for online teacher learning and professional development that cut across these projects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:15Z (GMT).

Our field has had much to say about data, information, and knowledge. Yet the notion and utility of wisdom has yet to be thoroughly explored. As our field collectively turns our commitments from generating knowledge about learning to knowledgeably enacting change through learning, we have to rely on wisdom to ensure our research endeavors act on problems that matter toward more just, caring, and loving futures for all learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:15Z (GMT).

Across two design research cycles in high school science classrooms, we analyze episodes of student activity to understand how practices of computational tinkering might translate from informal settings to formal science classrooms to enable learners to engage in practices that reflect authentic scientific work, draw upon learner experiences, and support more equitable participation in science. Looking across both student-centered and curricula-centered science classrooms for emergent goals, rapid iteration, and noticing and reflection, we saw computational tinkering take shape during moments of play, troubleshooting and tuning, and sharing. We discuss findings and implications for practice in relation to professional science practice and goals of science education in an era of computational ascendancy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:15Z (GMT).

We found the learning environment supported students to choose political issues, form teams, and scope detailed project proposals from scratch, by completing iterations of proposing ideas, raising questions, suggesting improvements, planning to-dos, seeking information, and updating their proposals. This study contributes DBL, a novel, empirically grounded model of learning environments for scoping design projects through deliberation, which can be further refined through multi-case studies across contexts. By understanding DBL, learning scientists can engage students in political organizing in their communities—a key to sustaining democracy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:16Z (GMT).

To evaluate the impact of these supports for learning, we surveyed over 11,000 educators who used the product in their classrooms. Using quantitative and qualitative feedback, we found that teachers were enthusiastic about the features, reporting that they supported a variety of learners. However, many teachers were unaware that these features were available. Importantly, we shared these results with the literacy platform, to further inform its development.

One area that is receiving growing attention is whether drawing is of value when students work with multi-representational simulations. In this paper, we report on a design-based research (DBR) project to teach intermediate-level undergraduate quantum mechanics (QM) through drawing and simulations. We articulate six distinct pedagogical roles of drawing, principles for task design and success criteria for drawing both prior to and whilst working with the simulations. This approach has been iteratively improved through three annual cycles of implementation in two universities in two different countries. Our findings illustrate a variety of theory-informed reasons to draw to learn in science and consider what scaffolding is required to help students make the best use of such an approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:18Z (GMT).

The visual analytics were based on self and peer ratings of a domain-general, four-dimensional teamwork competency measure. To evaluate the intervention, a quasi-experiment using embedded mixed methods design was carried out with 452 Grade 8 students and 26 teachers. Findings suggest that the design principles enacted were instrumental for helping students learn and reflect more about their teamwork competency. It also improved their team behaviors in a targeted manner.

Surveying emerging literature in this area, this paper outlines three key considerations for learning scientists seeking to address issues of equity when studying, designing, and implementing technology-rich environments. These issues, taking new forms across technologies and digital media, we identify as: the Neutrality Facade, the “New” Digital Divide, and the Openness Paradox. Finally, the paper offers three directions for addressing power issues in learning environments mediated by educational technology and digital media: critical design methods, critical digital pedagogy, and critical design literacies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:21Z (GMT).

Further, that the limbs of undesirability extended past the classroom to render her class of racially minoritized students undesirable within a de facto racially tracked math program; and, her school as undesirable for its predominantly racially minoritized student population.  Using Positioning Theory in ways novel to the learning sciences, and in drawing on data collected over an academic year (fieldnotes, interviews, surveys), this analysis lays bare how undesirability is both a requirement of neoliberal mathematics learning and an emergent position for someone or something to occupy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:21Z (GMT).

We performed a content analysis to identify key assessment practices. The majority (20) included a focus on performance of the design, and a substantial number included a focus on communication (15) and scoping (11).

In the plan condition, students plan an experiment with a model by graphing the level of a system parameter (e.g., concentration of greenhouse gases) and the predicted response of an outcome variable (e.g., temperature). They then run the model to observe the accuracy of their predictions. In the typical condition, students run the simulation immediately and adjust the parameter level as they see fit. Students produced more informative experiments in the plan condition than the typical condition. Students in the plan condition made inferences by comparing their prediction to the outcome.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Yet whereas all students have the capacity for co-presence, a common focus of formal educational institutions on spoken language for interaction makes communication inaccessible to some students, thus impeding their participation in learning. As such, toward providing resources for nonverbal autistic students we must ask: How do we design for inclusive social participation of students with diverse interactional modalities? This paper outlines the development of an embodied-design solution that centers the dynamic body as the nexus of social interaction, thus reclaiming the natural versatility of multimodal interpersonal communication. The Magical Musical Mat is a domain-general platform that allows people to interact through the non-speaking modalities of touch and sound. It removes interactional asymmetry between diverse interlocutors and surfaces the basic human need and capacity to connect with one another, in school and beyond.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:26Z (GMT).

Second, by delving into “moments of expanded iterations” we examine how youth articulate ownership of their making: what that means, how and why, and the subsequent generative spaces that resulted.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:27Z (GMT).

Analysis of the combined data set (total N = 661) revealed a significant difference in overall pre-to-post learning gains in favor of students in the choice condition (compared to students in the no-choice, or standard condition).

It enables members of the public to join or set up their own investigations or ‘missions’ to explore themselves and their environment. Each mission involves finding out about how CS works at scale and gaining insight into current issues such as personal wellbeing. An example of an nQuire mission is Gardenwatch; this is a survey of UK private gardens, produced by BBC Springwatch and the British Trust for Ornithology. Over 200,000 people completed surveys of their gardens on nQuire, as well as sharing their findings on social media.

This has implications supporting civic engagement with data visualization.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:33Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We use the case of a high school geometry student to investigate two research questions: (1) How do embodied processes facilitate mathematical learning? (2) How can generalized mathematical truths be manifest through embodied processes that are grounded in particular movements? To engage the body, researchers developed a motion-capture video game, The Hidden Village, designed to elicit physical movement via in-game directed actions. In-game interactions complement logic and verbal forms of reasoning by promoting simulated actions, which are shown to recur during the student’s proof and justification. Embodied theories of learning offer insights into how learners recruit body-based resources to foster meaning-making and generalization. Embodiment also offers new insights into recharacterizing mathematics curricula in terms of movement, and the promise of new forms of embodied learning technologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:34Z (GMT).

In this paper, we examine four case studies of student pairs who were engaged in building and using system models in an NGSS-aligned project-based learning unit on chemical kinetics. Using a theoretical framework that describes how CT and ST practices are manifested in the modeling process we examine the progression of students’ models during their model revisions and explore strategies they employ to overcome modeling challenges they face. We discuss some suggestions to scaffold students’ progression in constructing computational system models and prepare teachers to support their students in engaging in CT and ST practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:46Z (GMT).

Findings indicate that the teacher-coach interactions included talk at three altitudes: within, across, and beyond moments of the lesson. Additionally, collaborative sensemaking happened briefly during the lesson, but was more extended at the end of the lesson. These findings show how side-by-side coaching can provide opportunities for collective sensemaking and point to its potential rhythms across a lesson.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:46Z (GMT).

This study investigates whether online PD can achieve the same impact for high school biology teachers and students using computer-supported complex systems curriculum and instruction. We articulate changes in design decisions to accommodate the online mode and measure impact on teachers’ perceptions of their experiences and student outcomes. The results show positive teacher perceptions in both PD formats and roughly equal student outcomes.

This paper utilizes conceptual tools from organizational theory to understand this interplay for two teachers working within the same middle school, adopting instructional practices associated with the Framework for K-12 Science Education. While on the surface, both teachers had similar personal, social, and organizational resources for their sensemaking and a shared commitment to integrating reform, only one implemented Framework practices, while the other maintained more traditional approaches. This analysis demonstrates ambiguity as a key differentiator in teachers’ sensemaking and enactment of reform. Ambiguity close to practice served as a catalyst for noticing and enacting instructional change.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We argue that the bias toward pattern-seeking in Chinese national standards and curricula, combined with students’ ability and propensity to propose at least the seeds of mechanistic explanations, helps explain the classroom tension between pattern-seeking and mechanism reasoning. In discussion, we extend the argument to show a less severe but similar bias toward pattern-seeking in the United States’ Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:47Z (GMT).

By doing so, we address two challenges for research of teaching and learning: (1) the under-conceptualization of the teacher role during students’ groupwork; and (2) the need to explicate the connection between teaching and learning. We suggest that, to connect student learning to teacher monitoring practices, it is valuable to link two different scales of analysis: (1) between-groups teacher groupwork monitoring routines; and (2) within-groups interactions with and without the teacher. We argue that such methodology affords a generative discussion of teachers’ instructional practices and their disruption or reproduction of exclusionary aspects of students’ conversations. To illustrate our approach, we look at two teachers. First, we describe and compare their groupwork monitoring routines. Then, we look at students’ conversations within those classrooms and discuss connections between these conversations and instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:48Z (GMT).

Models of how teachers can navigate these tensions are needed to help teachers shift their practice. In this study, we investigate three teachers working with the same instructional materials designed to support student agency and examine variations in how they navigate these tensions. We identify how their differential practices around organizing collective knowledge-building may interact with opportunities for students to take on epistemic agency.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:48Z (GMT).

We analyzed classroom observation ratings and video recordings of classroom teaching in order to understand novice teachers’ development as social justice science educators. We found evidence that teachers improved over time in their efforts to use specific instructional strategies to enact social justice science teaching.

Also, the teachers reported that the critical questions (CQs) deepened students’ reasoning, but some CQs were more useful than others.

These fields address problems that demand hybrid representations, which materially integrate multiple models to compose model systems, offering perspectives on large complex systems. We argue that habits-of-mind that support hybridization exist not only in professional labs but also in classrooms; we demonstrate that 6th grade students recognize the need for hybrid model systems to explain complex phenomena. Like researchers, students justify the need for hybrid models in relation to sometimes-conflicting commitments and constraints. In this context, we find that students hybridize models narratively and rhetorically, a resource for convergence thinking and a precursor to material hybridization.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:49Z (GMT).

I investigate the experience of Marie as she attempted to enact her commitments to building an asset-based classroom math community while immersed in a school context focused on identifying and fixing students’ individual mathematical deficits. Findings indicate that though Marie remained committed to this vision, her learning was heavily constrained by her school activity system, resulting in a steep personal cost for Marie.

This study leverages the RepTaL framework to explore the multiple dimensions of teachers’ representational understanding including their understanding of representational forms, ways of including representations within science, and ideas about what aspects of phenomena students should represent. We have used this framework to analyze interviews with 6 teachers in rural schools in the midwestern United States. We present an analysis of these interviews as an illustration of both the breadth of teacher ideas about representations including some of the limitations and as an illustration of how the RepTaL framework helps to make these ideas visible.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:52Z (GMT).

Yet much remains to be learned about how teachers self-capture video from their own classrooms while teaching, which has important implications for teacher and student learning opportunities. This paper explores how in-service primary grades teachers participating in a professional learning course self-captured video that specifically centered student thinking. Drawing on the theoretical lens of professional vision (Goodwin, 1994), we asked what teachers highlighted as salient for seeing student thinking when self-capturing, and how they orchestrated their recording and classroom activity in service of this seeing. Analyses demonstrate shifts over time in the windows teachers highlighted for seeing student thinking in video and depict the substantial orchestration work teachers engaged in to facilitate both accessing and enhancing student thinking within self-captured video.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:52Z (GMT).

Thirty-two articles, which were selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, were reviewed. Four different categories of conceptions of reflection were identified. The review also indicated instructional strategies designed to foster reflection that include evaluation of practice, meta-reflection, identifying critical incidents, conceptual argument, and experience sharing. Despite the variety of conceptions and instructional strategies, however, preservice teachers were provided with limited opportunities of reflecting on their beliefs, values and personal experiences. Also, there were seldom opportunities for reflection beyond classroom context such as everyday life and a larger socio-cultural context.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:53Z (GMT).

Fifty-four transcribed teacher-meeting excerpts were analyzed using the CLIP coding scheme for teacher collaborative inquiry into practice, assessing aspects of inquiry-based reasoning, collaboration and focus on pedagogy (teacher actions, student thinking and disciplinary content). Quantitative comparisons showed that, overall, collaborative inquiry into practice was lowest during peer consultations, in part because teachers were often not positioned as agents of change in such conversations. Teachers tended to inquire into each other’s ideas more often during pedagogical planning. Surprisingly, teacher team video analysis activities were not characterized by higher measures of attention to student thinking, nor inquiry orientation. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Findings reveal that Latinx students were significantly marginalized in class discussions, as evidenced by quantitative analytics generated by the EQUIP observation tool (https://www.equip.ninja). Discourse analysis shows how Mrs. Stone’s description of these students as “well-behaved” and “fragile”—and her positioning of a student named Debra as a “good girl”—aligned with problematic racial and race-gender narratives about Latinx people and Latinx girls, and consequently prevented Mrs. Stone from soliciting their participation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:53Z (GMT).

How do teachers navigate the role of ‘facilitator’, and what are the pedagogical best practices for doing so. Here, we address these questions by examining facilitation in one set of in- and after-school making and learning environments, called [program name].

Grounded in the community of practice identity negotiation framework, results suggest that EFL pre-service teachers’ processes of identity negotiation mainly resided somewhere between adoption and rejection of legitimate practices in the EFL teacher community, in what we call a zone of tension. The findings of this research indicate that pre-service teachers’ identity negotiation processes centered on three main notions: (1) the native speaker as a standard, (2) reflections on accents, and (3) reflections on language practices. These findings contribute to the extant conversation challenging the NS-NNS dichotomy and understanding identity as a dynamic social construct in teacher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:54Z (GMT).

We used data from 172 high school chemistry classroom videos to illustrate the utility of MFRM to model latent constructs related to raters. The analysis shows our raters can display high internal consistency with varying levels of bias despite intensive training. Such differences can significantly impact claims about teacher practice. We demonstrate how MFRM can incorporate these differences into a model that accounts for rater biases and other threats to validity. Additionally, the model allows for the incorporation of individual raters’ expertise into measures of teacher practice by accounting for identified variability without removing it.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:56Z (GMT).

This study examines four teachers’ practical conceptions of epistemic agency: the images of practice they associate with what “students participating with epistemic agency” looks like. To do this, we interviewed teachers before and after they enacted science units that they had designed with the goal of supporting students’ epistemic agency. We present four key constructs involved in teachers’ practical conceptions (coherence, flexibility, relevance, and student participation) and show how each teacher uniquely described these constructs in their teaching. This study is a starting point for characterizing the multidimensional work involved in supporting students as epistemic agents, including ongoing tensions that were raised. We discuss the implications of this work for supporting teacher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:56Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, given the ubiquity technology plays in our lives, it is imperative that all students have access to CT. Few studies have focused on how pre-service teachers (PSTs) learn about CT. Some researchers argue that CT integration into K-12 education belongs in teacher preparation programs and that teacher educators should develop courses aimed at supporting PSTs’ understanding of CT in the context of schools. This paper explores the ways in which PSTs begin to understand CT and how they work to integrate CT into their core subject areas.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:57Z (GMT).

Our findings show that, in regular routinized instruction, learning was streamlined and compressed to unidirectional acquirement. In contrast, designed embodied mathematics lessons offered a space of flexibility and spontaneity, which conceivably drove intellectual emancipation. Our research demonstrates how spatially and temporally expanded mathematics pedagogy can offer a complex system of iterative adaptation and decentralized learning. We discuss how integrating embodied mathematics learning and the perspective of intellectual emancipation can address equity issues in early mathematics education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:58Z (GMT).

In this work, we describe a process of co-design with researchers and teachers to develop CT-infused science curricula. Specifically, we present a case study of one veteran physics teacher whose conception of CT during a professional development institute changed over time. We use this case study to explore how CT is perceived in physics instruction, a field that has a long history of computational learning opportunities. We also discuss how a co-design process led to the development of a lens through which to identify fruitful opportunities to integrate CT activities in physics curricula which we term computational transparency–purposefully revealing the inner workings of computational tools that students already use in the classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:58Z (GMT).

These resources and overlapping figured worlds of family, community, and computing allowed family members to explore new possible selves in the context of computing.

Therefore, teacher educators would benefit from knowing how their pre-service teacher interns (aka student teachers) are framing their various classroom interactions. Unfortunately, detailed framing analysis typically relies on Interaction Analysis of video recordings. Teacher educators rarely have the access and time needed to collect and analyze such data. More commonly, teacher educators obtain pre-service teachers’ written reflections about their classroom interactions. We argue that a “lite” version of framing analysis allows teacher educators to infer at least a rough sense of how pre-service teachers are framing various classroom episodes, and this rough framing attribution is “instructionally actionable” in that it can inform the teacher educator’s next steps with pre-service teachers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:59Z (GMT).

Scholars have shown how technocracy and meritocracy contribute to marginalization within engineering education (Slaton, 2015; Foor et al., 2007; Secules et al., 2018). Our team has been iteratively redesigning a pedagogy seminar for engineering peer educators to disrupt such forces of marginalization. We study peer educators because they can do harm if these ideologies aren't challenged, and they have the potential to disrupt these ideologies. Using tools from discourse analysis and the ideology-in-pieces framework (Philip, 2011), we analyze how technocratic stances are reproduced or challenged in engineering peer educators’ talk. Such analyses can help others to recognize technocratic reasoning and see some of its negative consequences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:00Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, research often assumes teachers’ perspectives are relatively consistent and stable. This paper begins to challenge this assumption for pre-service teachers by documenting a paradigmatic case of one pre-service secondary math teacher’s sensemaking around the problem of student mathematical difficulty during field experiences. By examining how this teacher expressed causal reasoning about this problem during an interview, shifts in the teacher’s framing of this problem between productive and unproductive frames with respect to equity are apparent. These findings suggest that teacher education could support teachers to cue productive frames rather than replace unproductive frames.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:02Z (GMT).

Using pre-service teacher interviews and course artifacts, and instructor reflections and observations, this study seeks to better understand how pre-service teachers’ perspectives of science, goals for teaching science, and vision for their students shifted after engaging in an equity and justice-centered secondary science methods course. Findings from this study have implications for secondary science teacher education, policy, and practice. By exploring the learning and development of secondary science teachers through a critical, sociocultural, and learning sciences lens, findings demonstrate the types of experiences that have the potential to transform the teaching and learning of science in schools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:03Z (GMT).

In an ethnographic approach, we followed the routines of a team of canoers and collected video records (with helmet cameras) of the full arc of the activity, from the collective, discursive construction of the plan through the entire rapids run. We find that any given plan provided resources for canoeing action, without exhaustively describing it. Knowledgeable performance in the rapids thus emerged from the planning process and, crucially, the historically constituted practices of the team and individuals’ embodied knowledge and skills of canoeing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:04Z (GMT).

Emotions can be displayed in social interaction both verbally and non-verbally, explicitly and implicitly. This symposium presents four studies using a variety of discourse analysis methodologies to study socio-emotional dynamics in a range of professional development contexts: pre-service teachers in a science content and pedagogy course, science teachers within a blended-online program, math teachers in video-based debrief conversations, and elementary/middle school teachers in school-based team meetings. The findings of the four papers shed light into the critical role socio-emotional dynamics play in teacher professional learning, revealing different kinds of dynamics appearing in a broad range of topics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:05Z (GMT).

First, research often tests efficacy of professional learning interventions without illuminating how teachers learn within the intervention. Second, as a field, we have not reached consensus on how to document teacher learning, making it hard to share results in robust ways. For instance, researchers rarely view and discuss video from each other’s professional learning interventions, making it difficult to build shared ideas about concepts like “noticing student thinking” or about specific experiences that build teacher learning. To address these issues, this session will present professional learning video from four research projects focused on teachers’ learning to improve mathematics instruction. Video will be linked to a tentative conceptual framework of teacher learning that will be critiqued by the audience, discussant, and presenters, in order to expand it, identify gaps, and provide a shared framework for future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:05Z (GMT).

Moreover, we situate the work of teacher learning and teacher education as a viable pathway for exploring the ethical and political dimensions of learning and teaching within learning sciences. What opens up in the field of education when we take seriously the minds and personhood of teachers as learners who are simultaneously theorists, practitioners and political actors within complex ecologies? How might we leverage, at once, the generative tools of the learning sciences and the everyday, embodied and professional knowledge brought to bear by teachers? And finally, what tensions emerge within this work as we seek to expand conceptions of teaching and desettle narrow, dehistoricized definitions of learning (Bang et al, 2012; Philip et al, 2019)? Each paper proposed for this symposium responds to these question prompts with social design experiments (Gutiérrez & Vossoughi, 2010) that meld critical theories within the learning sciences with ideas about how to reimagine teacher learning and teacher professional development toward more just social futures.

We build upon this legacy by further theorizing the role that stories and storywork play within (1) sense-making activities, (2) the lives of communities that we have been a part, and (3) our own lives as researchers-storylisteners across time and place. We take a syncretic approach, bringing together learning sciences research and perspectives from Black and Indigenous studies on the acts of creating, telling, and listening to stories. We consider the multiple roles of stories in research and design, the political/ethical nature of stories, and how storywork can re-organize power relations in ways that support individual and community life.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:07Z (GMT).

Such learning cannot be taken for granted in the typical school culture, however, as sharing problems exposes teachers’ work to scrutiny and criticism and may threaten the teachers’ face. This study examines under which circumstances face-work is involved in teachers’ discussion of problems of practice, based on interviews with leading teachers and observations of in-school meetings they led. Initial findings point to four major circumstances: (1) type of representation discussed (e.g., classroom video recordings, narrated case studies, or artifacts of student work); (2) group goal orientation (e.g., developing expertise versus demonstratingexpertise); (3) group composition and micropolitics in terms of teacher seniority and administrative roles; and (4) group maturation over time. The study advances our understanding of the socio-emotional processes involved in teacher collaborative learning, specifically the role of face-work in group discussion of problems of practice. On a practical level, understanding how and when face-work is involved in teacher discussions can help us better design and facilitate teacher collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:07Z (GMT).

In our methods class, we wanted PSTs to rehearse noticing and exercising pedagogical reasoning as they served as the primary instructional leaders for an extended rehearsal of teaching we call “macroteaching”. We propose that macroteaching serves as an opportunity for PSTs to encounter unanticipated talk and actions, to make purposeful pedagogical decisions based on the emergent student discourse, and to move forward with instruction based on the decisions they made in-the-moment. In this paper, we describe how PSTs negotiated four learning opportunities during macroteaching, and describe our learning as teacher educators over three years of macroteaching enactment in methods courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:07Z (GMT).

Drawing on Derrida’s interrogation of hospitality as a metaphor for inclusive and equitable classrooms, it offers a window into how teachers make sense of the complexity and ambiguity of relational work in a way that honors both student agency and their own authority. Findings can support secondary mathematics researchers and teachers in parsing and acting on the ethical commitments entailed in doing relational work within an unjust educational system.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:08Z (GMT).

The findings show that: (a) teachers perceived relational goals as the most important goals for their PLC; and (b) while school culture predicted mastery, performance, and relational goals structures, only mastery goals significantly predicted teacher collaboration. These findings suggest that PLCs aiming to promote teacher learning through collaboration should focus more on learning goals than on sheer social goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:08Z (GMT).

I present a case where a State system was well-aligned around text-based writing instruction. Teachers also had common understandings of the policies and aligned their goals for instruction. However, whether this was a successful system depends on the learning theory used to evaluate it. The coherent and tightly aligned system is a “success” within a behaviorist or cognitivist frame, but in tension with sociocultural theories: both in what was emphasized and lost and how alignment and convergence occurred. High-stakes tests were the lynchpin of alignment, which created institutional pressures for teachers to acculturate their writing instruction to test-based goals. As a result, educational discourse narrowed and converged, but at the expense of engaging with the sociopolitical, epistemic, ethical, and cultural aspects of literacy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:09Z (GMT).

Our findings suggest that children were challenged to connect the symbolic markers with the robot’s movement, requiring teacher scaffolding and facilitation. Nonetheless, we argue that coding experiences can support preschool mathematics learning outside of traditional pathways.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:09Z (GMT).

I find that active listening and foregoing control over individual ideas to pursue collective imagining enabled students to negotiate the risks in a way that allowed them to productively engage in crafting a meaningful math problem.

However, such studies have largely overlooked how teachers engage with formal concepts. By analyzing two contrasting discussions in one teacher meeting, which centered on the pedagogical concept of feedback, we explore how teachers manage uncertainty concerning such formal concepts. Specifically, we highlight the importance of paying more attention to epistemic moves in group discussions, as such moves represent a collective effort to integrate formal concepts with teachers' lived experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:10Z (GMT).

We examine the changing epistemological frames (Hammer, Elby, Scherr, & Redish, 2005) through which students view their engineering work and describe how the PSTs talked and wrote about the relationships among engineering and their future practice as elementary and early childhood educators. Across the course, we see development from naïve notions of engineering’s importance as “hands-on” and engaging to more robust epistemologies about engineering as design and teaching engineering as creating productive contexts for students’ design processes. We focus on two students’ accounts of their own experiences of the engineering design process as centrally relevant to their pedagogical practice with elementary students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:14Z (GMT).

Supporting expansive sense-making, increased epistemic agency and authority, and more meaningful, consequential learning has proven elusive in elementary classrooms. Why is this the case? What can be done? This paper presents themes derived from analysis of multiple elementary science classroom video cases to hypothesize how sense-making shifts happen, albeit briefly, in a variety of classroom contexts and situations. Observing patterns in sense-making shifts enables us to confront how deep historical and cultural legacies of the grammar of schooling may inhibit shifts toward sense-making in science classrooms. These hypotheses raise implications for teacher education and for organizing schools to foster sense-making goals to support expansive and transformative science learning experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:16Z (GMT).

We focus on three complementary and interrelated instructional practices - the use of (a) flexibility-eligible tasks, (b) structured instructional routines that leverage comparison of multiple strategies, and (c) discussion prompts that push students to consider affordances and constraints of the strategies that they have used.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:16Z (GMT).

This study addresses how two 3rd grade teachers made sense of the intersection of disciplinary practices and pedagogical practices to support student learning. We present preliminary findings from a Research-Practice Partnership that worked with elementary teachers to integrate aspects of CS/CT practice into existing content areas. We identified two main disciplinary activities that drove their curriculum design and pedagogical practices: (1) the importance of productive frustration and failure; and (2) the importance of precision.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:16Z (GMT).

Drawing on ethnographic data from participant observation and interviews, I argue that the emotionality of being part of the activist community provided intrinsic value but also became part of instrumental understandings that linked feeling “empowered” by the community to practices like speaking up for one’s values and participating in direct action. I introduce the concept of casual emotion work to describe how seemingly non-pedagogical practices during community social events can support the uptake of ways of feeling that are understood as strategically valuable for broader social transformation. The study has implications for how learning scientists understand emotion as a dimension of relationality with consequences for both learning and politics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:18Z (GMT).

We find that during their introductory whole-class discussion of the investigation, one teacher focused on helping students consider how to construct the physical set-ups to get the data they wanted, while the other teacher focused on having students identify all the variables that could come into play. The teachers differed on what to scaffold and when, including which aspects of set-up design to specify versus which to elicit from their students. Taken together, the scaffolding strategies these teachers used during whole-class guided discussion offer several new ideas for preparing students to engage productively with noisy data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:18Z (GMT).

After analyzing transcripts from recordings of FOLC meetings, we found that while these discussions at times recreate problematic student framings, there are also explicit challenges to this ideology (e.g. away from dominant problematic framings toward a focus on student learning). We find that these contestations are taken up more in later meetings though there isn’t necessarily a clear convergence on these alternative ideologies. In further research, we hope to determine if convergence toward alternative ideologies and a focus on student learning occurs more frequently over time within the FOLC.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:19Z (GMT).

Posthumanism is about rethinking the relations between the human and nonhuman by challenging the anthropocentric thinking. Education scholars tend to regard posthumanism as critical social theories rather than theoretical frameworks for practice. The emergence of posthuman discourses in the field of education indicates a need for a pedagogy that represents the transformation. However, there is a lack of research on how posthuman pedagogy is defined, described, and practiced. This study presents findings from a conceptual analysis, which elucidates four characteristics of the idea of posthuman pedagogy. Based on these characteristics, we argue that posthuman pedagogy informs the rethinking of the relationships embodied in pedagogy and the reimagination of the dynamic practice of learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:20Z (GMT).

The scenario was implemented as an in-class small group activity with undergraduates enrolled in an elementary licensure program. The main findings reveal four typical response components—apologize, explain, solve, and appreciate. Our results are presented in two sections. First, descriptive statistics are used to analyze the occurrence and co-occurrence of codes by response. Second, using qualitative analysis, we describe some of the different sub-codes (e.g., direct apology vs. non-apology) that, in turn, reflect different interpersonal relationships. Lastly, we discuss the significance of this work, implications for teacher education, and future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Here, we attempt to engage with the teachers in a meaningful way. This paper captures the initial understanding of making in a cohort of 21 science and 19 mathematics teachers of government schools in India. Further, it highlights the nuances in the understanding of the making culture (developing a framework) and its broader implications after reflecting on the video prompt and collective discussion with the teachers. Using this evidence of teachers eliciting subtleties of learning and making culture, we argue for a greater possibility of and a need for meaningful teacher-researcher engagement for reimagining learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:23Z (GMT).

However, even in research showing the importance of sociocultural factors, quantitative assessment of Computer Science learning has been predominantly cognitive. This study presents an example of how quantitative assessments of learning, based on cognitive and sociocultural framings of learning, can be put into dialogue by developing measures of learning on internal individual terms and understood as participation in a community of practice. We develop two participation-based constructs assessed using methods from learning analytics, and show that each is significantly associated with better performance on a cognitively-based summative assessment of computer science content. These associations are mediated by the content of students' programs. Beyond serving as contextual factors for cognitive assessments, we propose treating these constructs as primary evidence of learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:32Z (GMT).

The study is situated in the context of a programme-level culmination task enacted as a public, performance-based assessment in which small groups of pre-service teachers devise and perform interactive poster presentations to peers, teachers and community stakeholders. Specifically, the study focuses on the talk and actions of pre-service teachers (n=6) and their expert instructors (n=5) across 12 video recordings (in-class rehearsals and final presentations) and 6 audio recorded video-stimulated recall interviews with the pre-service teachers (post-assessment). Analysis-in-progress builds on Pellegrino’s (2018) concept of ‘evidentiary reasoning’ to trace situated expert and peer feedback and student self-reflections within and across the in-class rehearsals and the final capstone performances. Findings are illuminating the consequential impact of these dialogues on pre-service teacher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

When teachers learn, they listen to people talk about teaching, or talk about teaching themselves, but they very rarely do the work of teaching. Games and simulations offer a promising framework to advance practice-based professional training for complex skills such as teaching. In this work, we built a role-playing simulation ELK to help teachers develop effective questioning strategies to elicit learner prior knowledge. We evaluate ELK with 76 pre-service teachers in two modes, “Chat” and “Code”. We find that in both modes ELK raises teachers’ awareness about student misconceptions and the importance of student thinking, and teachers demonstrate a modest increase in effective questioning strategies after three rounds of playing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:43Z (GMT).

We used case study analytic methods to understand each state context before conducting qualitative comparative analysis to analyze the configurations of inputs that supported the most progress toward equity. The analysis revealed that progress toward equity in state systems was consistent with the configurations of constancy with routines, constancy with infrastructure, or collective efficacy on its own. It is hopeful that collective efficacy was a sole input for two states with progress toward equity and coherence, yet progress should be systemic, not placed on individuals. We discuss tensions in understanding equity at scale through qualitative comparative methodology and case studies as well as practical ramifications for educational leaders.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:49Z (GMT).

We examine how children’s ideas, knowledge and desires are centered (or not) in public computing and how that influences the types of engagements that families have in a public computing environment. We present an analysis of three cases, each showcasing different patterns of interaction. In one case, a preverbal child is centered in their interaction through the actions and utterances of her parents. In another case, a father provides translation support such that his daughter can make her desired code changes a reality. Finally, we present a case in which the father’s actions and words strongly guide the interaction, decentering the goals of the child. Our study has implications for future research regarding family interactions in museums, as well as the design of informal learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:49Z (GMT).

We used an electronic exit ticket and two multilevel logistic regression models to estimate differences in students’ contributions to knowledge-building activities in the classroom controlling for student-level demographics. These analyses demonstrate that the instruction students experience can be measured at multiple levels of analysis and that these analyses can reveal differences that are associated with the race, gender, and home language of students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:50Z (GMT).

In crafting conditions for the project implementation, one of the design principles is building multilevel architecture for learning to strengthen school leaders and teachers’ capacity to be self-organized in the long term. In-depth case studies on two schools participating in the project shows feedback loops play a key role in the self-organized learning of teachers and school principals.

Our comparative case study explores how instances of dialogical learning facilitated boundary crossing (Akkerman and Bakker, 2011), which played a key role in shaping scaling efforts and usability. We illustrate how scale can be conceptualized and studied as a learning problem, using the lens of boundary crossing.

This can create a tension because the theory and mechanisms generated from small scale studies can be difficult to implement and study at larger scales.

Digital technologies often reimagine how learning occurs, requiring new capacities for adults who use them with children and new pathways for scale-up. Drawing on interviews, case studies, and a comprehensive literature review on scale in education and other fields, the framework provides guidance for designers who seek to spread and scale digital learning innovations and for researchers who seek to study these processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:53Z (GMT).

We share analyses of two episodes from one youth’s learning pathway to illustrate how a cross-setting analysis can expand a single-sited conceptualization of his   resources for learning, in this case to include relational practices. This paper advances current scholarship on learning across settings by examining closely and empirically how cross-setting approaches might productively trouble and re-configure how we conceptualize nondominant youths' lives in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:55Z (GMT).

The OpenSciEd project has the explicit goal of meeting three competing goals in order to have impact at scale: implementing findings from research (research-based), meeting the practical constraints of American public school classrooms (practicality), and creating products that will be widely adopted in the market place (marketability). In this symposium, we will discuss how these three competing goals have influenced the organization of the project, the design of instructional materials, the design of professional learning experiences for teachers, and the collection and analysis of data in field trials.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:56Z (GMT).

That is, conducting interviews with experts in the field of scaling-up adaptive educational technologies. By conducting expert interviews, we had access to their accumulated expertise about scaling factors and the interplay between these factors. For our analysis, we applied Epistemic Network Analysis. The analysis positioned collaboration between stakeholders at the core of the network and revealed the strongest connection between collaboration and teacher characteristics such as teacher concerns, competencies and professional development.

This approach can be implemented in any modern learning management system or using Google tools. It was successfully used to scale up an online course for hundreds of open learners. But an extended partnership to scale out at a fully online high school revealed that educators who were unfamiliar and/or uncomfortable with sociocultural theory found the approach difficult to implement. In response, five design principles have been reframed as fourteen specific steps that do not require familiarity with sociocultural theory. This promises to help users learn how the approach works while designing, delivering, and scaling courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this study, we examined the adaptations made by mathematics teacher leaders to a highly-adaptive program of professional development. We considered how teacher leaders modified, omitted, and created activities, focusing questions, and other aspects of the program. We found that facilitators made modifications to address local priorities, yet also omitted core program activities as the project progressed. Our study illustrates a tension encountered by developers of adaptive PD programs between wanting a program to be adaptable enough that facilitators will continue to implement it as their priorities shift and keep core aspects of the program intact.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:59Z (GMT).

This paper revisits the issue of whether and how schools may be a lousy place to learn by listening to and interpreting the perspectives of students themselves. We draw on a sample of 300 interviews with students conducted in the context of researching what and how students learned in a program called FUSE Studios, which we have previously conceptualized as “an alternative infrastructure for learning in schools”. We asked students whether and how FUSE was different from their other classes, and their responses provided us with a unique window into what students think of school as a learning environment. Herein, we share their perspectives and draw implications for future learning sciences work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In other words, we find pervasive proxies to the measurements that have been reported to be obtrusive.

In this study, I investigate how a classroom community shifted to become a place where students regularly participated in risky science knowledge-building. I theorize that this shift occurred through a process of trust-building, and utilize this case to further elucidate the phenomenon of trust-building in the context of science learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:10Z (GMT).

In this study, I examine how one group of 9th grade students enacted turn-taking instructions during a small-group Algebra task. Patterns of participation evolved over time, from individual turn-taking to “collaborative-play” as the need to consult with peers to address challenges arose organically. Analysis reveals turn-taking and collaborative-play supported different types of productive student participation. Turn-taking supported individual contributions by slowing down task completion and by distributing access to the conversational floor across students. Collaborative-play supported joint contributions by shifting responsibility for issue resolution from an individual to the group. Findings suggest the two modes of participation supported complementary, and most likely interdependent, types of productive participation during small-group work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:11Z (GMT).

Students used information about their affiliated institution (e.g., admission rates, admission stances, and institutional mission statements) and details from a “private” biography (e.g., life story, biases) to inform decisions about who to admit. We analyzed survey responses (n=60) and semi-structured interviews (n=7) of students who participated in the simulation.

Over time, students’ vision of Becoming a Professional showed increased emphasis on ethical practices, shifting focus from self-as-dentist to Providing the Best Patient Care. In addition to gaining Confidence through Progress to be a part of the Field of Dentistry, students also personalized their view of the profession, coming to Know Oneself as a Dentist and, at times, connecting this to their Life Vision.

In this article, we examine how teams use discourse to learn from design failure collaboratively by analyzing video data and group artifacts. Our findings suggest that the specific communication process can support or hinder the learning from failure in design contexts and that there’s a need to support team’s regulation process so they can benefit from their design failure.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:12Z (GMT).

In other settings, when children engage in mathematical thinking, they often do so in service of purposeful actions situated in ongoing activities. This study rests on the premise that immersive video games can be designed to provide a context for purposeful mathematical thinking. This paper examines middle-school students’ mathematical thinking in a video game designed to support applications of proportional reasoning. Data sources include screen-records of game play from two 6th-grade classrooms. Data analysis aims to identify and characterize the kinds of mathematical thinking students engaged in during game play. Findings suggest that in the same video game students’ mathematical thinking varied, both within and between students, reflecting previously observed distinctions between street and school mathematics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:13Z (GMT).

Yet, very few studies explored in-depth move-taking sequences that indicated sustained group thinking trajectory. To help address this gap, the present study conceptualized thinking sustainability to characterize the co-constructiveness of individuals’ thinking and quantified it as an index on the interdependence of productive talk moves taken by individuals. The study further demonstrated how thinking sustainability dynamically developed in collaborative mathematical problem solving by 30 four-person groups in primary schools. Results showed that each group engaged in productive talk for around 3.85 consecutive turns. There was no significant correlation between thinking sustainability and group outcomes. Thinking sustainability was sensitive to early exchanges in peer talk and reached a stable level quite soon. This demonstrated it as another possible fixed-point attractor underlying random-looking peer interaction systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We used contrasting cases to support students’ sense-making between algebraic equations and diagrams in the self-explanation activity. We conducted a classroom experiment with 41 students in grades 5 and 6 to test the effectiveness of this strategy when embedded in an Intelligent Tutoring System for algebra. We found that scaffolded diagrammatic self-explanation enhanced conceptual knowledge for students who did not have prior knowledge of formal equation-solving strategies. The study is the first experimental study showing that visual representations can enhance conceptual knowledge in early algebra.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:16Z (GMT).

Not only do learners need to have collaboration skills and knowledge about beneficial interaction processes, but they also need to monitor socio-cognitive conditions to be able to regulate their own as well as their learning partners’ behaviour. External collaboration scripts are an explicit way to support collaborating learners and compensate for insufficient cognitive schemata, so called internal collaboration scripts. Group awareness tools guide learning activities implicitly and compensate for a lack of awareness of relevant socio-cognitive conditions while explicitly relying on the learners’ self-regulatory skills. A combination of the different approaches has been investigated scarcely so far, though they have a promising potential for mutual synergies. Thus, in this symposium, researchers from scripting-, group awareness-, and regulation-research discuss how their approaches are connected and how external collaboration scripts or group awareness tools can be combined to support collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:17Z (GMT).

How does attending to gender and sexuality expand how we understand learning? And how can the field be mobilized to design affirming learning environments for LGBTQ+-identifying people? Across the papers, we explore gender and sexuality’s relevance for learning in contexts as wide-ranging as video channels on YouTube, an LGBTQ+ youth social group, Twitter networks of drag queen activists, and a public computing participatory simulation. Taken together, these papers will deepen the field’s attention to gender and sexuality in learning sciences theories, methods, and designs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:17Z (GMT).

The abundance of digital technologies and rapid changes in knowledge domains generate new epistemic and learning practices, drawing on heterogeneous sets of resources, actors, and forms of knowledge. Consequently, learners must navigate complex and unstructured landscapes to gather resources and structure activities. Little is known about these processes and how they can be studied and enhanced. This symposium argues for the necessity of a paradigmatic shift towards an ‘ecological understanding’ of learning, which takes into account the enactment of the learning ‘act’, the knowledge forms, contexts, relationships, digital technologies and infrastructures that shape learning practices in unbound landscapes. The four contributions in this symposium use empirical illustrations to build an argument leading towards a new learning research and design agenda. These contributions are complementary as they pinpoint practices students, teachers and institutions engage with in this unbounded landscape.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:18Z (GMT).

Cognitive interactions mediate knowledge sharing, construction, and creation, while social-emotional interactions shape student perception of community climate and influence their emotional expressions, which, in turn, have a significant impact on their cognitive interactions. Although research has consistently found that social presence and student-student interaction has a positive influence on students' learning through emotional engagement, subject-based teaching remained largely more of cognitive activities. Teachers tend to treat lessons that heightened social-emotional aspects separate from subject-based lessons. This symposium brings together an international group of scholars to present recent studies on emotion and cognition in collaborative learning environments. Methods, such as self-report, video observation, affective state detection using FACET, and machine learning models, were adopted to investigate students' emotions. The results collectively suggest that these methods indeed served to uncover students' emotions; emotions such as joy/enjoyment/happiness, confidence, and surprise were associated with students' knowledge building progress; and that students' online interactions had a high impact on the emotional and linguistic tone of learners. The symposium aims to discuss the theoretical, practical and policy implications of these studies on collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:19Z (GMT).

This session explores how several scholars have applied and pushed for revisions of existing theories as the Learning Sciences field seeks to better understand young children’s sensemaking. Each paper takes up two central questions: (1) How is existing LS theory drawn upon in each study? (2) How is new theory built or existing LS theory modified in each study? The goal of attending to these questions is that participants in this symposium might better understand the ways that existing theory does and does not work when studying young children.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:20Z (GMT).

This study conceptualizes ‘brokering pre-professional learning opportunities’ as a practice that goes beyond facilitating access across settings to include concerns about when, exactly, an opportunity is ‘safe enough’ when supporting connections for minoritized youth populations. Utilizing a design-based research approach, we report results of an organizational ‘vetting’ routine used to assess whether companies being considered for work-placement sites were appropriate for minoritized youth of color. Our findings confirm that characteristics of staff diversity and equity orientation of work-placement organizations can support or hinder positive learning outcomes. However, we also found that both strengths and limitations in terms of diversity and equity, in concert with other supportive factors, can be productive resources within the context of future goal setting for youth of color. We close with implications for those interested in promoting equity-oriented cross-setting learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:23Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

What does foregrounding ethics mean for how we design and study human learning and meaning-making? Each paper addresses these questions by providing key empirical examples drawn from ethnographic research on the activity, relationality and learning of 1) researchers; 2) teachers; and 3) students. Our analysis is aimed at constructing lenses that challenge the politics of neutrality in research on learning, and that deepen our analytic perception by helping us attune to intellectual and relational dimensions of learning that we may not otherwise see.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:23Z (GMT).

However, over socio-historic time we have created institutions that have shifted, disrupted, and transformed not only what is, or is not learned in intergenerational contexts but also how learning itself unfolds. This is particularly true in industrialized nation states in which mass schooling has become a central facet of childhood (e.g. Rogoff, 2003, Cole,  1998). Importantly, the disruption and transformation of intergenerational learning has not been happenstance or desired for all communities. Indeed, disrupting and preventing intergenerational learning (e.g. through family break up and child extraction) has been a key tool of domination across time. This symposium works to understand both the disruptions and reimaginings of the engagement of families and intergenerational learning dynamics with insights into the design of more effective learning environments that contribute to human thriving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:24Z (GMT).

This symposium takes up this challenge, exploring how organizational settings mediate practitioner learning and activity to determine the relationship between macro-level equity discourses and micro-level socio-political identity. We build on theoretical and empirical work across organizational learning, educational equity, and identity. Across these papers we explore the relationship between identity and equity work in four distinct organizational contexts: 1) a faculty learning community within a research university, 2) two education grantmaking organizations, 3) science museums, and 4) an out-of-school time STEM education provider.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:26Z (GMT).

What are the temporalities that emerge from and are imposed on communities engaged in learning? We take up a temporality lens that (1) unpacks elements of practice and identity that are obscured by placing all participants and communities in a shared framework of settler time, and (2) draws out the subjective temporalities of the event that are produced by participants in interaction. The three papers, from a study of an afterschool documentary filmmaking program, consider “slow” temporalities of learning in this setting as well as how “slowing down” research practices decolonize assumptions of settler time in marginalized spaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:27Z (GMT).

This means understanding that learning unfolds through multiple pathways that occur in relation to expansive and shifting social and contextual conditions, to which humans are constantly adapting. Emerging across relevant fields is an understanding that human learning and development unfolds within complex systems. These include interactions among physiological processes and people’s participation in cultural practices within and across time (phylogenetic time, cultural historical time, ontogenetic time, and microgenetic time) and across spaces. Here, we bring together interdisciplinary perspectives and research methods to elaborate an expansive vision of learning that ignites further inquiry into the cultural foundations of learning—the topic of a new Routledge Handbook. The symposium builds on the volume by engaging participants in roundtable discussions with authors from each of the major sections of the Handbook. Key to this inquiry are fundamental stances about what constitutes and is privileged as human ways of knowing, being, and doing. Without attention to how the question, “what is learning?,” gets understood and changes over time comes the risk of falling into reductionist and problematic views of learning, that are unfounded empirically and further reproduce social inequities,  At a time when key concerns about how educational spaces, systems, and teaching should be designed, funded, and assessed, this foundational work on learning is especially critical.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:28Z (GMT).

That is, that epistemic cognition has ethical dimensions, including that we (1) care about consequential issues, epistemic issues that have stakes, (2) have epistemic obligations, and (3) should attend to concerns of epistemic injustice.

Studies have shown that (1) learners would more successfully engage in idea improvement when they were aware of idea promisingness, and (2) they would be more successful when they had appropriate epistemic frames of idea promisingness. This study examined group differences in idea improvement processes. Seventy first-year university students (18 groups) participated in Project-based Learning with Knowledge Forum as their reflection tool. Six types of idea improvement processes were identified through socio-semantic network analyses of vocabulary in participants’ progress reports and a clustering analysis based on the temporal changes in degree centralities. Further comparative analysis with audio-recordings as additional data revealed that successful groups not only started with good judgments of idea promisingness but also continuously considered multiple ideas and jointly constructed coherent explanations based on evidence they searched.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:30Z (GMT).

Each student was given a critical thinking test at the beginning of the course, and the students were divided into high and low achievement groups based on the results. An epistemic network analysis is adopted to analyze their critical thinking behaviors in the online discussion. The results show that the epistemic network graphs of the two groups of students were significantly different, and varied at different stages of the online inquiry.

One harm that may come from epistemic injustice is that people are denied their ability to become full epistemic agents either on their own or as part of a greater knowledge production process. In this paper, we address the consequences of epistemic injustices for knowledge production processes. We argue that when pertinent experiences, knowledge, or expertise that would be provided by the harmed person is left out of a knowledge production process, the community is denied that knowledge, as well as the ability to leverage that knowledge into an alternative or deeper understanding of the situation at hand. Therefore, epistemic injustices are not only unethical. Epistemic injustices obstruct reliable epistemic practices. We discuss implications of issues of epistemic injustice for scholarship on epistemic cognition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We find that students who reported low peer support generally produced discourse that provides new information, but less cohesion, compared to students with perceived median and high support networks. Overall, students with low perceived networks also engaged in group planning, evaluation, and shared regulation less frequently compared to the other two groups.

The data draw from a teaching experiment contrasting student-driven (n=25) and teacher-guided inquiry (n=27) with primary school students. In groups, children evaluated data comparing two online search engines to argue which one was “best”. In interviews, teacher-guided inquiry groups reported greater discord (personal attack) than student-driven inquiry. Further, teacher-guided inquiry groups were largely unable to recollect the mathematical arguments under debate while their student-driven counterparts could do so with specificity. These outcomes, alongside classroom video analyses of representative debates, demonstrate that when dissent devolves into discord, the value of debate for disciplinary learning can erode. Although debate is often associated with civics or science education, this analysis argues the importance of debate as a site for understanding the disciplinary and relational dimensions of children’s experiences of mathematical learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:36Z (GMT).

We explore how StudyCrafter, a platform for creating and running research studies in the form of interactive fiction games, promotes students’ perceived and measured abilities in certain key research skills. Fourteen graduate students in a game design course used StudyCrafter during a 5-week-long unit on designing and conducting experimental research studies. Analyses of pre and posttests, and of students’ written post-unit reflections, showed that students’ confidence and abilities in designing research studies increased, but not their abilities to critique studies. This study contributes an understanding of the opportunities and challenges in using interactive fiction games to support students in developing their experimental research skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:37Z (GMT).

We document two types of learning about crosscutting concepts. The first is focused on intuitions that provide a causal explanation, while the second focuses on coherent conceptual systems that are refined over time. In both cases there is an intertwined relationship between multiple crosscutting concepts, with some foregrounded or backgrounded. The results provide a new perspective on three-dimensional science learning that incorporates crosscutting concepts and relevant learning mechanisms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:38Z (GMT).

Analysis revealed that teachers relied on a variety of evidence, used different types of evidence for different students, and used certain types of evidence more often when they perceived a misalignment between students’ performance in math class and aptitude for math. While this highlights potential for teachers to think deeply and in complex ways about their students, it also raises concerns that teachers may tend to characterize students as being certain types of math learners. Expanding the sources of evidence that teachers draw upon when describing students may open up the possibility for more students to be seen by their teachers as developing mathematicians.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:40Z (GMT).

This study demonstrates a computational approach to modeling identity in an open, online network of ed-tech innovators. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is combined with post hoc qualitative analysis to represent and make sense of online identity profiles as composites of seven latent network discourses.

Given the challenges with defining EBAS, it is not surprising that existing metrics are criticized for their lack of reliability and validity. One solution is to examine students’ authentic science practices as a proxy for EBAS. Our prior work suggested that practices in Science Classroom Inquiry (SCI) simulations, a computer-based authentic science inquiry experience, are reflective of EBAS. Here we extend our prior work to include an additional practice: hypothesis revision. Students who revised their hypothesis also had more sophisticated epistemological beliefs regarding the lack of a universal scientific method, but not the tentative nature of science knowledge. This study supports the use of practice-based assessments of difficult to measure cognitive constructs such as EBAS and suggests interesting future directions regarding evidence usage and epistemological beliefs about science.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:44Z (GMT).

Results suggest that adults take on many roles, shifting quickly between being playmates, educators, and timeouts. Adult stances are influenced by the environment as well as personal reasons for visiting the museum and their knowledge and interests. While previous research highlights children’s islands of expertise as a way for adults to relate museum exhibits to a child’s life, we suggest that the adults’ islands of expertise and interest also play an important role on what stances the adults take and meaning making.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:45Z (GMT).

In particular, we offer the theory of complex embodiment (Siebers, 2008) to help theorize embodiment as we work to understand the role of disability in learning mathematics. Disabilities such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are often understood as either medical, completely within the individual body, or socially constructed, completely outside the individual body and located in social practices. Yet ADHD is both profoundly experienced and embodied, and yet simultaneously socially constructed through cultural practices of schooling (Lambert 2019). We work to extend these theoretical frames into sociocultural theory as used within mathematics education, which we argue has lacked a way to understand embodiment as central to learning.

As a result, I conducted an ethnographic study of a high school history class that incorporated CSA, asking if and how did the integration of CSA into this history classroom influence student disciplinary learning? Through on-going qualitative analysis, initial findings indicate that the integration of CSA led to the emergence of critical history practices. I specifically look at two practices, critical historical argumentation and historical imaginative inquiry, to demonstrate how these interdisciplinary practices deepened student historical disciplinary learning and political and ethical meaning-making.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:48Z (GMT).

We also examine the overall dynamic of the classroom and the ways that students were interacting with the cubes through observational notes taken during each session. Middle school students participated in four sessions of Rubik’s Cube training designed by the lead researcher and a partner middle school teacher. Results indicate that students improved in their ability to execute two and three-dimensional mental rotation tests. Our findings provide promising evidence that instruction with the Rubik’s Cube can improve mental rotation performance of middle school students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:51Z (GMT).

To investigate this assumption, we develop a case study to examine the patterns of reasoning that fourth grade students employed over the course of an integrated earth science and geotechnical engineering unit in which inquiry and design activities are intended to inform each other. Applying Krist, Schwarz, and Reiser’s (2019) framework, we found ample evidence of mechanistic reasoning during inquiry lessons, but minimal evidence during design activities. This disciplinary difference in types of sensemaking is reasonable, as engineering is focused on creating functional solutions and not on describing phenomena. Supporting mechanistic reasoning during engineering requires reflecting on why designs work, including leveraging intentional strategies for talk and making thinking visible.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:53Z (GMT).

Preliminary results with 70 fifth-grade students suggested that in the short term each model fostered better learning of the predicted construct, yet findings suggest longer-term knowledge was better supported by students who used the particular number line model.

The prevailing explanation for this is framed in terms of attractive forces—women are drawn to e-textiles because of their alignment with “historically feminine practices” (Buchholz et al., 2014). However, these gender differences may also be due to repulsive forces. Traditional tools and materials may broadcast ambient identity cues that indicate women do not belong. This hypothesis leads to two predictions: (1) Women and girls are less likely to be interested in workshops that involve tools like wires and soldering irons because they associate those tools with feelings of exclusion and alienation, and (2) e-textiles may be more appealing to women and girls because these tools do not broadcast messages of exclusion. We tested these predictions in an online study with 42 university students (22 male, 20 female). We found that “standard” items like soldering irons and wires broadcast ambient identity cues that lowered women’s sense of belonging while having no effect on men. Additionally, we found that e-textiles did not have a similar discriminatory effect. Thus, “standard” items are not neutral, but charged with meaning, and these items broadcast messages to women that they do not belong.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:54Z (GMT).

The program under study leveraged the commonalities among performing arts, science, and engineering by engaging youth in the collective development of performances about social and environmental issues. Longitudinal ethnographic case studies were utilized to understand the complex nature of each participant’s experience in the program, including her lived (enacted) and storied (narrated) relationships with science. The ultimate goal of this study was to understand the potential of a transdisciplinary art-science approach to expand possibilities for Black and Latinx females in science education.

Theoretical arguments from information science, statistics, and developmental psychology are employed to support the inclusion of qualitative ways of thinking in measurement. The model includes two qualitative ways of thinking: ordering and grouping, for a total of four ways of thinking. Given that assessment tasks can be posed for each way of thinking, the model implies that there can be 16 types of strategy. Strategies are illustrated with examples from student interviews. The model is also shown to account well for strategies previously reported. Implications for educational practice and research are suggested.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:58Z (GMT).

One participant described himself as not a computer, and therefore unfit to execute code like the computer does. Another described himself as not a programmer, and did not value an activity that was only for learning about how code works. We mapped these learners’ self-narratives onto the Eccles Expectancy-Value Model of Achievement Choice to understand how identity relates to the choice to not trace code. While both participants valued what they could create with code, neither valued code tracing. Alternative activities might allow students with these identities to build skills in a way that aligns with their self-beliefs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:59Z (GMT).

In this paper, we report on 11 middle school students’ spatial reasoning practices while playing Minecraft. We use audio and video data of student gameplay to delineate five in-game practices that align with spatial reasoning. We expand on a student case study, to explicate these practices. The identified practices may be beneficial for studying spatial reasoning development in game-based environments and contribute to a growing body of research on ways games support development of important and transferable skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:00Z (GMT).

In this paper, we examine the experiences of 57 AP physics students engaged in designing and constructing their own physics-based ESCAPE puzzles, inspired by the popular escape room activity games. Findings indicate that these projects had particular meaning to students because of the 1) physical manifestation of their ability to bring an idea of their own creation to fruition and 2) the permanence and usability of the final project, as illustrated when students shared their puzzles with others in the class.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:02Z (GMT).

Prior work has established positive learning gains in both physics and computing for students using C2STEM, but what does synergistic learning look like in the moment? Do students see themselves as “doing physics,” “doing code,” or both? Do they see themselves as exploring like scientists, or as following rules? To address these questions, we examine video and log data of students from two classrooms as they build computational models. We find moments of synergy where students’ framing shifts fluidly back and forth between “doing physics” and “doing code”.

As a case of ensemble learning that foregrounds artistic agency, physical research supports a community of learners (1) to be comfortable and open with “unknowing,” (2) to engage playfully and “absurdly” in their inquiry and (3) to persist collectively in their inquiry over long stretches of time. These three aspects, each difficult to foster and lauded in learning environments, are grounded in the creative and physical nature of physical research.

Course design was informed by Projective Reflection (PR), a theoretical and methodological framework that conceptualizes learning as identity change in digital and non-digital environments. Numeric and text data from the three sessions were collected from 54 students and analyzed using Quantitative Ethnography (QE) techniques to identify patterns of identity exploration enacted over time. Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) was used as a QE technique to visualize the relationships between cognitive and affective PR constructs in each of the three student groups over time. Findings suggested that regardless of design changes in AVLEs, there were similarities and differences in pathways of identity exploration considering the duration of the courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:19Z (GMT).

We collected data in the form of video-recorded interactions of facilitators and visitors at the exhibit, interviews with facilitators, and field notes. Drawing from the experience of one facilitator in particular, we showcase that the “when”s of infrastructuring are strongly related to their figured worlds of computing and museums, and also to institutional regulations and norms. We argue that infrastructuring emerges through improvisational actions and patterns of behavior conducted by facilitators, which are bounded simultaneously by their figured worlds and institutional requirements. This study has implications for future work in informal education, bringing to light the complexity of facilitators’ practices in such spaces that will impact both design and learning opportunities in museums and other educational environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:24Z (GMT).

We applied this framework to assess the 35 products produced by 130 participants in 5 iterations of the program.

Studies suggest that the Maker Movement is a promising venue through which to build pro-STEM identities across diverse groups.  Through the inclusion of materials that are not typical of traditional STEM activities (e.g., electronic textiles, recycled materials), Making creates opportunities to integrate individual and cultural identities into STEM work.  However, successfully integrating and scaling up Making into formal school settings requires robust quantitative evidence that is typically valued in policy circles. This paper reports on the development and initial validation of a new approach to quantify shifts in multifaceted identity that are locally meaningful to participants in Making contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:37Z (GMT).

Our work aims to diversify the entry points to computational thinking (CT) in ways that are grounded in girls’ identities and experiences. We address the following question: How can grounding learning activities in girls’ identities provide an entry point for practicing computational thinking? We present findings from a qualitative study of CompuGirls, an informal technology program for girls of color (ages 13-17) that is implemented in collaboration with three public libraries. We highlight a lesson designed to connect CT practices to self-knowledge by examining girls’ complex identities using decomposition and abstraction. Our findings indicate that grounding learning activities in girls’ identities facilitated personal reflection supported the transfer of disciplinary practices from a personal context to a STEM context. This paper illustrates the potential of our approach to expand the entry points educators can use to engage girls in CT.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The effect of such personalized intervention was then evaluated using a repeated measure ANOVA. Findings suggest that students receiving personalized interventions expressed a lower sense of community.

While it is expected that students are given free rein to work on their projects, instructors are left with the uncertainty of whether students are in need of assistance. Instructors have to strike a difficult balance between micromanaging students and simply leaving them without any form of instructional support. Here we propose the use of Kinect sensors to consistently and continuously monitor students’ social interactions within makerspaces so that instructors can gain a more comprehensive view of their progress. Overall, the examination of type and diversity of social interactions affords instructors an early opportunity to identify struggling students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:55Z (GMT).

Knowledge building communities (KBCs) are a growth-promoting pedagogy, suitable to address these challenges. Yet, developing students’ identities as knowledge builders remains undertheorized. In this study, we rise above existing frameworks of fixedness and fluidity to elucidate how students and communities develop growth orientations. Using a grounded theoretical approach, we examined a KBC of graduate students, coding 324 relevant utterances that were expressed by the 18 students over the course of a semester. This resulted in a five-category model of fixedness and growth in KBCs that was then used to describe the overall development of the community as well as the transformation of one student. This study advances both theoretical and practical ideas about how to prepare students for life in the rapidly-changing world.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:56Z (GMT).

Statistical difference verification and correlation analysis was performed subsequently. Study shows significant difference of cognitive load between two groups. In comparison group, the variables related to fixation and saccade have a significant correlation with learning achievement. There was no correlation between the indicators of cognitive load and learning performance in the experimental group. However, there have been differences in the kinds of indicators that correlate with performance between two groups, indicating that the variables related to cognitive load may differ depending on the supporting factors available to learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:01Z (GMT).

Focusing on two cases, we investigate how they self-reflect about their academic writing process. We find that the high procrastinators have a more negative affect and report more procrastination behavior. In general, the academic writing process comes for both cases with similar emotional experiences and difficulties. However, we find that the low procrastinator reflects more elaborate, especially regarding emotions during the process, coping strategies for dealing with difficulties, and the role of collaboration partners and social aspects. This detailed analysis may help to develop specific support tools for students to avoid unpleasant emotions that may start a vicious cycle of procrastination behavior in academic writing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:05Z (GMT).

We extend this research by leveraging a syncretic approach (Gutiérrez & Jurow, 2016) to blend scientific modeling practices with everyday translanguaging practices in a generative way that leverages linguistic diversity in service of inquiry. In a design study conducted in a 6thgrade STEM classroom as part of a 9-week ecology unit, we explore the ways that students appropriated and transformed modeling and translanguaging practices. We focus on two syncretic practices that capitalize on parallels between modeling and translanguaging: (a) translating as a part of modeling and (b) using language and conversation as metaphors for interpreting and creating multimodal models. In this context, syncretic modeling and translanguaging practices contributed to productive science discourse by helping students (a) to understand complex phenomena, (b) to express ideas, and (c) to legitimize diverse linguistic and representational practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:08Z (GMT).

Targeting cognitive rather than behavioral variables allows these tools to go beyond observable processes. Thus, tool designers have to make a number of relevant decisions on how to select, collect, transform and present the group awareness information. Because these decisions are so manifold, existing tools differ vastly and it is near to impossible to compare overall tool effects. Thus, in this paper, we conducted a literature search returning 25 papers describing 18 cognitive Group Awareness Tools. We then analyzed these tools with regard to data processing from a psychological perspective to identify key decisions that may affect the learners’ collaborative learning processes. This allows us to systematically disentangle the effects of specific data processing decisions on tool functions to ultimately deduce guidelines for tool design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:09Z (GMT).

Specifically, students engaged in covariational and multivariational reasoning as they coordinated the simultaneous change of the quantities involved in the water cycle. They also exhibited transitive reasoning in terms of those quantities and relational reasoning connecting the water cycle to other science content. These forms of reasoning illustrate the power of mathematical reasoning for helping students construct an advanced understanding of the water cycle phenomenon. The findings also show that the context of science helped students to construct advanced forms of mathematical reasoning about quantities, illustrating the reciprocal relationship between math and science learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:09Z (GMT).

Yet, many institutions do not have enough classrooms outfitted with furniture that provides ideal support for collaborative interactions over shared course materials. Consequently, many instructors teach in classrooms with furniture that may not afford effective collaboration. Does classroom furniture affect undergraduate students’ learning from courses that utilize active-learning approaches? We explored this question in three undergraduate chemistry courses that placed a focus on collaboration with shared physical and virtual resources. 2,651 students in 136 sections were taught in classrooms with different furniture: traditional tables, traditional chairs, group chairs with or without wheels, and group tables with monitors. We found that low-performing students had significantly higher course grades if their classroom had group tables or flexible chairs. Further, a survey with teaching assistants revealed how teaching strategies may compensate for suboptimal classroom furniture.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:10Z (GMT).

This paper reports on an experimental investigation of an embodied molecular visualization in organic chemistry aiming to teach students about the spatial concept transformation. The study compared two groups: one group received spatial training instruction on transformation with embodied actions in the molecular visualization environment and a control group observed video captures from the same visualization. Comparisons of pre-/post- scores on mental rotation of molecular stimuli pairs showed no difference between the groups on ability to transform molecules post-intervention. We discuss possible explanations for the failure to observe learning in the present study and suggest possible gaps in embodied theory, namely around considering timescales of spatial learning and how embodied learning may interfere with prior conceptions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:11Z (GMT).

Despite differing formats, early childhood coding tools rely heavily on a similar representational infrastructure. Grids and arrows predominate, introducing a nested series of directional symbols and spatial skills children must learn in order to code. Thus, learning to think computationally is entangled with learning to think spatially and symbolically. This paper analyzes video of Kindergarten students learning to use robot coding toys and examines how they navigated programming’s representational infrastructure. We found that children drew on conventional notions of how objects move, creating a “conceptual blend” for programming robot routes (Fauconnier & Turner, 1998). We argue that coding in Kindergarten requires mapping a series of correspondences from the domain of everyday movements onto the resources available in the representational domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:12Z (GMT).

Drawing on evidence from two cases where teachers made adaptations to high quality instructional materials during the Analyzing Instruction in Mathematics through the Teaching for Robust Understanding (AIM-TRU) model for professional learning, we analyze the interplay between the teacher, instructional materials, and other participants as they took an integrity perspective to the curriculum, based on understanding the conceptual framework that underlies its design. In doing so, we show how professional learning effects implementation of materials positively when specific design choices are made.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:12Z (GMT).

We worked with a sample of 35 elementary school students in two groups, experiencing one of the teaching approaches: structured versus unstructured ER curriculum. We employed a mixed-method approach based on video and screen recorded data from eight ER lessons, post-experience focus-group interviews, and post-experience questionnaires on students’ engagement and debugging skills. Findings show that there is a list of errors commonly made by students in both groups. Moreover, the unstructured curriculum group was associated with significantly higher amount of errors than the structured curriculum group. Also, a structured curriculum was related to significantly greater efficiency in finding and debugging errors. However, the results revealed that students in the unstructured curriculum outperformed the structured curriculum in terms of their engagement levels.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:13Z (GMT).

Qualitative analyses were conducted to explore how AR facilitated the lower-level students’ learning. The current findings suggested that: the AR’s feature of distributed labor, openness, real-time feedback, and operational symbolic items sustained the lower-level students to engage with higher-level students in problem-solving activity inclusively, jointly, and authentically.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:14Z (GMT).
