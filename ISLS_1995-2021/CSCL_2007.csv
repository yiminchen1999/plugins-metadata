Example analytic frameworks from each category are presented in detail rich enough to illustrate their nature and structure. Synthetic discussions of each category consider the frameworks in light of the underlying theoretical perspectives on argumentation, pedagogical goals, and online environmental structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:00Z (GMT).

This paper reports on several sessions of mathematics problem solving in the VMT Chat environment. The VMT Chat is a synchronous chat and whiteboard space for students to collaboratively define and work on problems that are open-ended and that encourage students to define the questions themselves. We draw on the anthropological, psychological and sociological traditions and their concept of agency in order to produce a robust analysis of several segments of student work in the VMT Chat. Our analysis suggests that there are structural features to the VMT Chat environment that encourage ""agentic behavior"" on the part of students. This has important implications for learning and the structure of pedagogic activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Such a framework is important as a design process relevant to the work of CSCL. Any attempt trying to apply the traditional Instructional Design approaches (e.g., ADDIE) to social constructivist learning in CSCL contexts such as the community of learners approach is fundamentally flawed because the two stem from different assumptions of knowledge and philosophies of pedagogy. Based on a modified Activity Theory, we propose the ICAP (Identity, Community, Activity and Personal) design framework for social constructivist oriented approaches to educational design as an alternative to this mismatch. A case example of how ICAP is applied to designing a postgraduate degree program is reported.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper presents a theoretical framework for describing and understanding the processes which lead to collaborative knowledge building. The model borrows from the systemic approach of Luhmann as well as from Piaget's theory of equilibration. It describes people's learning activities as processes of externalization and internalization. Individual learning happens through internal processes of assimilation and accommodation, whereas changes in a wiki's information space are due to activities of external assimilation and external accommodation. All these equilibration activities are caused by subjectively perceived differences between an individuals' knowledge space and the wiki's information space. Differences of medium level are considered to cause cognitive conflicts which activate the described processes of equilibration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:03Z (GMT).

Females more frequently made comments about wanting to be confident of their answers before they would attach their names.

This system is primarily directed to a human moderator and facilitating moderation, but might also help the students monitor their own interactions. At the heart of system are the inter-relations between an off-line AI analysis mechanism and an on- line monitoring module.

This is accompanied with specific benefits but also constraints. In computer-mediated peer-tutoring for example it is more difficult to construct mutual models, thus impairing collaborators grounding, audience design and coordination. In this paper `Knowledge Mirroring`, that is providing information about the partner's knowledge, is introduced as technological support developed to compensate for these problems. Effects of Knowledge Mirroring on audience design and knowledge acquisition are studied in a simulated peer-tutoring scenario with explaining as basic activity. Analysis of explanations revealed audience design with respect to usage of elaborations and references. Results regarding knowledge acquisition show that learners provided with Knowledge Mirroring were able to draw more inferences on information distributed across the learning material.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:04Z (GMT).

Yet, to achieve rich, interactive, and creative collaborative learning settings CSCL tools need new flexible, dynamic and lightweight metaphors. This design tension between social and technology-mediated coordination is difficult to resolve and worthy of close analysis. In this paper, we study such a tension through the use of the Group Scribbles (GS) CSCL tool, developed at SRI International, a GUI-based approach that enables the creation and enactment of lightweight CSCL scenarios. The potential of GS, as well as its limita- tions and possible extensions are studied in relation to design scripts based on Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns. Preliminary experiences in an authentic environment illustrate several facets of the design tension, such as the participants' workload and awareness, or the adaptation to emergent situations. On the other hand, this study points out the need for a new flexible architec- ture that complements Group Scribbles.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Analysis of a sample of 257 cheat sites resulted in typologies for both the cheats and sites in terms of quality and quantity of science content. A case study of an especially active cheat site and analysis of player-written articles in Whyville's newspaper illuminate the illegitimate and legitimate aspects of cheating in this virtual world. Implications of these findings as cultural artifacts of the game community and as guides for designing informal online learning activities are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:05Z (GMT).

This appreciation is demonstrated by their willingness to jot down notes during activities and later write articles for an online cooking ""magazine."" The online cooking magazine has the potential to support learning and development of disposition toward scientific reasoning in several ways. It provides a place to hang scaffolding that promotes recognizing what's been learned, what led to successes, and how science contributed to those successes. It also provides a context for knowledge building in which learners create concrete artifacts they can share outside of the Kitchen Science Investigators community.

The ways in which reality TV fans engage as media producers parallels the ways in which researchers who study other new media such as video games describe the rich discourse, enduring community, and media mixing required to participate in these settings (Ito, in press; Steinkuehler, 2006). I argue here that the characterization of these worlds as communities of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991), the dominant analytic framework for online communities, does not fully capture the way learning (and therefore becoming) happens in reality TV online communities and suggest ways to reframe this model. Finally, I propose directions for future research focused on understanding reality TV online fan communities as informal learning environments that require participants to engage in rich cognitive and sociocultural media literacy activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:07Z (GMT).

Four grand challenges large, worthy, and difficult tasks should occupy the attention of the CSCL community. Each is a frontier: a more visible and vibrant role for the tools and metaphors of the CSCL community in a troubled era of globalization; means for extending collaboration beyond cognitive models to a broader range of human experience; vitality in learning and collaboration through the life cycle; and unlocking group ""flow"" in the science of collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:08Z (GMT).

In this symposium, in accordance with the conference theme which encourages us to explore interrelations among individual and social cognition with technology, we would help illuminate this hidden agenda. We would take some closer looks at cutting-edge research on knowledge integration of learning outcomes from different classes, across formal and informal learning settings, and for longer time periods than usually taken up by learning science research. We would then propose to define a new set of learning goals as assuring the portability, dependability, and sustainability of learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:08Z (GMT).

Researchers are therefore aiming for a formalization of collaboration scripts on both a conceptual and a computational level. A recently developed framework allows to describe collaboration scripts using a small number of components (participants, activities, roles, resources and groups) and mechanisms (task distribution, group formation and sequencing). Based on these, a formal, graphical modelling tool has been developed and tested with several example scripts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:09Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

As a consequence, it is not possible to use them in authentic CSCL settings with real users. The goal of this European Research Team therefore is to utilize the synergies of experience in manual interaction analysis with computer-based analytical methods.

To better understand the gap this research characterizes the range of schoolteachers' online practices and the relation between their pedagogical perceptions and these practices. Two groups of teachers were studied: Novices and leaders in online instruction. Data-sources included interviews, researcher's journal and online activities developed by teachers. Findings indicate that leading teachers develop activities that better utilize the technology, require higher levels of thinking, better connect contents to student lives, and scaffold for rich artifacts. However, both groups scarcely utilize collaborative learning in their activities. We claim that this teacher-centered approach plays a critical role in preventing ""ordinary"" teachers from regular employment of online instruction. Only teachers who considered themselves ""online freaks"" were able to withstand the demands of this approach to online instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:10Z (GMT).

Familiarity may have an impact on online collaboration, because it may help group members to progress more quickly through the stages of group development, and may lead to higher group cohesion. It was therefore hypothesized that increased familiarity would lead to (a) more critical and exploratory group norms, (b) more positive perceptions of online communication and collaboration, (c) more efficient and positive collaboration, and (d) better group performance. To investigate these hypotheses, 105 secondary education students collaborated in groups of three. The results of this study indicate that familiarity led to more critical and exploratory group norm perceptions, and more positive perceptions of online communication and collaboration. Furthermore, in familiar groups students needed to devote less time regulating their task-related activities. On the other hand, no effect of familiarity on group performance was found.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:11Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper I present preliminary findings from a field study of five newcomers in a research and development laboratory. The findings show that to move from peripheral to full participation newcomers make use of both interpersonal and technological resources available within the organization. In addition to these resources, newcomers' participation trajectories depend on experiences that they bring with when they enter the organization. These experiences provide templates that influence and shape consequent participation. The findings also suggest that as newcomers participate in a community they influence oldtimers as well as established practices in that community, suggesting that a community of practice undergoes changes as a result of newcomer participation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:11Z (GMT).

We are revising our own online community software to support a particular sociotechnical pattern: the emergence of ""transcendent communities""--networks of participation that transcend collections of related but distinct communities. In order to understand such inter-community activity we have developed a theoretical analysis of the basis for individual action and how this action can lead to value for the larger community.

While this research tradition is substantive and meaningful in its own right, we propose a line of inquiry that seeks to understand computer-supported, large-scale collective dynamics: how large groups of interacting people leverage technology to create emergent organizations (knowledge, structures, norms, values, etc.) at the collective level that are not reducible to any individual, e.g., Wikipedia, online communities etc. How does learning emerge in such large-scale collectives? Understanding the interactional dynamics of large-scale collectives is a critical and an open research question especially in an increasingly participatory, inter-connected, media-convergent culture of today. Recent CSCL research has alluded to this; we, however, develop the case further in terms of what it means for how one conceives learning, as well as methodologies for seeking understandings of how learning emerges in these large-scale networks. In the final analysis, we leverage complexity theory to advance computational agent-based models (ABMs) as part of an integrated, iteratively-validated phenomenological-ABM inquiry cycle to understand emergent phenomenon from the ""bottom up"".","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:12Z (GMT).

Similarly, high (low) quality member contributions made earlier in a discussion did more good (harm) than those made later on. Both PI and differential impact of member contributions suggest a high sensitivity to early exchange; both significantly predicting the eventual group performance, as measured by solution quality. Consequently, eventual group performance could be predicted based on what happened in the first 30-40% of a discussion.

Results suggest that groups made consistent efforts at regulating their learning and engagement, but that the overall quality of group regulation varied.

Scripts have repeatedly proven useful for guiding learners to engage in specific roles and activities in CSCL environments. The effective mechanisms of scripts in stimulating cognitive and collaborative processes, however, are not yet well understood. Moreover, scripts have been shown to be somewhat inflexible to variations in needs across individual learners, specific groups, and classroom constellations. In this symposium, we present research on how scripts impact socio- cognitive processes. The symposium additionally focuses on how CSCL environments can be orchestrated through flexible scripts that adapt to meet the special requirements at the classroom, small group, and individual levels.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:14Z (GMT).

The creation of these structures is deeply linked to notions of trust, which has been identified as a major factor in the behaviour of successful virtual teams. Because (virtual) teams are complex, the types of interactions that suit a particular team may or may not be predictable. The first author has created Phreda, software that permits group members to create interaction rules in the form of production rules. These rules are then given to an expert system shell that matches these rules against resource use parameters in the group's online collaboration environment.

When augmenting the classroom with handheld, wireless computing devices, handling peripheral participation becomes more difficult. The proposed new handheld network service, Look, allows a late overhearer, who has not witnessed the creation of common ground, to monitor the interaction between group members already engaged in a collaborative situated learning without interrupting. Laboratory experiences with our prototypes indicate that Look balances lightweight implementation, ease of use, and utility in a way that could enhance classroom communication and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:15Z (GMT).

As a prototypical situation of computer-supported information exchange, a shared- database setting was chosen for the current study. This information-exchange situation represented a social dilemma: while the contribution of information to a shared database induced costs and provided no benefit for the individual, the entire group suffered when all members decided to withhold information. In order to alleviate the information-exchange dilemma, a group-awareness tool was employed. It was hypothesized that participants would use group awareness for self- presentational purposes. For the examination of this assumption, the personality variable `protective self-presentation' (PSP) was measured. An interaction effect of group awareness and PSP was found: when an awareness tool provided information concerning the contribution behavior of each individual, this tool was used as a self-presentation opportunity. In order to understand this effect in more detail, single items of the PSP-scale were analyzed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Learners were asked to learn a theory individually before working on a task cooperatively. Altogether, 52 triads were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 (with/without script) x 2 (with/without content scheme)-factorial design. To measure the effects of the intervention, the argumentation in the learning discourse and in the task solutions was analyzed. Results show no effects of the script on transactive reactions, but small effects of the content scheme. The content scheme also influenced the construction of arguments with justifications positively. Justifications in task solutions were supported by script and content scheme.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The model provides an integrated theoretical framework to support empirical examination of interactions among humans, and among humans and their cultural tools--in particular, their technological tools.

Productive discussions could be resulted even without the assistance of teachers, through the problematizing moves made by the students themselves. Students having more experience in knowledge building seemed to be better at initiating the problematizing moves. However, the initiation also requires the uptakes of other learners so that the inquiry could be sustained. There was evidence that the novice group learned to ask more questions in the discussions, but their questions could still not be qualified as problematizing moves, suggesting further guidance might be needed. Relevant issues such as culture, gender, and the concept of ""group"" in a CSCL context were also discussed in this paper.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:17Z (GMT).

The current study advances our research by applying our methodology to pedagogy research: we investigate individual and social factors underlying outcomes of implementing collaborative- inquiry classroom practice. Using bifocal modeling (Blikstein &amp; Wilensky, 2006a), we juxtapose agent-based simulations of collaborative problem solving with real-classroom data of students' collaboration in a demographically diverse middle-school mathematics classroom (Abrahamson &amp; Wilensky, 2005b). We validate the computer model by comparing outcomes from running the simulation with outcomes of the real intervention. Findings are that collaboration pedagogy emphasizing group performance may forsake individual learning, because stable division-of-labor patterns emerge due to utilitarian preference of short-term production over long-term learning (Axelrod, 1997). The study may inform professional development and pedagogical policy (see interactive applet: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/research/conferences/CSCL2007/CSCL2007.html).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:20Z (GMT).

This article's goal is to propose such relations for a situation of collaborative design, mediated by computer and carried out at a distance. We will show two main relations that emerged from our corpus. Firstly, dialogue utterances between partners that have a dominant social aspect are positively related to the symmetry of the entire dyadic interaction in terms of partners' contributions. Secondly, dialogue utterances that predominantly deal with expressing what partners are doing is negatively related to the extent to which partners are aligned.

We discuss these functionalities in relation to ethnomethodological work on learning-and-instruction, showing how wiki entries were used as references in students' and teachers' talk. Distributed activities were thereby made available for instructive practices, and the competencies involved in note taking and observation could be collaboratively oriented to. We thus show that although the wiki was a web based distributed tool, its primary pedagogical functionality lay in its being used as a resource in co- located face-to-face talk.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:21Z (GMT).

We analyze the relationships between students' design notebooks, questionnaires, and interview responses, class observations, and course performance. Our study found that students' use of collaborative tools increases when they believe their teammates to be equally engaged and involved in the project. Moreover, students engaged in successful collaborations are likely to take fewer notes than those involved in conflict-filled collaborations, and students with considerable experience working in groups may bypass critical steps in creating joint problem-solving spaces with each new group.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:21Z (GMT).

Half of the participants faced a memory burden as they worked on an initial set of ten new patient diagnoses. Participants then taught a confederate how to perform diagnoses. Finally, two new diseases were introduced, and participants diagnosed five new patients. Participants were allowed to take notes throughout the study. Both the memory burden and the teaching demand led participants to create external representations. Representations used for initial diagnosis, but not for teaching, carried over into the final diagnosis set. Results show that creating a representation was initially inefficient, but led to better performance and learning when participants were asked to adapt to new diseases. Also, a much greater proportion of graduate students than undergraduates created representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A total of 39 dyads discussed the topic using either synchronous (chat) or asynchronous (discussion board) CMC, after which they collaboratively wrote an argumentative text in a synchronous groupware environment. It was hypothesized that synchronous CMC would stimulate deep argumentation because of feedback immediacy while asynchronous CMC would stimulate gathering arguments because it allows increased reflection time. Finally, the study sought to determine if students who argue well during a discussion also wrote better argumentative texts. The results obtained partly confirmed the expectations. Students using synchronous CMC argue in a more elaborated way than students using asynchronous CMC. However, in contrast to the hypothesis, students using asynchronous CMC produced more accurate argumentative texts. This study sheds light on how synchronous and asynchronous CMC will be suitable for specific collaborative learning processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:24Z (GMT).

To explain this, researchers have been suggested to investigate the interaction process occurring in the course of collaboration. Research on face-to-face (FTF) groups have provided clues as to what types of interaction are productive for learning, both at the individual and group level. However, the extent to which these findings apply to online groups is not yet clear. This paper reports a conceptual systematic review of recent studies of online synchronous learning groups. There is little evidence that the types of online interaction deemed favorable are actually associated with individual conceptual learning. These findings challenge the implicit assumption held by many educational technology designers.

Obviously, such conception of proving is/will be central in designing proof tasks, thus shaping the mathematical discourse around proof within classrooms. Whether one considers participation within such discourse is simply an aid or tantamount to thinking, identifying the character of this discourse appears to be essential in order to examine the interrelationships between what is social and what is individual.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:27Z (GMT).

The Complex Network Theory would be a promising approach to challenging this difficulty. We can visualize a variety of network structures with identifying ideas as nodes, and co-presence of words as links. Several indices numerically inform us how a target network is structured. In this paper, we report our attempt to describe how the network of ideas represented in discourse is structured in CSCL environments and its relation to the network structure analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:27Z (GMT).

In this research, 16 high school students varying in ability from low to high participated in a comparative assessment of geometry problem solving using: (1) pencil and paper, (2) an Anoto-based digital stylus and paper interface, (3) a pen tablet interface, and (4) a graphical tablet interface. Cognitive Load Theory correctly predicted that as interfaces departed more from familiar work practice, students experienced greater cognitive load and corresponding reductions in their expressive fluency and planning. The results of this study indicate that students' communication patterns and meta-cognitive control can be enhanced by pen-based interfaces dur- ing math problem solving activities. In addition, low-performing students do not automatically reap the same advantage as high performers when new interface tools are introduced, which means intervention may be required to avoid expanding the achievement gap between groups unless in- tervention is undertaken.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:28Z (GMT).

It is posited that marking schemes that focus on individual accomplishments may increase feelings of competition and undermine efforts to foster collaborative practices. To reduce the negative effects of competition, course instructors may need to develop assessment strategies that reward group, rather than individual, accomplishments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:29Z (GMT).

This is particularly problematic when collaboration and learning processes are studied in groups that work together over weeks, and months, as is increasingly the case. The quantitative method dominant in the social and learning sciences--variable-centered variance theory--is of limited value, so we argue, for studying change on longer time scales. We introduce event-centered process analysis as a more generally applicable approach, not only for quantitative analysis, but also for providing closer links between qualitative and quantitative research methods. We conclude with suggestions on how nomothetic, idiographic, and design-oriented research interests can become better integrated in CSCL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:30Z (GMT).

Additionally, process log files measuring individual and joint time and number of work phases were gathered, and joint solutions were analyzed. As had been assumed, the experts scored lower than the less experienced dyads in most measures of collaborative process. Looking in more detail at the less experienced dyads revealed that the trainee dyads outperformed the student dyads in most of the process variables.

The process of constructing this shared understanding requires that each team member builds some kind of representation of the behavior, beliefs, knowledge or intentions of other group members. In two empirical studies, we measured the accuracy of the mutual model, i.e. the difference between what A believes B knows, has done or intends to do and what B actually knows, has done or intends to do. In both studies, we found a significant correlation between the accuracy of A's model of B and the accuracy of B's model of A. This leads us to think that the process of modeling one's partners does not simply reflect individual attitudes or skills but emerges as a property of group interactions.

The analysis deals with a core issue for CSCL; the mismatch between common measures for learning, which are based on individual traits and outcomes, and learning processes that are distributed across people and artifacts. Rather than bridge this mismatch through an assessment of group performance, we suggest that learning scientists consider assessing an individual's adaptive reorganization in a socio-technical system. We selected video game play as a context for looking at collaborative learning because it represents an emergent social activity young people commonly engage in. Additionally, recent claims that game play involves deep learning have not been thoroughly investigated with ethnographic research; this project begins to address that gap.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:32Z (GMT).

The study consisted of two phases: Phase I for fostering a collaborative learning culture, and Phase II for using Knowledge Forum as a CSCL tool. Primary 3 students in one Singapore school participated in this study. Findings suggested that while students were motivated to learn in CSCL environments, they had difficulties monitoring and sharing knowledge for their own understanding. Additionally, a great deal of teacher guidance was needed to encourage student participation in collaborative knowledge building processes. Overall, this study may imply that students at this early stage of schooling need more structured guidance to improve their understanding in CSCL environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:33Z (GMT).

The collaborative construction of shared meaning is a complex process that has not previously been analyzed in detail despite the fact that it is often acknowledged as being the distinguishing element in CSCL. Here, a three-minute excerpt from a discussion among three students is considered in some detail. The students are reflecting on their analysis of mathematical patterns in a synchronous online environment with text chat and a shared whiteboard. Several interaction methods and group cognitive processes are identified. The analysis suggests a number of conditions and preconditions of such interaction. These are necessary for achieving the potential of CSCL as the accomplishment of high-order cognitive tasks by small groups of learners. An understanding of the conditions and preconditions of the small-group meaning-making process may aid in the design and analysis of CSCL activities, as well as in the development of a theory of group cognition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:33Z (GMT).

Better understanding of the content is supposed to improve the quality of argumentation in the discussions. Although plausible, empirical tests of these assumptions are sparse. Therefore, the goals of this study are to examine these assumptions and to provide analyses of cognitive processes during collaboration. A one-factorial design with forty-eight (48) participants was used to investigate the relation between the formal quality of single arguments (low vs. high) during online discussions of groups of three, cognitive processes, and knowledge acquisition. The formal quality of single arguments was fostered by means of a computer- supported collaboration script. Empirical evidence was found that the quality of argumentative knowledge construction during discussion is positively related to deep cognitive processing and that the scripted construction of single arguments had a positive effect on the individual acquisition of knowledge on argumentation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:34Z (GMT).

Building on recent analytic work within our laboratory, we propose a framework for analysis that is founded on the concepts of media coordinations and uptake, and utilizes an abstract transcript representation, the dependency graph, that is suitable for use by multiple analytical traditions and supports examination of sequential structure at larger scales.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:36Z (GMT).

Fifty-two high school students and 74 undergraduates completed a questionnaire on preference for argumentative texts or diagrams with different levels of difficulty. The high school students were also asked to construct texts and diagrams. Results show that preference for textual or diagrammatic representation depends on the level of difficulty of the represented information. The results suggest that learning with argumentative diagrams is only perceived to be beneficial with a medium level of information complexity. Sub optimal diagram construction in our previous studies on computer-supported collaborative learning may have been due to the complexity of the information.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:38Z (GMT).

It is hypothesized that the students will use the collaborative technology purely for task-related interactions when the characteristics of the tool closely match the conditions for an effective task performance. It is assumed that these task-related interactions stimulate knowledge elaboration and learning within the student group. Our findings indicate that all computer- mediated interactions were task-related and facilitated knowledge elaboration. Oral communication was about the social-emotional aspects of the collaboration, and the planning and regulation of the collaborative activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:39Z (GMT).

Our finding is that individuals brainstorming with VIBRANT produced more ideas than individuals who brainstormed with a human peer. However, an additional finding is that while brainstorming in pairs lead to short term process losses in terms of idea generation, with a corresponding reduction in learning in terms of pre to post test gains, it produced a productivity gain for a subsequent distinct individual inquiry task. Furthermore, automatically generated feedback from VIBRANT improved learning during idea generation but did not mitigate the process losses that were associated with reduced learning in the pairs conditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:41Z (GMT).

Accordingly, without further support, e. g. by distributed monitoring by a learning partner, fading may be ineffective. Therefore we examined whether fading fosters skill acquisition only in combination with collaborative support. In an expe- rimental study with the factors fading and distributed monitoring, learners were supported in an online discussion forum by a collaboration script for the production of counterarguments. Results show that fading fostered the acquisition of declarative knowledge about argumentation only in combination with distributed monitoring, whereas with regard to procedural knowledge about ar- gumentation there were no differences. These results indicate that fading supported by aspects of computer-supported collaboration can increase the effectiveness of fading for skill acquisition even in early stages of skill acquisition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:41Z (GMT).

In general, we found a high level of coordination throughout the chat logs. The level of goal-related coordination (goal-related vs. not goal-related) varied extensively, depending on the specific task type. Based on an initial process analysis, a time pattern with regard to coordination levels was identified. We surmised that the amount of goal-related coordination and the point in time in which it occurs might play a role in coordination behavior. However, strong intra- and interindividual differences prevented us from detecting a distinct coordination pattern by numerical means over time. We conclude by proposing an extension of our analysis across media type and task type to detect coordination patterns relevant for collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:41Z (GMT).

Main insights included a relatively low but stable continuity of individuals in the community, increasing international participation and increasing connectivity across different countries. Concerning the disciplines involved in CSCL and the disciplinary backgrounds of CSCL community members it was found that a variety of disciplines are represented in the community. A detailed analysis of the way these disciplines contribute to the progress of CSCL, the way members with different disciplinary backgrounds collaborate is still missing. In this paper we report an analysis of the CSCL community with respect to the disciplinary background of its members and the interrelation of various disciplines in CSCL. The analysis is based on a survey among members of the CSCL community actively involved in the CSCL 2007 conference (reviewers and authors of accepted contributions). The paper reports and discusses main results of this analysis with respect to disciplinary background of CSCL community members as well as links between the disciplines. In addition it provides insights into motives for interdisciplinary collaboration, beneficial and hindering factors. The results should help to sharpen our view of the CSCL community, contribute to a shared understanding about what CSCL (currently) is (and what is it not) and point out perspectives for future development of the CSCL community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:42Z (GMT).

To illustrate these principles, we present a scenario for small-group collaboration involving classroom device networks.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Teacher attrition results in part from frustration caused by inadequate preparation and lack of a professional development support system. Beginning teachers lack access to exemplars of effective teaching practices. This paper proposes a design framework addressing these problems via a free Internet-based resource for teachers to share videos of their teaching practices and exchange ideas through a supportive online community. This resource would present easily accessible videos of model practices, problem representations, problem solutions. The website would provide a supportive community for beginning teachers; enable them to: form groups centered on common interests, exchange messages, and offer one another feedback on teaching practices; facilitate sharing of classroom materials and best practices; and allow teachers to post profiles of professional and personal information.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:43Z (GMT).

Analysis of videotaped interactions and pre- and posttests clarified the following three points. (1) Students who used CarettaKids presented the simulation results and rules for object arrangement they worked out individually in their respective personal space, by using CarettaKids' function of projecting object arrangements and simulation results from a personal digital assistant onto a sensing board. (2) Many of the students who used CarettaKids examined individually generated ideas collaboratively in the shared space. The patterns of collaborative examination are: (a) Induce a rule for object arrangement from object arrangements devised in personal spaces; (b) Deduce a new object arrangement from the rules discovered in the personal spaces; and (c) Refine the rules discovered in the personal spaces through group discussion. (3) Students who used CarettaKids not only considered all of the three factors, i.e. residential area, industrial area and forest area, but also understood relations between these factors, thereby deepening their understanding of city planning that takes environmental and financial aspects into consideration. We suggest that the degree to which students deepen their understanding is affected by the presence or absence of collaborative examination of individually generated ideas in the shared space.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:44Z (GMT).

We apply dialogism to describe factors that contribute to students' perception of these classroom experiences as ones that do or do not foster collaboration, including the culture of the classroom, the affordances of the technologies used to mediate collaboration, and the role of multivocality in the classroom. Students are using, reusing, and appropriating media in creative ways outside of their school settings while teachers are increasingly incorporating related emerging technologies such as wikis, blogs, and chat rooms into their classrooms. By understanding the factors that contribute to dialogism, educators will be better equipped to create classroom cultures and design environments to encourage collaboration among students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:44Z (GMT).

However, these activities have not been well investigated in CSCL research. We have studied information behavior of small groups of middle school students engaged in online math problem solving. More specifically, we examined how participants negotiate and co- construct their information needs, how they seek information, and how they make sense of discovered information. We argue that for learners in a CSCL environment, information is essentially a social achievement that emerges through the interactions of the group. Information only becomes information for participants when it is interactionally constructed to be meaningful and intelligible in their local situation. Analyzing learners' information behavior from such an interactional perspective can help us understand their practices of doing collaboration and learning. This has significant implications for designing CSCL environments and information resources to support small groups' information behavior and collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:46Z (GMT).
