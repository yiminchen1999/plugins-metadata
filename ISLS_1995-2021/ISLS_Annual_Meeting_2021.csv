Researchers constructed a parsimonious epistemic network that was supported by in-depth qualitative interpretations to a) visualize students’ general trends of student self-reflection across the course experience and b) highlight which Projective Reflection constructs were highly nascent to participants as they engaged in identity exploration. Results further theoretical understandings of how courses designed to support identity exploration influence the sophistication and content of learners’ reflections on the self and illustrate the utility of epistemic networks for visualizing identity exploration trajectories over time","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:24Z (GMT).

The completion rate and completion quality of group activities were analyzed. Except for CKC activities, PI and CSW had a satisfactory completion quality. We analyzed the impact of group activities on students’ epistemological beliefs about learning communities, and also performed content analyses of students’ ideas and artifacts, to show the reciprocal influence between the community and small groups. Results show students had a significant agreement that the whole community is an important source for learning.

Self and others’ emotions and their consequences are crucial in social interactions but may be overlooked during collaborative problem-solving, as group members may highly focus on the processing of task information. Therefore, some authors have suggested that collaboration can benefit from explicit mutual sharing of emotions. However, other authors also argue that the beneficial effects of emotion sharing depend on the individuals’ dispositions to use emotions to change behaviors. This study explores how these two aspects influence how group members perceive their relationship during collaborative problem-solving. Results show that people with lower dispositions to regulate emotions improve their perception of equality, receptivity and productivity when they share emotions explicitly.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:25Z (GMT).

To investigate these points, this study considered two learning dyads working on a jigsaw-like task, wherein leaners explained a psychological theory by generating a concept map. The learners worked by showing each other's concept map prior to the task. Two eye-trackers were used to analyze how dyads looked at each other's concept map. The results show that learners receiving facilitation prompts exhibited the gaze behavior of reconsidering each other's concept map while making explanations. Additionally, learners who were using prompts when giving argumentative and conflicting suggestions exhibited a higher tendency to take other's different perspectives.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:26Z (GMT).

Their final poster presentations were assessed as learning outcomes. To identify idea improvement, socio-semantic network analysis was applied to the CSCL discourse. Their discourse topics were identified through clustering analysis of the temporal changes in the degree centralities of word networks. Finally, multi-regression analyses were performed to develop models to predict learning outcomes and regulation development from discourse topics. Results revealed that the learning outcome was higher when learners engaged in the appropriate idea improvement and that learners’ collaboration regulation develops through their engagement in collaborative monitoring.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:27Z (GMT).

Thus far, no clear definition for a turn has been provided in this context. This paper proposes that a turn be defined as an instance of writing that begins with the first character contributed by a member and ends with the last character of an uninterrupted string of text contributed by the same member or by the end of the document. A computer system was developed in order to automatically calculate the number of turns within a text. This turn-taking data will be of use to practitioners who strive to encourage high levels of written interaction among members of collaborative writing groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:27Z (GMT).

Qualitative examination suggests that the students who received reminders had more balanced talk distribution than students who did not. We investigated this further by examining case studies of four pairs of students. We found that the two more balanced pairs often agreed with each other in regards to the positioning of their roles. The two pairs who were less balanced each had a student who disengaged from the task in their sessions.

Thus, we conducted an experimental study where participants went through the following phases prescribed by a CSCL-script: after reading a text learners prepared individually by answering a task in written form, read the co-learner´s task answer, and subsequently discussed the text via chat. According to experimental condition, the preparation phases consisted of either non-generative, compare-and-contrast, or explanation tasks. Results revealed no overall effect of preparation task type on interactive discussion activities. However, generative preparation tasks affected interactive activities indirectly through the learners’ and their co-learners’ generative preparation activities. This suggests generative tasks can foster interactive discussion as far as the dyad partners actually enact generative preparation activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:28Z (GMT).

If learners are frustrated with the collaboration they are prone to reducing their participation or even exiting the learning setting. As collaborative learning can only be effective if all group members interact with each other, frustrating interaction patterns pose a challenge to the effectiveness of collaborative learning. We compiled a library consisting of 14 potentially frustrating interaction patterns through a literature-review and an analysis of collaboration data (n = 10 groups). Conducting an online survey among university students (n = 100) revealed that social loafing, deadline rush, ineffective communication, and unequal participation are the most severe interaction patterns.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:28Z (GMT).

By aid of an online questionnaire, we therefore asked N = 71 international experts from research on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) to assess for individual problem types to what extent they felt that different regulatory strategies would be immediately effective or not. As a result of the analysis of the respective median for the individual strategies, it became apparent that, according to the experts, primarily but not exclusively comprehension problems should be regulated with cognitive strategies, coordination problems with metacognitive strategies, motivation problems with motivational strategies and resource problems with resource-oriented strategies.

Our evaluation is situated in a team project that is part of an advanced software engineering course. In this course, students who possess foundational domain knowledge but are learning new concepts engage alternatively in programming followed by worked example-based reflection. They are either allowed to finish programming or are curtailed after a pre-specified time to participate in a longer worked example-based reflection. We find significant pre- to post-test learning gains in both conditions. Then, we not only find significantly more learning when students participated in longer worked example-based reflections but also a significant performance improvement on a problem-solving transfer task. These findings suggest that domain experts learning new concepts benefit more from worked example-based reflections than from problem-solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:30Z (GMT).

At universities, group work constantly leads to dissatisfaction among participants in collaborative groups and often influences the outcome of their work. In this study, we tested different settings, which can influence the contribution of members in blended learning courses in higher education. We used a questionnaire, asking for the assessment of one's own and that of the group members contribution, conducted at two points of the course. In addition, the members of certain groups were asked to give reciprocal feedback in the middle of the course. Additionally we used log files for the evaluation of the activities in the Learning Management System. Groups with reciprocal feedback initially rated the participation of members higher and reduced their rating in the end. Without reciprocal feedback, participants rated the contribution of their group members higher at the end than during the course. The perceived own contribution increased over time across all groups. The actual activities, measured through log data from the Learning Management System showed that self built groups with reciprocal feedback exhibit lower participation in the online environment. The grounding effect is evident across all groups; the activities in the Learning Management System have strongly decreased during the courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:30Z (GMT).

Given that prior investigations on LA-supported CSCL largely focused on university classrooms, implementation of LA for facilitating wiki-based CSCL environments in primary education is rarely explored. The focus on school-aged children also brings about the consideration of their parents’ attitudes. This study aims to examine primary school students’ experience of LA-supported CSCL and how their self-perceived parents’ attitudes towards their use of digital technology influence their learning experience. Survey, wiki logs and interview data were collected from 46 students and three teachers involved in LA-supported wiki-based group inquiry projects. Results show that after receiving LA support, students’ perceptions of inquiry-based learning and those of wiki-supported learning improved while they were less positive towards collaborative learning. In the meantime, it is found that, from students’ perspective, their parents’ awareness of the purpose of their mobile usage was negatively correlated with students’ participation on wiki. Discussion and implications were drawn.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:31Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The activities combined generic and domain-specific skills practices in different ways. We analyze how these two modes intertwine and argue that the teaching model we used can bridge the gap between learning in and out school. Key concepts used in the analysis are intersubjectivity, tension, and temporality. Our findings indicate that through Minecraft pupils, teachers, and amateur historians contribute to intersubjectivity toward shared knowledge by setting and releasing tensions between generic and domain specific knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:34Z (GMT).

Knowledge building analytics was developed to empower learners’ epistemic agency and support paths of idea improvement (Chen & Zhang 2016) but it was not explicitly designed to support teachers and students to develop ideas beyond the fulfillment of a prescribed curriculum. In this paper, we report the iterations of design of a set of analytics that compared keywords from Knowledge Forum (KF) notes against keywords mined from an expanded curriculum mapped across different grade years and topics. We termed the analytics, Curriculum-ideas-Analytics (CiA). Preliminary findings show that the balance between curriculum and students’ ideas is not easy navigation. Still, there is much potential in this design to support teachers to consider students’ diverse and seemingly naive ideas about big ideas embedded within the curriculum and better facilitate the identification of new lines of inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:37Z (GMT).

Unlike research on basic control tools that has revealed positive impacts on learning, research on enhanced tools is still rare and conflicting. It is thus open, whether the tools support generative interested learning or put too much extrinsic cognitive load onto learners. In the present study, we investigated the effects of video annotation and hyperlinking tools on learning success and cognitive load by analyzing tool-related interaction behavior data of 141 university students. Results indicated that the frequent use of enhanced video tools positively predicted learning success and a decrease in cognitive load.

As online education becomes increasingly common, there is a need to adapt Invention activities to the asynchronous nature of many courses. We do so in the context of an introductory undergraduate data science course. Using an online programming environment, students work on the tasks in pairs, without instructor support. We analyze the invention process and outcomes from two Invention activities on the challenging topics of classification and clustering. Detailed analysis of recordings of six student pairs shows how activity design supports insights at three levels: nature of models (e.g., the need to normalize); domain concepts (e.g., types of errors), and procedural solutions (e.g., weighting errors). We describe the activities, their design, and their outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper examines a dialogue corpus of 18 pairs of middle school students as they engage in block-based coding activities. We tagged the corpus with a collaborative dialogue act taxonomy and identified sequences of one to two dialogue acts (n-grams) that are significantly associated with partner satisfaction during collaborative learning. Six n-grams were found to be significant predictors: n-grams that were positively associated with satisfaction included some questions and clarifications. In contrast, n-grams that were negatively associated with satisfaction included off-task utterances, pairs of consecutive questions, and unexpectedly, positive feedback. These findings contribute to our understanding of how learners prefer to interact with their partners and how that interaction impacts collaborative experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:39Z (GMT).

To realize this potential, students need to gain control over their knowledge advancement in terms of adapting collaborative goals and reinventing their inquiry practices as problems evolve temporally. To this purpose, we consider the teacher scaffolding moves in turning higher levels of agency to students and enhancing their shared regulation of the inquiry. Going beyond existing research on scaffolding, the study examines such moves to see how teacher support plays out to help the classroom community co-construct, adapt and expand collective inquiry structures and trajectories. We explore this role in the context of a classroom of fourth-graders investigating light using knowledge building pedagogy and technology. Qualitative analysis of classroom discourse and teacher reflection identifies patterns of interaction by which the teacher leverages students’ emergent shared regulation.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:40Z (GMT).

Early models were able to achieve high reliability within restricted domains. More recent approaches have achieved a level of generality across learning domains. In this study, we investigate generalizability of models developed primarily in computer science courses to a new student population, namely, masters students in a leadership course, where we observe strikingly different patterns of transactive exchange than in prior studies. This difference prompted both a reformulation of the coding standards and innovation in the modeling approach, both of which we report on here.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:40Z (GMT).

We propose a complementary approach to joint visual attention by augmenting it with joint mental effort (JME). JME is computed as a cross-recurrence of the cognitive load of the peers in a dyad. We use data from 41 dyads to show the synergy between JVA and JME and the insights that they can shed in the collaborative process. The results show that in certain episodes of collaboration (characterized by the dialogue and division of labor strategy of the dyad) combining these two dual-eye tracking measures provide deeper insights about the collaborative processes and performance than JVA alone.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:41Z (GMT).

To learn effectively, emerging challenges need to be regulated successfully. This regulation is supposed to work best when problems are perceived homogeneously in the group, and when regulation strategies which immediately solve the problem are chosen and executed with sufficient intensity. We investigated what problems occur during collaborative online learning and how these are regulated by N=222 university students in 106 groups. We found that overall problem prevalence was low. Multilevel-modeling indicated that homogeneous problem perception—contrary to immediate and intensive strategy use—predicted subjective learning success, while objective learning success was not associated. Thus, in well-structured learning contexts, knowing what the problem is seems to be more important than knowing the best possible reaction to the problem. Students might be trained in problem perception in order to increase regulation competency.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:46:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Students of two German high schools were randomly assigned to one of three groups when reading expository texts. Subsequently, participants completed a posttest including retention and inference questions. An initial evaluation of the posttest data revealed no significant differences between the groups. This finding raised the question to what extent students actually carried out the requested learning activities and whether the quality of the performed learning activities plays an important role. The results indicate that qualitatively different learning activities are associated to different posttest performance. We conclude that explicitly examining traces of students’ learning activities might be a useful supplement in further research on generative learning activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:52:43Z (GMT).

We argue that creating domain-specific-blocks for modeling needs to be a thoughtfully designed process. This study investigates students' ideas while creating computational models for the phenomenon of diffusion. Seven 5th-grade students participated in individual sessions to observe an experiment and create a model to explain the experiment using domain-specific programming-blocks. Results illustrate that designing a model, coding, and translating ideas into computer-programs advance students' sensemaking about diffusion. Students' reasoning about particles' properties and behaviors evolved from a generic macro-level to a detailed micro-level description. Modeling using domain-specific-blocks is an excellent strategy to explore students' reasoning processes; translating ideas into code unpacks their thinking and reveals inadequate conceptions. There is a tension between the design of blocks and students' learning; a limited number of blocks might interfere with students' expressing their ideas, while the open endedness of the environment makes it hard to converge to an acceptable explanation. We argue that creating domain-specific blocks for modeling needs to be a thoughtful and carefully designed process.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:52:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Results suggest that early adolescents view peer relationships and friendships primarily as beneficial resources to support self-regulated learning and minimize the impact of competence and peer group concerns on learning, while friends were seen as particularly helpful for smoothing group interactions and promoting cohesion. Further, early adolescents distinguished between types of friends, with a focus on friends who would support group functioning.

In order to promote the ability to reason mechanistically in genetics, we should first understand what knowledge students need in order to be able to provide mechanistic explanations in this domain. In this study we interviewed undergraduate students studying toward a biological sciences degree and asked them to explain several complex genetic phenomena. We analyzed those interviews via two complementing perspectives – a mechanistic perspective and a cognitive perspective for domain-specific reasoning. We identified the type of domain specific knowledge used by students for reasoning and their use of domain general principles for mechanistic reasoning. We found that domain specific knowledge is used to operationalize domain general principals such as identifying and unpacking entities and linking between different parts of the suggested mechanism. We also found that domain-specific knowledge is used for re-visiting one’s own explanation.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:52:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Scholars participated in interviews regarding teaching and learning, attended learning sciences workshops, generated collaborative artifacts, and developed scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) projects. Preliminary analysis suggests changes in practice and understanding of relevant learning theories. Design moves for the second iteration will be discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:52:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Simultaneously, teachers must create learning environments that counteract inequities along intersecting axes of identity. But how do teachers learn teaching practices that both support student sensemaking via discourse and respond to issues of equity? We examine one method of in-service teacher learning: rehearsals, or approximations of practice. Building on emerging evidence from prior research, we explore the role of rehearsals in developing secondary science teachers’ adaptive expertise in facilitating equitable productive discussion. We analyze data from 17 “debrief” discussions that followed rehearsals, asking how shared knowledge 1) develops around discourse-centered science teaching and equity, and 2) is deployed in teachers’ adaptive expertise as they reconsider past practice. Preliminary results reveal the possibility of rehearsals and also highlight the need for clear scaffolding.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:52:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Drawing on these qualitative data, we present evidence for a conceptual challenge that may arise as youth develop understanding of AI: when considering how AI systems might use data to make decisions, students often began by drawing on prior experience to suggest underlying motivations within the decision space, rather than attending to features of the data themselves. We hypothesize that youth may begin with a working theory of AI that assumes general intelligence for the system, including the capacity to recognize and reason from human motivations.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:52:54Z (GMT).

Yet while teachers perceive using “authentic tools” in the classroom as providing an “authentic learning experience,” the power of computational tools to help reimagine existing content is often overlooked. Our team worked with teachers to co-design two CT-integrated statistics units across two years. We use a model of professional growth to discuss the teachers’ changing beliefs over the course of the two co-design projects. We see how the enactment of a programming-focused CT-integrated unit led to changes in teachers’ beliefs about the pedagogical impact of CT. These informed the teachers’ approach in a second co-design, resulting in a unit that emphasized empowering students to discover statistical concepts via an ​authentic learning experience​ using authentic computational tools.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:52:55Z (GMT).

It has been argued that the problem-solving processes prepare students for subsequent instruction. During problem solving, students are asked to generate multiple solutions to a novel problem. Yet, it is still unclear whether students actually need to generate solutions themselves to be prepared for learning from instruction or whether they could also receive solution examples and study those. Recent findings are mixed, requiring further analyses that investigate the preparatory processes during both types of activities. In this paper, we investigate students’ cognitive processes during generation and observation of solution attempts in order to better understand and design for the preparatory mechanisms in PS-I. We hypothesized that both activities would involve similar cognitive processes for the preparation of subsequent learning. Our results confirm this comparability, suggesting that similar preparatory processes are at work","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:00Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We present aconceptual framework that leverages these frames and introduces an emotional frame to acceleratebehavioral changes and the knowledge integration process of learning AEP (Linn & Elyon, 2011).Through a novel application of this conceptual framework, this research provides greater insightson mechanisms that motivate instructors to learn inclusive pedagogies, such as AEP.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:03Z (GMT).

Drawing on commognition, we found that dialogic engagement contributed to students’ learning in two ways. First, the students were able to correct their initial procedures; second, they were using their partner’s initial procedure as a stepping-stone to the deductive discourse. Our findings suggest that growth in mathematical discourses in collaborative learning may necessitate a specific kind of dialogic engagement that requires students to be able to question the meta-rules at the basis of discourses, to be selective in the steps they adopt and to actively make necessary adaptations. This kind of dialogic engagement may enable students to make critical transitions bolstered with a sense of ownership and agency.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:03Z (GMT).

The intentionality given to the co-design experience supported participants to see connections among meetings, professional contexts, and personal lives in new and expansive ways. As participants enacted learning across scales of practice, they were presented with new understandings of the content, and in turn designed a product that embodied expansive and compassionate learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:03Z (GMT).

We focus on two days of an eight-day mixed reality (MR) enhanced, embodied modeling curriculum where students play the roles of bees and flowers. We illustrate how the MR inquiry process supported students to take perspectives that they might not have otherwise. These different perspectives demonstrated a range of relationships to science and nature (e.g., friends, protectors, etc.). Our findings indicate that children disrupted traditional third-person views on scientific phenomena by taking the perspectives of and building empathy towards bees and flowers. Implications include the potential to further leverage perspective-taking and empathy-building towards desettling nature-culture relations (Bang et al., 2012) in future designs.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:04Z (GMT).

We discuss data from model construction tasks in a modeling-based unit in genetics. In this instruction, 11th grade students (n = 271) were provided five weeks of molecular genetics (n = 127) or classical genetics (n = 144), provided an assessment, which included the model construction task, and then moved to the alternate task.

While we have a sense of what it looks like for older learners to engage with CT, it is less clear what authentic CT practices look like for learners in K-5 classrooms. Part of the challenge of identifying CT in earlier grades is learners’ lack of prior experience with computing and limited language to describe computational processes and practices. This study provides insights into how young learners use gestures as they engage in a set of CT-enhanced mathematics activities. This work focuses on a fourth-grade mathematics activity in which learners work to control a spherical robot as it navigates a mathematical maze. Our analysis reveals various ways that learners use gesture to complement existing virtual and physical tools available for expressing and enacting CT concepts and practices. In doing so, this work suggests both methodological and pedagogical opportunities for understanding CT with younger learners and advances our understanding of the role of gesture and embodiment as a means of supporting young learners’ engagement with CT.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:05Z (GMT).

To support PF students’ development of failure awareness while learning in a non-STEM domain, this quasi-experimental study implemented and tested a cue-utilization activity prior to instruction. Our results show that PF students who experienced the cue-utilization activity still did not more critically evaluate their solution ideas and did not acquire more knowledge about social science research methods than their counterparts in a PF condition without cue-utilization activity. These results are discussed in light of students’ epistemological beliefs about social sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We found that people mostly increased their use of graphs, and that this explains an increase in their confidence to interpret graphs. People with stronger skills had a higher increase in graph use. People with weaker skills, also increased, rather than avoided, graph use.

Therefore, this study examines how learners’ prior knowledge and varying levels of autonomy (i.e., full versus partial) moderate the relationship between fixation durations over time on different information representations (i.e., books and research articles, conversations, posters) that are either considered relevant or irrelevant to the pre-test.

Results identified interaction effects between (1) fixation durations and representations on learning gains and (2) text relevance, type of representation, and relative game time as well as a moderating effect of autonomy.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:06Z (GMT).

Findings of this study demonstrate the importance of thinking critically about the boundary objects that are included in design that support students to make bridges between multiple disciplinary practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:08Z (GMT).

The PD sessions were structured as a set of participatory routines where the previous week's lesson was reviewed, the upcoming lesson was modeled, and then adaptations to it were discussed. Teacher discourse analyses during PD revealed three kinds of sense-making episodes (reflections, connections, suggestions). Analyses also showed that connection and suggestion episodes were frequently grounded in the board game, matching the intent of the instructional approach for supporting teacher learning. Finally, a majority of the suggestions made by teachers during PD were used during subsequent classroom enactments, indicating teachers’ reliance on each other despite their collective lack of experience teaching this content.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:08Z (GMT).

Twelve teachers were interviewed and asked to examine and select from side-by-side data sets the one that would provide a more authentic experience for students. Situating our work in the “Knowledge in Pieces” epistemology, we drew upon diSessa’s (1993) notion of an aesthetic – a knowledge system for appraisal and judgment. We examined what sensitivities were expressed and how judgments were made and supported. We observed that teachers drew upon at least three senses of authenticity to characterize and select data sets: authentic as messy, authentic as requiring more work, and authentic as involving computation. Identification of these ways of determining authenticity represents an initial step in better understanding how teachers appraise data that could be used in their teaching.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:09Z (GMT).

This practice emerged as both a collaborative practice of intentionally supporting colleagues’ concept development, as well as an oppositional practice that sought to combat more conservative colleagues by affirming peers they identified with and expanding on their argument. Theorizing distributed argumentation contributes to studies of democratic education and argumentation by exploring the interactional learning that happens beyond classrooms to build skill in engaging in democratic debate and politicization.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:09Z (GMT).

Middle school students are able to identify scientifically appropriate criteria for evaluating model goodness, but struggle to prioritize a key criterion: fit with evidence. Although many studies have explored students’ use of evidence, less is known about how students conceptualize the role of evidence in modeling, or reason about the importance of fit with evidence compared to other criteria. In this study we explored students’ conceptualizations of the relationship between evidence and models by analyzing students’ reasoning about criteria for good models. The results suggest that students conceptualize evidence in three ways: as a communication tool, as a way to determine accuracy, and as a way to determine accuracy mediated through inference. These findings can guide educators to facilitate classroom discussions that develop students’ understanding about the epistemic nature of evidence.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:10Z (GMT).

To do this I studied professional dancers who used their embodied practices to explore and choreograph mathematical ideas. I traced these dancers’ practice, physical research, from the dance studio to their participation in a double stimulation experiment in which they were asked to reenact mathematically salient choreography from a large-scale ensemble performance. This paper takes up recent methodological calls in the learning sciences to use the relational histories of learners in their embodied practices of disciplinary learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:10Z (GMT).

To study this learning process of designers, first, we draw on theories of disturbance-based learning and identify high-arousal moments, or high-learning potentials, by capitalizing on unobtrusive emotional arousal measures of vocal pitch and electrodermal activity. Next, designers’ learning at disturbance is characterized and understood through contextualization and triangulation with video observation and retrospective self-report using distributed views of learning. Together, our work shows how physiological measures such as voice could be integrated into the study of situated knowledge construction in the wild, and how the current mixed-methods approach offer new and more comprehensive ways of seeing and understanding knowledge in action.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:11Z (GMT).

An ordinal mixed-effects regression model showed that learners in the three conditions did not differ substantially in the quality of their revisions. An exploratory analysis indicates that whereas in the meta-cognitive condition the quality of learners’ revisions was not related to their domain-specific prior knowledge, in the content scaffold and control conditions learners with higher prior knowledge produced better revisions.

Providing effective communication strategies is critical in video lectures to reduce the physical gap between the tutors and learners for effective learning. Hence, the study presents empirical findings regarding the communication strategies of algebra tutors in online video lectures. We used two advanced psycholinguistic tools, Coh-Metrix and SÉANCE to investigate how the algebra tutors explored different language choices with specific sentimental values. In addition, the different teacher-talk strategies were identified within the level of their pedagogical discourse marker use. The results revealed the importance of linguistic and sentimental indices to understand the communication strategies of the tutors providing instruction on various algebra topics.  The findings further suggested that tutors tend to focus on providing intentional language cues in the form of pedagogical discourse markers to help build rapport with the learners in an online learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:12Z (GMT).

We address three main questions: (1) What learning partner roles did parents assume when schools transitioned to remote teaching and did they vary by family income level?; (2) How did these learning arrangements help families address the unique challenges they faced? and (3) Were there unexpected benefits? Our findings show how parents took on new roles by listening in on instruction, supervising learning, providing technical support, brokering connections, and collaborating.

We describe two approaches for looking at student responses, and analyze the affordances and constraints of each method.

Findings highlight similar and different ways these programs navigated organizational change by re-mediating their activity systems. This study extends previous work on organizational learning by illuminating relational bridging practices that facilitated expansive learning despite tensions, setbacks, and disturbances created as new work practices emerged in response to changing conditions. Through bridging practices, these programs developed co-constructed collective motives related to data use, common knowledge, distributed expertise, and a sense of collective agency and shared responsibility; these became cultural resources that supported expansive learning efforts.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:13Z (GMT).

N = 157 pre-service teachers were asked about their motivation to engage in evidence-informed reasoning and analyzed case scenarios of problematic teaching situations in an online learning environment. Structural equation modeling indicated that attainment value, descriptive normative beliefs, and self-efficacy were important prerequisites for the formation of intentions to engage in evidence-informed reasoning and the subjectively perceived behavior in order to solve classroom-related challenges. The findings suggest to help pre-service teachers carefully reflect and discuss what is part of the teacher role and their identification with this role.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:13Z (GMT).

In this paper, we discuss growth mindset practices that students exhibited in “Debugging by Design,” an intervention created to empower students in debugging—by designing e-textiles projects with bugs for their peers to solve. Drawing on observations of four student groups in a high school classroom over a period of eight hours, we examine the practices students exhibited that demonstrate the development of growth mindset, and the contexts where these practices emerged. We discuss how our design-focused, practice-first approach may be particularly well suited for promoting growth mindset in domains such as computer science.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:13Z (GMT).

Using multimodal interactional analysis, we demonstrate how a preschooler (aged 4) used both physical enactment (BS) and intense emotional involvement (ES) with precisely coordinated response cries (e.g., collaborative cheering, gasping) to make sense of how a continuous spatial route can be decomposed into discrete programmable steps.

Findings showed that students examined the model’s function most frequently, followed by structure then behavior. They spontaneously observed the model’s structural components, which at times led to more in-depth student-driven inquiries. Students attended to components’ behavior in the form of immediate situated feedback while demonstrating their conceptual understanding. Students compared and contrasted the multiple simulated states to elaborate on the model’s function. However, mental workload and prior knowledge were mediating factors.

The experimental group uses an agent-based model which characterizes Pattern, Agents, Interactions, Relations, and Causality (PAIR-C) features while the control group employs a commonly used PhET simulation. Although the pre-posttest does not capture significant differences between the two conditions, a set of non-leading prompt questions embedded in both simulation modules successfully captured the differences. Students from the experimental condition revealed fewer frequencies and categories of misconceptions and scored significantly higher in explaining one type of common misconceptions as well as responding to objective prompts than the control condition. Our finding indicates that the PAIR-C simulation module might have a better effect in reducing misconceptions. This study manifests strong potential in using a well-structured online simulation module to diagnose and address students’ misconceptions in learning natural selection.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:15Z (GMT).

We present the design and findings from the implementation of a fifth-grade investigation into the conservation of matter. We describe the process of how contradictions between representational systems surfaced and led to interlocking models.

Drawing on a definition from diSessa (1993) of an aesthetic as a loose knowledge system that operates in a data-driven manner, we highlight how such judgments appeared and functioned in the context of teachers selecting video clips from their own classrooms to share in an online professional development course. We describe a range of aesthetic judgments evident in this context to illustrate what aesthetics may involve and sound like in practice and to highlight domains in which teachers may draw on influential aesthetics.

This paper examines the extent to which the participants’ domain-specific knowledge of the already-learned topics of fraction multiplication and whole- number division can predict their creative transfer to the untaught topic of fraction division. The data suggests that prior knowledge of whole-number division and fraction multiplication contributed significantly to creative transfer performance. Further analysis indicated that for participants who had less exposure to fraction division, their creative transfer was predicted by procedural flexibility for whole-number division, conceptual knowledge and marginally by procedural knowledge for fraction multiplication.

Towards this goal, we designed anticipatory diagrammatic self-explanation, a novel form of self-explanation embedded in an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). In our ITS, anticipatory diagrammatic self-explanation scaffolds learners by providing visual representations to help learners predict an upcoming strategic step in algebra problem solving. A classroom experiment with 108 middle-school students found that anticipatory diagrammatic self-explanation helped students learn formal algebraic strategies and significantly improve their problem-solving performance. This study contributes to understanding of how self-explanation can be scaffolded to support learning and performance.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Initially, when participants realized they could customize the online curriculum, they developed feelings of ownership. Then, as participants deepened their understanding of the pedagogy, they began to use it to evaluate their own instruction. The trajectory culminated in participants connecting the pedagogy to student work from their own classroom. This led to a shift from focusing on remedies for misconceptions to seeking opportunities for building on students’ nascent ideas when customizing.

Quantitative results obtained from the semantic network analysis of word networks show collective knowledge advancement over time. Qualitative analyses of interviews and questionnaires reveal the developmental trajectory of students’ epistemic understanding started from idea-sharing to theory building, collective cognitive responsibility, and finally to progressive knowledge building. As indicated by further path analysis, students’ epistemic understanding of knowledge building predicted their Knowledge Forum interaction and depth of Knowledge Forum discourse, which in turn exerted influences on collective knowledge advancement and individual scientific understanding. This study sheds light on the design trajectory of knowledge building to promote epistemic changes and collective knowledge advancement.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:19Z (GMT).

Drawing on observational field notes, post-instruction debriefs and a retrospective interview, I identify five social practices of noticing – coding, highlighting, identifying, connecting and using knowledge. Three themes emerged to describe the potential and purpose of teacher noticing: legitimizing what student experiences “belong” in science class, normalizing the struggles faced by minoritized students during distance learning and bridging past and future lessons. My findings suggest that teacher noticing from in-person instruction does not translate to distance learning and that the practice of noticing must be re-imagined to support ambitious and equitable science teaching.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:20Z (GMT).

A major barrier to widespread CT integration is limited CT professional development (CT-PD). Given that, we drew on teacher professional development research to design and implement a fully unplugged CT-PD with inservice secondary science teachers that focused on unplugged strategies for integrating CT in core science curricula. We examined the influence of the CT-PD on teachers’ CT understanding and CT integration self-efficacy, as well as, program components that participants identified as particularly beneficial to their CT understanding and self-efficacy in CT/science integration.

It used a mixed-method approach. Its results indicated that there are three distinct discourse patterns related to CCR: (1) collective CCR, in which each group member engaged in discourse, (2) rotating leadership CCR, in which pairs of members flexibly engaged in discourse, and (3) fixed leadership CCR, in which a specific pair of group members led discursive activity. The study concludes by discussing which of these discourse patterns might help students develop and sustain CCR in collaborative problem-solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:21Z (GMT).

To investigate the factors contributing to this assumption, we document a comparative case analysis of the design processes of three studies centered on learning in communal spaces. All three studies shared the overarching objective of designing signage to promote playful learning opportunities in grocery stores, providing a rare opportunity to analyze different approaches to PD work in a controlled design area. We compare how three components interact throughout each design process: 1) researchers’ goals 2) researchers’ pedagogical frameworks and 3) community roles. We propose that future researchers consider the interplay of these three components as points of deliberation to formulate innovative and intentional PD practices. We offer a set of guidelines incorporating these components that researchers can reference when structuring their PD process.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:23Z (GMT).

We found that while the community of practice is strongly established within the physics department, students feel a weaker sense of community in their secondary departments, despite taking a similar quantity of classes in the other departments. The physics department has a strong community in part because of the activities of physics faculty: group work in classes, accessible research, and participation in scientific events. In this paper, we present narrated experiences of two case studies where we examine the nuances of their sense of community and the factors that strengthen the perceived physics community.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:24Z (GMT).

We captured knowledge sharing and individual construction by adapting a framework, a “function mechanism hierarchy”, and a dual-unit analysis at a group and individual level. The results indicate the reconciliation, that is, the students shared knowledge pieces while constructing their own knowledge, for which a coupling between the coarse-grained script and well-organized materials appeared responsible.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:24Z (GMT).

However, very little is known about how teachers adapt research articles, or how they justify decisions they make regarding these adaptations. In this study we analyzed in-service teachers’ justifications for decisions they made when adapting a scientific research article for their students, in the context of a methods course. Our research provides a “window” into teachers’ understanding of disciplinary literacy aspects, and provides critical insights that can be further used to develop better teacher professional development programs and teacher education.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:25Z (GMT).

Next, we describe the special design of a learning environment, called a humanistic knowledge building community, to explain how the interconnectedness of identities and knowledge can be supported to become an intentional facet of the knowledge building endeavor. Our findings and the resultant conceptualization extend broad views of learning that consider ways-of-knowing and being as intertwined, to show how the actual ideas that learners advance are also deeply entrenched with their ways-of-knowing and being.

We analyze a large collection of youth video production on youth-identified civic issues, specifically focusing on engagement around the “dual pandemic” of structural racism and COVID-19. Employing mixed-methods, we identified two emergent trends that shed light on intersections of quantification and youth civic production: 1) the paired usage of quantification and a human story, and 2) critiques of overgeneralization and totalizing quantification. This engagement reflects sophistication and awareness about the role of quantification and risks of over-reliance on quantification without deep human context. We offer implications for educators across disciplines, speaking to a core purpose of public education--critical and informed participation in democratic communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:25Z (GMT).

We focus on an activity in which students created choreography and modeled it in the programming environment NetLogo. The task was designed with the goal of creating opportunities for students to exercise agency and expressivity while coding. We analyze the extent to which incompatibilities, or moments of mismatch between what is possible in the dance versus NetLogo environments, shaped students’ agency and exploration. Our findings suggest that designing with incompatibilities positioned students with agency over their models and supported their own expressive goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:26Z (GMT).

One way to do this is by assisting PSTs in developing social empathy. This paper describes the design and implementation journey of three prototypes of a social justice in education instructional booklet that aims to engage PSTs in developing their social empathy through human-centered design (HCD) processes that aim to help them understand people from varied backgrounds and their unmet needs. Our prototypes were informed by a conceptualization of social empathy that encourages PSTs to understand people who come from different social backgrounds and findings from research that define concrete techniques to empathize with the users. We discuss the design and implementation of the fourth prototype of this booklet and propose a study to evaluate the impact of the booklet on PST’s development of social empathy.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:27Z (GMT).

Turn-usurping is one approach of turn-taking where a student usurps the floor which has been offered to another person by the last speaker. It reflects speaker’s strong agency in seeking for participation opportunities and hasn’t been fully explored in literature. The present explorative study adopted a mixed-method approach to examine major features and functions of turn-usurping in D-CPS. Participants were 168 primary school students who were assigned into 42 four-person groups to solve three open-process mathematical problems. Results showed that turn usurpers tended to have low intellectual status, low confidence in mathematics and high social anxiety. Turn-usurping had positive impact on maintaining participation equity and moving forward and complexifying group discussions. The findings suggested that it is practically  meaningful to promote an equitable interaction environment where each member is encouraged to freely jump in.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:27Z (GMT).

In this paper, we study the differences in student assessments of themselves and their assessments of others in response to particular programming moments. We analyze survey data from 214 CS1 students, finding that many have a self-critical bias, evaluating themselves more harshly than others. We also found that women have a stronger self-critical bias, and that students tend to be more self-critical when the other is female. These insights can help us reduce the impact of negative self-assessments on student experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Analysis of students' document maps revealed that most students were able to use the scaffold to appropriately evaluate documents' sources, represent the main claims that emerged from the documents, connect these claims to their respective sources, and identify agreements and disagreements between sources. However, some students focused more on constructing a highly elaborate representation of document claims, whereas other students focused more on integration of the documents through representation of the network of connections among sources and claims. These findings suggest a potential trade-off between elaboration and integration processes in multiple document comprehension that may require instructional attention and support.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:28Z (GMT).

Combining a gender sorting task and a mental rotation assessment, this study shows that students–regardless of gender–perceive consistent gender differences of everyday objects. Their ability to mentally rotate each object is related to their gender and the objects’ perceived gender. Females perform significantly higher on mental rotation tasks that involve objects that are perceived as feminine, matching scores of males. Yet, the stereotypical mental rotation differences between females and males are seen only on objects perceived as neither feminine nor masculine. The perceived gender of materials included in educational design may shape mental rotation ability.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:31Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Using grounded theory’s constant comparative method, video records of six teachers’ enactments of two lessons in an inquiry-based mathematics intervention course were content logged and analyzed with thematic, descriptive narrative memos. These were then coded to emergently identify teachers’ conceptual practices (CPs). Analysis of relationships between CPs illuminated four overarching FCs. Tellingly, the CP of building on student thinking was the only CP teachers enacted towards all four FCs. Better understanding what it means and what is needed to teach for inquiry in intervention courses can challenge back-to-basics approaches that cut off students’ opportunities for meaningful learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:31Z (GMT).

Our findings, focused on two pairs of third graders, demonstrated that students did not use complex programming commands when only playing; whereas, when supported through analysis of worked examples, they did use subroutines. Both pairs started to identify repeating patterns in their code once they had a worked example where a subroutine was used to repeat a set of commands. Yet, having time to play before analyzing worked examples in programming contexts may provide subtle benefits, especially for more abstract commands such as subroutines. Unlike prior studies, our findings suggest that looping concepts can be taught within the concept of subroutines, even with young students.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:31Z (GMT).

Database searches resulted in 2101 raw hits and an ultimate sample of 27 articles, predominantly in engineering education. We performed a content analysis to identify key assessment foci. The majority (20) included a focus on performance of the design, and a substantial number included a focus on communication (15) and scoping (11). While less prevalent, divergent thinking (9), creativity (9), convergent thinking (8), and collaboration (8) were also broadly represented.

In an attempt to bridge this gap and promote reflection of “disengaged” youth, we argue for embracing the more recent situative perspective on motivation. Further, we propose that tensions between authority and accountability in science education be examined in relation to power, arguing that connecting the situative perspective on motivation should be paired with a youth voice lens.

Nature of these actions are complex during representational problem solving as learners have to use or generate multiple representations for the purpose of seeking feedback. Our focus contrasts with the predominant approaches to develop learners’ feedback and representational competences as they are unsustainable and undermine the need to develop learners’ agency alongside those competences. Currently the question of under what conditions do individuals proactively seek feedback or when and how such actions contribute to specific learning is being investigated primarily in organizational studies. Therefore drawing from these studies, we adapt a well-established cost-value framework of feedback seeking by aligning it with the cultural historical activity theory. We then use this framework to examine how instructional conditions influence learners’ feedback seeking actions and the role of such actions in developing their representational competence.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:33Z (GMT).

We interpret the results as justification, disconfirmation and transparency being three distinct facets of diagnostic argumentation skills. We also assume that justification may relate to cross-domain transferable argumentation skills, while disconfirmation and transparency are rather context-specific aspects of diagnostic argumentation, relating to standards in diagnosing. Moreover, we discuss the type of reasoning and prior processing of the case as potential explanation for a correlation found between justification in diagnostic argumentation and the accuracy of diagnostic decisions.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:34Z (GMT).

Our analysis revealed similar and different ways of youth engaging in counterfactual reasoning in their comparisons. Students in the flood project compared actual and imagined economic data trends to show how a particular community fared after the flood, and the student in the family migration project compared actual data trends across cities to consider an imagined personal experience (how she might have grown up). We discuss how youth approached differences in their comparisons in order to connect to local or personal experiences and critique distributions of power.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:35Z (GMT).

We explore art as an accessible and personally relevant approach to developing middle school students’ data literacy. We designed and implemented a 2-week long arts-integrated unit in a grade 7 classroom.

We explore how we can use place-based learning to engage learners with diverse ways of knowing and being, particularly through transcending typical Western ideas of a separated human and nature relationship. In this short paper, we focus on how Naomi, a sixth-grade student, represented her class field trip experience and negotiated the human-nature relationship through restorying. Naomi’s restorying demonstrates the main characteristics of socioscientific perspective taking across different layers of her story. Further research is needed to understand how restorying impacts learners’ value orientations and supports socioscientific perspective taking.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:37Z (GMT).

While we know that youth-serving organizations are essential for youth learning and development, less is known about how those organizations are faring during this time. In this study, we present findings from a citywide survey of Chicago youth-serving organizations (N = 126) indicating that although there are challenges and needs resulting from the pandemic, there is also an important story of resilience and adaptation as the majority creatively shift their practices and engagement to the virtual space to continue to support youth and families in the communities they serve.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:40Z (GMT).

In this study, we analyze teacher conversations during the process of formative assessment co-design during a two-year professional development. We found heterogeneity in teachers’ contributions both within and across meetings as teachers engaged in co-design.

Models can help us understand and express how variability (in all its forms) plays into, is enacted during, and results from designed learning activities. Building models often requires employing multiple theories, methods, and design elements; a modeling stance recognizes that our research often elaborates a multi-level systems view. An explicit modeling stance may lead to developing descriptions of complex systems, inviting multi-stakeholder teamwork to improve these systems, integrating advances in learning analytics and educational data mining, and adding to ability of learning sciences research to tackle challenges at scale","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:41Z (GMT).

Most students identified the presence of programs in making these systems functional but struggled to account them structurally and behaviorally. A few students pointed out probable programming constructs in shaping underlying mechanisms, drawing from their prior programming experiences. To integrate these systems in computing education, we call for pedagogical designs to address the invisibility of computation—both of structural interconnections and of program execution.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:41Z (GMT).

Using a fine-grained grounded analysis, we identified theory-building moves in one student’s goal-directed modeling in a block-based microworld. We present moves organized into categories of building moves, testing moves, debugging moves, sense-making moves, and drawing on meta-knowledge. We then illustrate a number of the moves using a segment of transcript from the student’s theory-building activity, which was focused on modeling a flu epidemic.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:42Z (GMT).

Understanding how AKG manifests will help pave the way for further research on how various knowledge states influence the effectiveness of PS-I, facilitating the design of appropriate instructional interventions to promote desirable knowledge states. With twelve graduate students as participants, this study qualitatively analyzes conversational discourses of the problem-solving phase and finds that students spend most of their time solving problems and seldom evaluate their thoughts, while only a few express their experience of a knowledge gap. The authors suggest categories of knowledge states around AKG and the distinctive characteristics of each category.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our findings show that the frameworks that teachers bring to discussion shape what they notice about student contributions and thinking, their reasoning about what they notice, and how to support student learning. We use these findings to inform iterative design of personalized teacher professional development on facilitating science discussions.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:45Z (GMT).

Yet, we know very little about how children self-initiate and pursue making as hobbies and the value of such engagements as learning opportunities. To support STEM learning in relevant, familiar contexts for all interested children, we need to know the diverse experiences that support maker hobbies, including those not immediately apparent as STEM-rich (Bevan, 2014). I describe three young girls' doll makeover projects where they fix old dolls and make clothes and accessories for them as a maker hobby. Conceptualizing maker projects as representations, I examine the girls' practices as they give makeovers to old dolls throughout a summer break. Using a qualitative content analysis method, I identify Maker practices as a combination of STEM, literacy, social practices, and making as a hobby situated in the fabric of young girls' interests and contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:45Z (GMT).

This paper presents an exploratory study of how secondary school science teachers learn and use the content and skills of integrating data literacy into their curriculum, within the context of a PD program for bioinformatics. The findings suggest that there are a separate set of PCK components that teachers need to master in order to successfully teach data literacy, and that successful PD must support teachers in developing them.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:46Z (GMT).

A new survey of perceived expansive framing was completed by 6,452 fully online students as experimental items within the larger National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). Exploratory factor analysis uncovered five of the six intended factors in our 16-item survey and the internal consistency of the six scales ranged from 0.77 to 0.86. Significantly, one of our scales (Outside Places) was more highly correlated with the NSSE Perceived Learning scale (0.56) than any of the NSSE scales.

An emotional configurations perspective denaturalizes supposedly individual, internal, and discrete emotion states and instead foregrounds the ways that participants in social activity coordinate relationships between feeling, sense-making, and practice. In these four studies, we argue that emotionality should be more centrally interrogated in learning sciences research because it shapes what is learned and how learning unfolds, and itself becomes part of learning outcomes. The combined work makes theoretical contributions by interweaving emotion within sociocultural theories of learning and methodological contributions by sharing productive approaches to centering emotion as an object of analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:48Z (GMT).

These examples contribute to answering the question: How does simultaneously considering students’ and teachers’ embodied movements and social positioning offer new insights into studies of STEM classroom learning? Together, these studies show how different types of positioning are tightly related to one another, suggesting that more research is needed to understand the complex relationships between the physical, social, and epistemic positions in research and design of learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:51Z (GMT).

The methods were examined in relation to the degree of modality specificity they had with auditory and visuospatial working memory processing, via separate n-backs in each modality. The findings indicated the RTM may be modality specific. The RTM was found to have greater interference with auditory working memory processing compared to visuospatial processing. There was evidence the TDRT may be modality-unspecific, as the method had parallel interference with auditory and visuospatial working memory processing.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:53Z (GMT).

Research shows that individual solution attempts need to be addressed when comparing incorrect and correct solutions in the subsequent instruction phase. A computer-based implementation of a PS-I learning environment offers the possibility of adaptively addressing each individual’s solution type but also poses a double challenge: It requires an implementation that allows valid problem-solving processes and an accurate diagnosis of problem-solving results. These two challenges are influenced in opposite direction by the extend of openness of the learning environment: Structure restricts the problem-solving process, but eases the diagnosticity. We address these two challenges by investigating two learning environments with different extends of openness. As a first step, we focus one side of the double challenge: Are the problem-solving processes restricted or are they still valid in the more structured computer-based learning environment?","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:55Z (GMT).

In this work, we explore prompted self-explanation as a potential tool for assessing student efficacy in English grammar concepts with students undergoing a vocational training program. Using in-depth analysis of video recordings of students explaining concepts in English as a Second Language (ESL), we find that self-explanation (1) correlates with overall ESL assessment scores, hence can be a scalable assessment tool and (2) assists learners identify and correct errors, potentially useful as a learning tool.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:57Z (GMT).

However, until now research has mostly focused on applying top-down methodologies effectively aiming at replacing humans, i.e., using supervised machine learning to automate coding processes usually carried out by humans. However, this hinges on the assumption of scale effects and transferability of trained machine learning models across populations, two assumptions that may not hold, given the affordances of the learning sciences. This paper discusses the potentials and pitfalls of supervised and unsupervised machine learning for the learning sciences. We conclude that the true potential of machine learning does not lie in replacing humans but in supporting humans so that researchers can tap into new data sources and increase the validity of their findings.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:53:58Z (GMT).

We designed a standardized, simulated family conference, which provided new practice opportunities for over one hundred teacher candidates. We developed a performance rubric focused on key skills in family engagement that allows session transcripts to be scored using both human coders and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Using semantic similarity analysis, we piloted techniques for automating performance scoring. We also piloted protocols for providing performance feedback to candidates.

Results suggest that reciprocity and shared partnerships generally predicted how likely students might interact. We found differences in individual characteristics, for example, female students were as likely as male students to execute tasks, but less likely to engage in planning and monitoring exchange.

Learning genetics is difficult because it involves the need to reason about complex ideas and to link between mechanisms that occur at different levels of organization. Previous research in genetics education has studied either students’ understanding of inheritance patterns or their understandings of molecular genetics; very few studies have examined students’ understanding of the connection between these ideas. To address this gap, we conducted a cross-sectional interview study with students from middle school to high school, as well as undergraduate and graduate students, after they had experienced “status-quo” instruction in genetics. We analyzed student responses and described the molecular mechanistic explanations students used to explain inheritance patterns. Our findings allowed us to propose a progression describing the gradual use of genetics ideas. We discuss the implications of the tentative progression for instruction aimed at supporting reasoning in genetics.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Secondly, a clear distinction between these dimensions using the related indicators we identified. Finally, the dynamic aspect of engagement.

More specifically, the main and interactive effects of various risk and protective factors of parenting stress in relation to children’s engagement in homeschooling were examined. The number of weeks homeschooled and whether a child liked homeschooling were found to be significant factors in child engagement. Additionally, engagement was found to be optimized with a combination of low parent stress and high child liking of homeschooling. Results highlight the immediate impacts of prolonged school closure on parents and children and call for immediate support in addressing families’ needs during large public health crises.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:07Z (GMT).

There is, then, the potential for K-12 learners’ use of Bayesian methods, but this potential has not been widely recognized. In this article, we have two goals. First, we review prior research on Bayesian methods and learning, focusing on past research in developmental science, and—after finding limited past research—carrying out a systematic review of research in science education, statistics education, and the learning sciences. Second, we offer specific, targeted areas where we think that Bayesian methods could have an impact on learning sciences research.

The field, however, has under conceptualized how to foster implicit knowledge development in youth workers. Most learn experientially throughout their time in-service as they gain the skills and knowledge necessary to navigate complex dilemmas that arise in the field. I build on other scholars of youth work to argue that dilemmas crack open for the learner -- who in the case of this paper are novice youth workers -- tensions that exist at the nexus of their personal and professional identities. Structuring learning around ""dilemmas"" offers us a key pedagogical move that affords the field a framework from which to build novice youth workers capacity for new forms of recognition, flexibility, and adaptability. I take a case study approach to present how and what four novice youth workers learned in their experience with dilemmas of practice, which were leveraged as a pedagogical in a higher education course called Adolescent Development and Educational Psychology (ADEP).","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:12Z (GMT).

We conclude that (1) adapted instructional support enhances effects of simulations; (2) different strategies of adapting are effective for learners with different levels of prior knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:13Z (GMT).

How do fourth-grade students use representational fluency to engage in CT and mathematics using Sphero robots? To address this question, we observed two pairs of fourth-grade students who were engaged in programming the Sphero robot to navigate a prime number maze during a mathematics lesson. We found that the students used representational fluency to navigate concrete and abstract concepts. They used language and embodied gestures as forms of representational fluency to navigate the environment. Implications for this study are drawn for the design of CT activities that provide opportunities for the development of representational fluency to develop for young learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:18Z (GMT).

Therefore, adjustment strategies seem to have differential effects depending on learners’s prior knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:20Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper explores the affordances of a tool for critiquing classroom arguments in science, the Critical Questions Model of Argument Assessment, and how it benefited students with low English Language Arts (ELA) scores, including English Learners (ELs). Critical questions (CQs) evaluate the strength of scientific arguments. This paper presents a comparative case study of how middle-school science students used CQs in two classrooms with high numbers of students with low ELA scores. We found that asking CQs helped students elaborate their thinking and writing and appropriate argument-related terms. Student confidence for engaging in argument critique grew over the course of the school year. The practice of using peer critique with CQs may have the added benefit of differentiating instruction in schools with high EL populations. Overall, the CQs helped to scaffold more complex student discourse among students with low ELA scores.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The study focuses on the activity that took place between the initiation of the first search query and the actual instruction following. The results demonstrate a) the practices of selecting online instructional videos, and b) how these practices form trajectories of activity. The selection process was often extended involving several steps after the initial search term had been formulated. The study concludes with a discussion of how technical developments might support the search and selection of online videos produced for the learning and achievement of practical tasks.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-10-09T19:54:22Z (GMT).
