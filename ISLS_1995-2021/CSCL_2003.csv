5307836,"Allert, Heidrun||Richter, Christoph||Nejdl, Wolfgang",Extending the Scope of the Current Discussion on Metadata Towards Situated Models,The use of standardized metadata for describing educational resources is one of the ongoing issues in the field of computer-supported learning. While we face an extension from describing learning objects to the annotation of learning services current standards for educational metadata still focus on instructionalism at the cost of neglecting collaborative and cooperative aspects of learning. Therefore it becomes important to rethink the concepts underlying current standards of educational metadata. In this paper we propose a data model that allows to describe resources that might be used for learning purposes with respect to diverse learning theories including those which are relevant in the field of CSCL.,pp. 353-362,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/AllertRN03

Therefore computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is subjected to restrictions concerning the process of communication. The effects of nonverbal signs and their relevance in collaborative virtual environments are reported. An experimental study was performed to investigate the effects of the availability of nonverbal signs on the communication process, performance measures and subjective ratings regarding the 3D virtual environment and the communication. Differences concerning objective communication variables, such as number of interruptions, did not reach the level of statistical significance. Providing nonverbal signs in collaborative virtual environments, however, leads to higher motivation and a smoother communication process. The results are discussed with regard to CSCL applications.",pp. 431-440,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/AllmendingerTHS03

Students in upper secondary education had to discuss a topic in pairs, and write a collaborative argumentative text in an electronic environment. This was preceded by an individual phase in which students read information, and represented their individual opinion on the topic either in a text or in a diagram.

This paper describes a design experiment with a computer-mediated feedback system for promoting class interaction called the Classroom Feedback System (CFS). We delineate specific challenges to interaction and propose design principles to address them. CFS realizes these principles and establishes a computer-mediated channel for student-initiated feedback. Students position preset annotations (e.g., MORE EXPLANATION, GOT IT) directly on the lecture slides. CFS anonymizes the annotations and presents them to the instructor in real time. Successive experiments with paper and electronic prototypes validated our design and guided iterative refinement. Evidence from a large lecture study using the feedback system suggests that CFS increases levels of student-instructor interaction and addresses specific challenges to interaction.",pp. 119-123,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/AndersonAVWY03

We define a lifelong learning environment as an Internet based environment that supports self-directed, generative and intentional learning, where software elements assist the learner in planning her/his learning activities, in order to meet changing society demands, supporting her/him to collaborate in the social construction of knowledge in a virtual community. We discuss the design and implementation of CAS SIEL, a prototype of a lifelong learning environment developed based on the theory of knowledge creation by Nonaka and Takeuchi (Nonaka, 95). We present how this theory of knowledge creation in learning organizations, from the area of knowledge management, is suitable for constructing virtual communities of practice. We present how software agents support the diverse types of awareness required and allows the social construction of knowledge, based on a theory of knowledge management, proposing the design issues for lifelong learning environments on the Internet.",pp. 141-149,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/Ayala03

Participants shared observations and follow-up responses in five weekly rounds of data collection. Using a core-periphery social network analysis model, distinctive core and periphery sub-groups were found in each of the four listservs. As measured through quality assessments of individual observational messages, mean quality was higher in each of the core groups, but results were statistically non-significant. An asymmetric hypothesis, that periphery members sent more messages to the core than vice versa, was supported by data in three groups. Early submission of observations was highly correlated with number of messages received. Fitting the core-periphery model to data from three cumulative time periods, T1, T3, and T5, for each listserv, allowed us to check for consistency in group dynamics over time. For each listserv, it was found that the communications data progressively achieved a better fit with a core-periphery model.",pp. 313-322,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/BeckFP03

We sought (a) to examine how knowledge building portfolios can characterize and assess both individual and collective aspects of knowledge building; and (b) to investigate the roles of knowledge-building portfolios in fostering students’ conceptual understanding. The key design feature involves asking students to identify exemplary notes in the database illustrating collaborative knowledge building guided by four pedagogical knowledge building principles. We illustrate the design with results from two studies involving a graduate course in education and a Form 6 (Grade 12) course in physical geography. The results indicate that knowledge building portfolio scores are related to other knowledge building measures; and students producing knowledge building portfolios performed better than comparison students on conceptual understanding.,pp. 21-30,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/ChanA03

The CSCL environment we use, enables students to collaborate on a historical inquiry task and in writing an argumentative text. In order to support historical reasoning we compared two representational tools: a graphical representation (argumentative diagram) and a linear representation (argument list). As it is assumed that an argumentative diagram can support both cognitive and interaction processes, we expected that using this tool would result in more qualitative historical reasoning, in the chat as well as in the text. However, the results of this study did not show a significant difference in the amount and type of historical reasoning between the two conditions.

We do this in taking existing methodologies as our starting point. The central questions are: What methodologies do we have to examine complex phenomena within learning environments? How can the field meet the dual challenge of contributing to theory and practice? And to what extent and in what ways do existing methodologies reflect principles of scientific research? In pursuing these questions, we outline the principles of scientific research proposed by the National Research Council (2001). Then we apply these principles in an analysis of two prototypical methodologies that respond to the challenge of examining complex phenomena related to learning environments in situated practice. These methodologies are design research and the integrative research paradigm. These methodologies converge along some lines while differ on others. The focus of our comparative analysis is to articulate the underlying assumptions of these methodologies, to reconsider currently depicted dichotomies, and to develop a common language of principles for use-inspired basic research. As conclusions, three tasks are defined for future research practice: (1) becoming more explicit on method in scientific contributions, (2) specifying scientific standards for the field of complex learning environment research, and (3) developing complementary practical impact standards.",pp. 493-502,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/FischerBMG03

The model is based on a post-disciplinary approach to knowledge and educational design that sees any field of study in terms of the people who work in the area and who are seen to be members of its knowledge community. Drawing on these ideas, the networked environment is built as a collection of hyperlinks of representations of the field by recognized members of the knowledge community. A key feature of the model is the support of asynchronous reflective discussion among participants enabled through online learning sets.

5307859,"Hübscher-Younger, Teresa||Narayanan, N. Hari",Designing for Divergence,"Constructionist theories hold that learning will be deeper if students develop and share their own diverse understandings of a concept. College students are immersed in a community with its social norms, learning practices and an understanding of authority and the classroom contract. This situation makes it difficult for the students to have diverse understandings of a concept. This paper addresses how this affects the nature and diversity of representations students create for collaborative learning, and their perceptions of the quality of representations created by their peers. We redesigned and deployed a CSCL system with the goals of facilitating learning by leveraging students’ current collaborative learning practices and changing their perceptions of authority. We present summary results from two studies, which are part of an ongoing research program investigating these questions. In prior research we found that students have a strong sense of which style of representation is authoritative, and that this can lead to premature convergence and the suppression of alternative viewpoints. Results from the current studies indicate that creating, sharing and evaluating representations through a CSCL system improve learning. Furthermore, careful design of the CSCL system and learning activities can indeed lead to an increase in the diversity of created representations, avoiding some problems we saw previously with early convergence. However, authority still influences representational creation and evaluation.

5307871,"Martínez-Monés, Alejandra||Fuente, P. de la||Dimitriadis, Yannis A.",Towards an XML-Based Representation of Collaborative Action,"Interaction analysis is a core function for the support of coaching and evaluation in CSCL. It relies on information captured from the actions performed by the participants during the collaborative process. This information includes data of distinct nature and format, which demands a flexible and standardised data representation, adaptable to different analytical perspectives and collaborative situations. Besides this, it is known that the correct interpretation of human action needs to take context into account. We propose in this paper our approach towards the definition of an XML-based representation of source data, which includes a description of the context of collaboration, and offers a common representation for data of different origin and nature. It is extensible, and independent of the subsequent data analysis methods to which it might be applied. The paper also discusses the possibilities and limitations of XML as a representation language.",pp. 379-383,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/Martinez-MonesF03

In this paper a generalisation and modification of a concept, which has recently been suggested for engineering design, is discussed. The uniqueness of the proposed new breed of computer supported student contests arises from assessing tele-collaboration as part of the competition scoring. Recent web based contests are observed indicating that some early birds of the new breed may already exists. In addition to outlining the suggested generic methodology and some of its’ pedagogical and computer supported aspects, initial research activities towards scientific assessment of students’ tele-collaboration are reported. It is concluded that the concept presented here provides not only new education alternatives, but also some research possibilities in areas such as sociology, education, and engineering.",pp. 135-139,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/Moshaiov03

Moreover, subtle signals often stay unnoticed. In the current work, we focus on improving people's natural questioning behaviour in video-based design teams. We performed a quasi-experimental study to investigate if either a questioning tool or a facilitator stimulated reflective behaviour and therefore stimulated learning and understanding. We compared twenty teams that performed a complex design task; ten of these teams had next to audio and video support a questioning tool available. Preliminary results showed that perceived shared understanding increased over time, and that teams with both a facilitator and the tool understood each other best, which was in line with our hypotheses. On the other hand, we found that teams with neither a facilitator and nor the questioning tool posed most questions.",pp. 421-430,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/MulderGSK03

Two biology and chemistry related problem situations were presented to 21 biology and 18 chemistry class students of different schools. Students’ activity was scaffolded by an online tutor. The analogous problem situation was solved individually in the pre- and post-test. The process of design on whiteboard tool and the textual conversation on chat tool were recorded and the content was analysed from log-files. Based on the individuals’ external problem representations and the interactions recorded on whiteboards, the theoretical framework for the analysis of problem representations in science was created. According to this, the development of students’ problem representations must be supported on the dimensions of the ontological “objects” and “events” category components of mental models at the levels of everyday, scientific and scientific symbolic explanations. It was found that the collaborative modelling activity in the synchronous network environment caused the shift in students’ individual problem representations towards more complete and scientifically valid mental models.",pp. 189-198,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/PataS03

However, often students’ virtual and physical environments are not essentially separated. Likewise, scholars should become more sensitive to and aware of their research principles and practices guiding studies in virtual settings and especially, in the intersections of on- and offline contexts. The participant experience method discussed in this paper, grants access also to the events outside the virtual learning context connecting various social settings and simultaneous events. However, the use of participant experience methods requires critical reflection during its various phases and levels of implementation. Firstly, during the fieldwork, the relationship between researcher and researched should be reflected and the representation and reconstruction of these, often intense, field experiences into the field texts should be focused on. Secondly, the process and the inquiry that moulds the field documents into the research account should be highlighted. In order to represent both the researchers’ voices and the voices of the other social actors from the field, a multi-voiced analysis implemented as a split-text narrative is proposed.",pp. 451-460,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/PoysaMH03

With the influx of wireless technologies, new opportunities have been opened for designing novel computer-supported environments that support a wider range of collaborative interactions. For instance, collaboration can take on different forms, such as, adult-child collaboration or peer-peer collaboration, local or remote collaboration involving different forms of mobile communications. Moreover, depending on the type of collaboration, learners can experience a different kind of interaction, which can enable them to reflect in different ways. Using multiple collaborative interactions that facilitate diverse forms of reflection allows us to begin to explore the learning process in more detail. This paper presents a new conceptual framework for investigating and analysing how multiple collaborative interactions may support different forms of reflection. The framework is used here to analyse and inform the design of a novel mixed reality learning environment for children.

In this paper, we show that Social Network Analysis concepts, adapted to the collaborative distance-learning context, can help measuring the cohesion of small groups. Working on data extracted from a 10-week distance-learning experiment, we computed cohesion in several ways in order to highlight isolated people, active sub-groups and various roles of the members in the group communication structure. We argue that such processing, embodied in monitoring tools, can display global properties both at individual level and at group level and efficiently assist the tutor in following the collaboration within the group.

We identify two situations which discourage the emergence of the learning conversations taking place in threaded based tools. We are interested in, namely “interactional incoherence” and “sequential incoherence”. For each of these identified drawbacks, we conceive mechanisms which intend to surmount these incoherencies: first, the localization of topics in a message, based on the “what you answer is what you link” criteria; and second, a visualization that allows merging in a single view the time order and the thread order of the messages.

This ability to accumulate experiences over generations, and to communicate them in time and space, are two of the features that are so distinctive for the human species. A corollary of such a perspective on learning, and one that contrasts with most theoretical traditions, is that learning, and cognition in general, are historical phenomena subject to change in nature as the fabric of social practices changes, and as the mechanisms for storing and communicating information are transformed. Dewey recognised this sociohistorical contingency of cognition when pointing out that we have to rid ourselves “of the notion that “thinking” is a single, unalterable faculty” (1909/1997, p. 38). Already a hundred years ago, he argued in his vivid metaphorical language that “thinking is specific” and “not like a sausage machine which reduces all materials indifferently to one marketable commodity.” (p. 39).",pp. 1-2,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/Saljo03

An experience was developed which involved a paper-based ‘history hunt’ around a castle searching for clues about historical events that happened at the site. The clues involved people making drawings or rubbings on paper at a variety of locations. The paper was then electronically tagged and used to interact with a story tent. This consisted of a tarpaulin structure with projections on either side. A Radio Frequency ID tag reader and ultra violet light were positioned inside the tent. When placed on the tag reader, each paper clue revealed an historic 3D environment of the castle from the location at which the clue was found.’ secret writing’ revealed the story of a character at this location, while 2D images on the tent displayed corresponding scenes from this historical period. Visitors to the castle over 4 days took part in this experience.

An important role of shared representations in collaborative learning is to facilitate the ease of reference to previously introduced ideas. Complex ideas are more easily expressed when their component ideas can be indicated with simple gestures. Yet gesture does not have the same immediacy in typical online learning environments. We examined the extent to which gestural deixis is inhibited online, and how shared representations serve as conversational resources in other ways. Results show that gesture was almost never used online, and was partially replaced with verbal deixis and direct manipulation of the shared representation. Verbal deixis almost always referenced ideas already in the focus of attention, posing a potential problem for reflection on prior information. These results suggest the importance of better integration between communicative tools and shared representations and the inclusion of prompts for reflection.",pp. 173-182,Conference and Workshop Papers,https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/SuthersGH03
