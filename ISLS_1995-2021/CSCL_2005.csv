More specifically, on the interplay between collaborative creation of sketches (design proposals), and argumentation and negotiation processes taking place in the design activity. The question raised in this paper is how sketches produced during a design session reflect and mediate dialogues and argumentation in the design activity and how the sketches feed into an envisioned use context or vice versa. The concepts of action context- and target context representations are introduced and used to illustrate shifts of focus during a design session. We have studied a group of students working on a design task in an interactive space for two weeks. The purpose of the study was to investigate how an environment meant to support collaborative work and learning support collaborative and creative learning of interaction design. The results indicate that students attending a course on interaction design did not pay enough attention to target representations. Furthermore the results suggest that ""action context representations"" to a large extent occupy student activities as a result of either complex technology or as a result of the students thrust to do something instrumental. We suggest that pedagogical programs for collaborative learning of design may relieve some of the mapping, or interplay, of design proposals and the target context representation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:25:56Z (GMT).

In comparison with a hand-coded corpus coded with a 7 dimensional coding scheme, TagHelper is able to achieve an acceptable level of agreement (Cohen's Kappa of .7 or more) along 6 out of 7 of the dimensions when we commit only to the portion of the corpus where the predictor has the highest certainty. In 5 of those cases, the percentage of the corpus where the predictor is confident enough to commit a code is at least 88% of the corpus. Consequences for theory-building with respect to automatic corpus analysis are formulated. Potential applications as a support tool for process analyses, as real-time support for facilitators of on-line discussions, and for the development of more adaptive instructional support for computer-supported collaboration are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:25:57Z (GMT).

This situation presents a dilemma for designers of collaborative learning technologies: there is a need for representational and interactional tools that guide and support learning through cognitive and social activities, but predefined mappings between interface elements and functionalities may be too rigid. The study reported in this paper attempts to address this dilemma by identifying the strategies that people communicating via flexible written representations use to manage their interaction, and how they appropriate the affordances of media to carry out these strategies. We analyzed how people appropriated paper-based tools for collaboration under conditions approximating online interaction. Regularities were observed in the use of limited but polymorphic repertoires for communication and expression of attitude, functional and coordinative use of space, the presence of simultaneous threads, and strategies for interruption and context setting. The results suggest a new generation of collaborative technologies that include support for multi-faceted and parallel interactions, lightweight tools for expressing attitude, context representations, and scaffolding for automatically detecting and supporting emerging conventions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:25:57Z (GMT).

An empirical study was conducted using 159 university students. Students worked collaboratively in groups of three within a case-based videoconferencing learning environment and were supported by instructional support measures. Results indicated that collaborative knowledge construction had a greater impact on individual learning outcomes than an individual's prior knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:25:58Z (GMT).

We provided children with the ability to share and compare their data with children at their own and other schools. Our context- inclusive approach involved the design of tailored sensors and a bespoke interface displaying video data synchronised with environmental pollution data. Through evaluation of the data collection, analysis and sharing sessions, we describe how the context-inclusive approach impacts on children's understanding of the scientific process. We focus on children's discussion and reflection around understanding the constraints of measuring. We argue that the collection and presentation of contextual data engenders reflection on constraints, and may enable improved understanding of that process.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:25:58Z (GMT).

The study tested the effects of: (a) the use of shapes representing some argumentative functions in discussions and the use of arrows representing support/challenge between utterances; (b) the use of floor control to monitor turn taking during discussion. It appears that the combination of use of shapes and arrows and of the control over turn taking invites students to express more relevant claims and arguments, and less chat expressions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:25:59Z (GMT).

This study examines some reasons for this and outlines a conceptual and methodological framework for characterizing the engagement of experienced and novice teachers in informal network-based professional learning communities. I postulate sustainability to positively correlate with what I term ""CMC engagement."" This study addresses three key research questions: (1) What properties constitute CMC engagement in professional learning e-communities? (2) Why do some CMC groups sustain themselves, whereas others do not? (3) How might the communicative structures of network-based CMC enhance or constrain the development of their e-communities, and in turn, pertain to CMC engagement? I argue that both the dialogicality of utterances (Bakhtin, 1986) and the use of texts as ""thinking device[s]"" for generating new meanings (Lotman, 1990; Wertsch, 1991) are essential for engaging practitioners' professional life. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, longitudinal discursive data from public teacher email lists are subject to microgenetic, discourse, and ethnographic analyses, resulting in a novel taxonomy of e-communities and a characterization of CMC engagement. The findings provide a new formulation for sustainable learning in CMC- based professional teaching and learning environments, in both informal and formal settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:01Z (GMT).

A critical review of approaches to authenticity forms a major part of this paper, and a recommendation of a framework to scaffold learners from CoLs to CoPs with augmentation supports is recommended.

Research further indicates that student teachers' development of pedagogical content knowledge can be fostered if they are supported in reflecting on teaching experiences individually and cooperatively. Time and place independent pre- and in-service teacher training is gaining importance. Due to long distances between individual student teachers and the limited amount of time for reflection during face-to-face sessions, analysis and reflection processes cannot be realized in blended learning arrangements with the same means available in traditional face-to-face teacher education. The project ""v-share"" therefore develops the methodological concept and technical support for video-based analysis and reflection on teaching experiences in (virtual) groups. The internet-based tool allows student teachers in blended learning arrangements to share videos of their own and their fellow student teachers' teaching lessons and to select sequences for joint online analysis, annotation and reflection.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:01Z (GMT).

Discrepancies between student and instructor scores were explained by bias due to non-objective student personal stands. Refinements to the design, based on emerging design principles a) assisted students to better differentiate between objective criteria and personal opinions, b) increased learning gains, and c) decreased tensions between different cultural groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:02Z (GMT).

In this paper, we present a methodological framework for characterizing and analyzing these processes. We describe four measures that characterize genetic evolution - number, function, fitness, and persistence - to characterize the process of collaborative problem solving, and instantiate them in a study of problem-solving interactions of collaborative groups in an online, synchronous environment.

A focus is set on the continuity of active and passive membership, the geographical distribution and the international connectivity of the community. Contrary to our expectations, only a relatively small number of people participate continuously in the community. Concerning the geographical distribution we found that the community is increasingly international in conference participation, authors, and program committees. The international connectivity of the community is also increasing which can be seen in a growing number of citations and co-authorships across different countries. These results can serve as a basis for further cultivation of the CSCL community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Eliminating anonymity options produced significantly fewer antisocial comments and fewer comments overall, although it did not affect overall peripheral participation as measured by logins and page views.

To make such technologies effective, we support activities and teaching practices crucial to children's creativity and competence. However, because of the small screen size and distributed nature of some of the activities, it can be hard for teachers to engage in formative assessment, that is, finding out what students know and can do. The current work reports an idea about how to solve this problem and the first assays of this idea in the classroom. We try to enable what we call weak guidance during collaborative activities, by implementing a system feature called ""Look.""","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:04Z (GMT).

Measures included assembly speed and assembly accuracy and were recorded during instruction and post- instruction at 10min and 24hr intervals. Perceived Instructor presence and other interpersonal variables were assessed via questionnaire. Results showed that remote gesturing during instruction led to significantly faster self-assembly 24hrs post instruction (t (13) =1.73, p 0.05). Whilst the use of gesture reportedly reduces communicative rapport, we conclude that gesture-based remote instruction improves the overall efficiency of remote collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:05Z (GMT).

While the collaboration within groups was strong and successful in the first generation AR games, the collaboration between groups was limited or non-existent. Several new game play elements added to a new engine created a more dynamic game play experience. These features included time dependence, cascading events and distinct player roles.

The primary design goals were to engage visitors more deeply in the museum, engage visitors more broadly across museum exhibits, and encourage collaboration between visitors. The feedback from the participants suggested that the combination of depth and breadth was engaging and effective in encouraging them to think about the museum's exhibits. The roles that were an integral part of the game turned out to be extremely effective in engaging pairs of participants with one another. Feedback from parents was quite positive in terms of how they felt it engaged them and their children.

However, from a community-building perspective, social interaction is key to the sustainability of a learning community. An apparent paradox seems to exist in that, while social interaction is critical for community cohesion, social postings do not contribute to effective discussion. The authors argue that previous research using postings as the unit of analysis has failed to discover the context in which effective learning took place. Using threads as the unit of analysis, this study is able to explore empirically the relationship between effective discussion and social talks in CSCL environment. Based on an analysis of 321 longer threads (consisting of 10490 postings) in which the structure of the threads, the components of the threads, and the order of different categories of postings in some of these threads were defined, this study reveals that genuine effective discussions and social talks cannot be viewed in isolation nor does there exist a wall between them. The roles of social talks in CSCL are rediscovered and discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:06Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Two versions of an external collaboration script (high vs. low structured) supporting argumentation were embedded within a web-based collaborative inquiry curriculum. Students' internal scripts were classified as either high or low structured, establishing a 2x2-factorial design. Results suggest that the high structured external script supported all learners, regardless of their internal scripts, concerning the acquisition of domain-general knowledge. Learners' internal scripts influenced the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge. Results from two case studies reveal differences in argumentation processes attributable to the learners' internal scripts. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical relevance and practical implications for learning with collaboration scripts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:06Z (GMT).

This paper discusses the redesign of the CT for use in handheld or mobile devices. The key to mediating the generation of procedural knowledge of the addition of fractions with unlike denominators is the process of searching for common denominators in the GPM. A scenario for collaborative learning is depicted, and the distribution of the cognitive load of learners across the GPM and their collaborative learning partners is elaborated. Three essential structures that promote collaborative work are discussed, namely, task structure, incentive structure, and group motivation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:06Z (GMT).

These generally assess outcomes at the individual level though the learning context was clearly a social collaborative one. Recent studies on the characteristics of productive online collaborative discourse have identified features at the group/community level that cannot be sufficiently described at the individual level. Building on the theory of knowledge building (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 2003) as a social intentional activity, this paper proposes a model of assessing learning in CSCL contexts as group/community outcomes with four inter-related but distinct dimensions: a social dynamic for sharing and open exploration, a progressive inquiry orientation, a socio- metacognitive orientation and a communal habit of mind. An application of the model is reported and the implication of the findings is discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Conceptualised in this way, ethnomethodology and curricular design is a world apart. With a focus on ethnomethodology's take on analytical and normative questions, however, some ethnomethodological insights might play an interesting role in investigation as well as development of computer based learning environments. The discussion is structured around four analytical commitments: become vulgarly competent; be indifferent to formal analytic methods, not member concerns; focus on actions and immanent pedagogies, not learning; and, do hybrid studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:08Z (GMT).

Variations of the colearner's attributes, informed by research literature on human partners, are explored through an online testbed application of English language idioms. Results from an experimental study with 76 Japanese college students reveal that cooperative colearners have a positive impact on students' performance and experience, as well as increasing perceptions of the character's intelligence and credibility. Findings provide grounding for a fruitful new direction for pedagogical characters, where students learn alongside emotional companions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:10Z (GMT).

Our initial integration does not provide tutoring per se but rather acts as a means to capture data that provides the beginnings of a tutor for collaboration. Second, we have performed an initial study in which dyads of students used our software to collaborate in solving a classification / composition problem. This study uncovered five dimensions of analysis that our approach must use to help us better understand student collaborative behavior and lead to the eventual development of a Cognitive Tutor for collaboration.

Due to the experimental design it was not possible to judge the role of explicit referencing. Now we present the ""missing"" data: The higher learning score can be explained just by the explicit referencing. We argue that this is an important design issue for chat applications, because it seems that explicit referencing leads to a more homogeneous discourse behavior (more homogeneous participation, more participation in parallel discussion threads) and a better grounding.

However, we know little about how teachers or curriculum designers should design a course utilizing the project-based learning approach according to real-world activities. In this study, we investigate an undergraduate cognitive science course that combines CSCL classroom activities with observational project activities in educational fields. As a result we identified three requirements of a project-based learning design to promote integration between classroom knowledge and authentic field activities: 1) Parallel-structured course involving both disciplinary and project activities; 2) Reality of the project activities; and 3) accessibility of the project content. In the conclusion, we discuss how these findings should guide the development of CSCL-based, project-oriented courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

When such technology designed for individuals is applied to group learning, several student grouping problems could be encountered. In this paper, three issues are identified to illustrate the vision of the 1:2 educational computing environments. In a 1:2 classroom, besides the mobile devices, students also have their own computing desks, i.e. MatrixDesks, to solve the potential student grouping problems. By putting MatrixDesks together, a small group can form a shared working space with the combined desktops immediately and they can use their own digital pens as the input devices to work on and talk over it. Meanwhile, the students use their mobile devices to handle the related individual tasks. MatrixDesks is a coordination of applying the mobile computing and invisible computing to collaborative learning, which will lead to the accomplishment of 1:2 educational computing environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:13Z (GMT).

Similar tutor-supported and untutored science-related dilemma-solving activities in network-based synchronous mode were categorically analyzed and compared with respect to their scaffolding acts. We asked the question, whether there emerges the collaborative scaffolding situation in teams and how does tutor influence the peer scaffolding. Results indicated the presence of several scaffolding actors in collaborative teams. The nature of activity (tutored or untutored) had an influence on the practice of specific supportive acts by the tutor and the students. The various interrelations between student and tutor scaffolding acts must be considered when preparing the tutor support during problem solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:13Z (GMT).

The student teams are connected to each other and to their supervisors in academia and practice through a community-system. Moreover, the course is accompanied by a series of lectures and group discussions. In this paper we present empirical findings and reflect on changes in the design of the course which took place between its first and the second instantiation. These design changes were based on the empirical evaluation of the first course and a deeper analysis of the role of social capital.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:15Z (GMT).

Results indicate that students' attitude towards the learning environment and their engagement in the discussion group are significant predictors. No significant overall differences in students' mean levels of knowledge construction between the role and no role condition were observed. However, additional analyses revealed (1) that students in the role condition more often reached the highest level; and (2) that assigning students the role of summarizer resulted in significantly higher levels of knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:17Z (GMT).

After providing a formal definition of the metric, an exploratory analysis of interaction in two different settings is reported to determine the feasibility of the measure: synchronous interaction in a collaborative puzzle game and asynchronous interaction in student groups that use the BSCW shared workspace system.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:17Z (GMT).

The findings indicate that the grade four data are best described by an exponential model, and the teacher education data by an oscillatory model. We conclude that the method we discuss is potentially useful for understanding the development of reading practices in a CSCL community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:18Z (GMT).

We draw on work by Shaffer and Kaput (1999), Clark (2003), and Latour (1996a; 1996b; 1996c) to conduct a thought experiment, extending the analytical reach of activity theory (Nardi, 1996b), mediated action (Wertsch, 1998) and distributed cognition (Pea, 1993) by adopting a stronger form of the concepts of distribution and mediation in the context of cognitive activity. For rhetorical purposes, we posit this stronger form of the distribution of intelligence across persons and objects as a theory of distributed mind. Our purpose in describing a theory of distributed mind as an extension of (but not replacement for) extant sociocultural theories on this 10th anniversary of the International Conference on Computer Supported Collaborative Learning is to problematize for the field its current focus on human collaboration as supported by computers. We are concerned that a field focusing on the interactions of humans will overlook the ways in which meaningful cognitive (and therefore pedagogical) activity is distributed among human and non-human agents within activity systems. We argue that all computer-supported learning is fundamentally collaborative--whether or not the computer is supporting the interaction of persons in the learning process. The consequences of such a move are a call for a tighter integration of the fields of CSCL and HCI, and a more powerful framework to help guide pedagogical choices in an age marked by rapid expansion of powerful cognitive technologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:19Z (GMT).

This study critically reviewed and analyzed ten case studies to identify instructional goals, methods, effectiveness, and conditions of collaborative online learning. Twenty-three methods identified from the synthesis and comparison of cases were grouped into five categories representing commonalities: a) grouping, b) collaborative tasks, c) team-building, d) computer-mediated communication, and e) instructor. It appeared that while some methods are equally important for both face-to-face and computer- supported learning environments, instructional methods related to group composition, synchronous interaction, and communication modes are particularly critical for collaborative online learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:19Z (GMT).

However, assessing collaborative process is not easy. We have developed a new assessment method by quantitatively rating nine qualitatively defined characteristic dimensions of collaboration. In this paper, we first describe how these dimensions were extracted from video- recordings of dyads collaborating to solve interdisciplinary tasks. Then we explain how the resulting rating system was applied to and tested on another sample. Based on positive findings from this application, we argue that the new method can be recommended for different areas of CSCL research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:20Z (GMT).

The collaborative discourse is the agent of knowledge building that requires computer support and curriculum design.

Prescribed functional roles were implemented in half of all groups during a project-based course in higher education. All communication was via e-mail. Analysis of Likert-scale evaluation questionnaires gathered in both studies revealed a latent variable `perceived group efficiency' (PGE) which depending on the level of constraints set by preconditions appears to increase the awareness (Study 1) or the level of efficiency (Study 2). However, Likert-scales provide a surface level analysis of actual behaviour and no insight in the collaborative process. Hence, the e-mail communication was investigated with two content analysis procedures: content analysis of the type of communicative statements and analysis of the role behaviours performed in role and nonrole groups. Results from both studies reveal that significantly more statements are focused on coordination in role groups. In addition, analysis of role behaviour reveals that students in role groups perform significantly more according to the functional roles than their counterparts in nonrole groups, although spontaneous role behaviour emerged in nonrole groups as well.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:21Z (GMT).

The participants were 24 middle school students joined in an online learning community for a week. Two patterns of peer interactions such as in-degree and out-degree centrality were identified. Students with high intra-personal or verbal-linguistic intelligence were related to high in-degree centrality, while students with high interpersonal intelligence or prior knowledge were related to high out-degree centrality. That means ""self smart"" or ""word smart"" students were popular and played knowledge broker's roles in their community. On the other hand, ""social smart"" students or ""high prior knowledge"" students were open and friendly activators and delivered vast information. Moreover, higher peer interactions were related to better learning outcome. These results indicated that peer interactions were important intervening variables to enhance learning effect.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These qualities are also observed when children work with the augmented paper booklet. The value of digital content is demonstrated in a participatory design activity, where we find how digital media can `bring to life' the information presented on paper. In contrast to developments focused narrowly on new technologies, this study presents evidence for the use and value of paper, and paper augmented with digital media, in educational settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:22Z (GMT).

This ""Land/Water"" metaphor offers that virtual space is like land for virtual creatures, and real space is like water for them. The interaction paradigm involves groups of animated creatures that live on desktop screens, and may be transported from screen to screen by means of mobile Tablet PCs carried by human participants. This paper presents a working implementation of this paradigm and describes its use as an educational tool.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It reports on the development of such an instrument, the Collaborative Inquiry-based Project Questionnaire (CIPQ). Confirmatory factor analysis of the CIPQ data on six independent groups (n=269, 235, 173, 192, 300 and 254) of students who participated computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) projects has consistently yielded a five-factor model of motivation (Project Work, Social Learning, Task, Reinforcement and Social Pressure factors). The validity of CIPQ was indicated by the empirical relationship found between the five factor scores and independent measures of the levels of project engagement of the students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:23Z (GMT).

The unit of analysis was the group on KF. Students in two high school classes collaborated on a progressive inquiry exploring aspects of a recent SARS outbreak and some related topics. They were asked to write collaborative, co-authored, summary notes to make the nature and importance of the knowledge advances they achieved clear for their peers. The findings indicate that note ratings were positively related to the number of co-authors and the number of views (different discussion spaces) in which students had worked.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:24Z (GMT).

The computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) movement is critiqued for not always taking into account the radical implications of the concept of `dialogic' which is the idea that meaning-making requires the inter-animation of more than one perspective. It is argued that dialogue and dialogic is the key to `learning to learn' and other higher order thinking skills and that the unique features of ICT particularly suit it to inducting learners into learning dialogues and to the deepening and broadening of dialogues as an end in itself.

Both scripts were varied independently in a 2u2-factorial design. 120 students of Educational Science participated in the study in groups of three. Results show that the computer-supported scripts facilitate specific processes and outcomes of argumentative knowledge construction.

The most significant sub-narratives indicating unique student learning were identified through texts that were self-revelatory of critical moments in understanding (often labeled as ""aha's""). Important sequential and consequential events, as well as learning outcomes, were selected. Relevant texts were analyzed in detail. By examining this evidence and referring to prior work on reflection and reflective practice (Boud et al., 1985; Dewey, 1997; Mezirow, 2004; Schon, 1983), a common plot structure was developed for the sub-narratives: (1) being confronted with a challenging question or situation, (2) bringing prior experience to the thinking process, (3) dealing with feelings related to the challenge, (4) reframing perspective, (5) making a leap of thinking, (6) integrating new knowledge cognitively and affectively, (7) with implications for future practice.

It differs from face-to-face talk-in-interaction in a number of important ways that are significant for participants in the chats and methodologically in terms of the way analysis can be conducted and the kinds of analytical claims that can be made. The perspective adopted in this paper is that chat interaction can be considered the computer-mediated production and reading of texts-in-interaction. However, since the production of a posted text is usually not available to anyone but the author of that text, I am not concerned with the production of posted texts. Rather, I am concerned with the way texts, as produced artifacts, are organized to be read by recipients. In particular, I consider ways in which quasi-synchronous chat postings provide instruction in their design for how they are to be read by recipients of these postings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:26Z (GMT).

Based on recent re- search on what constitutes effective collaboration behavior, we developed a coding scheme to categorize learner-learner interaction as collaboration. In a collaboration environment for learner dyads specifically implemented to test our hypotheses, a human observer identified, in parallel with students' interactions, instances of real collaboration, and gave online feedback. In the same two-factorial design, we varied the resources available to the partners. The influence of these in- terventions on outcomes related to knowledge acquisition, problem-solving, group climate and collaborative behavior was tested. Results suggest there are benefits in providing a feedback ap- proach in fostering collaboration and enhancing problem-solving quality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:27Z (GMT).

This study focuses on supporting scientific argumentation in the classroom through a personally-seeded online discussion system. Students use an online interface to build principles to describe data they have collected. These principles become the seed comments for the online discussions. The software sorts students into discussion groups with students who have built different principles so that each discussion group can consider and critique multiple perspectives. We outline a methodology for (a) coding the individual comments in terms of epistemic operation, grounds, and content normativity and (b) parsing and assessing overall argumentation structure of the oppositional episodes. This study therefore contributes to the research literature both in terms of scaffolding and assessing student argumentation in online asynchronous forums.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:27Z (GMT).

Good team- solutions require team members possessing a good degree of common ground. In this contribution an ICT-tool based upon making individual perspectives explicit to other team members is studied. Two versions of the tool that differed in the extent to which users were coerced to adhere to embedded support principles were used, in both a laboratory and a secondary professional education setting. Coercion, as expected, increased negotiation of common ground in both settings. However, results were contradictory with regard the amount of common ground achieved. Overall, it can be concluded that NTool and its underlying framework affect negotiation of common ground, and that adding some coercion increases this effect. However, one should be careful with the specific task and audience before implementing NTool.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

An experiment providing an information-exchange dilemma task confirmed these expectations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Much of the discussion in distance learning environments occurs in asynchronous forums, and it is content analysis of these discussions that constitutes the majority of research in online learning. However few studies in this area provide enough information about the context to know what works and what doesn't. Most studies do not go beyond downloading and analyzing the transcripts after the course is completed. Studies also lack a solid epistemological stance, attempting to capture evidence of individual learning of knowledge rather than examining the process of group learning through knowledge construction. An ongoing lack of attention to a coherent theoretical foundation, examining transcripts without attending to their situated contexts, and relying primarily on reductionist content analysis methods, will continue to limit our understanding of the potentiality and actuality of online collaborative learning environments. In this paper we explore how Stahl's social theory of CSCL can be applied to formal online learning environments to address these limitations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:26:28Z (GMT).
