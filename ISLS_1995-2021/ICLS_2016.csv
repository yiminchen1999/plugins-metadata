The two types of knowledge develop together, but are fostered by different learning tasks. Exploratory tasks enable students to manipulate representations and discover the underlying concepts. Structured tasks let students practice problem-solving procedures step-by-step. Educational technology has mostly relied on providing only either task type, with a majority of learning environments focusing on structured tasks. We investigated in two quasi-experimental studies with 8-10 years old students from UK (N = 121) and 10-12 years old students from Germany (N = 151) whether a combination of both task types fosters robust knowledge more than structured tasks alone. Results confirmed this hypothesis and indicate that students learning with a combination of tasks gained more conceptual knowledge and equal procedural knowledge compared to students learning with structured tasks only. The results illustrate the efficacy of combining both task types for fostering robust fractions knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, little research has investigated how students learn in the pre-class setting and what factors can help students improve their pre-class learning. Based upon the self-regulated learning theory, this study used both survey research and learning analytics methods to uncover students’ performance trajectories of a semester in two flipped undergraduate math courses and examined whether the three key self-regulated learning factors – self-efficacy, the use of metacognitive strategy, and self-regulatory behaviors – were significantly different across different performance trajectories. The results revealed six different performance trajectories among students and found significant differences across these trajectories in terms of the three self-regulatory factors.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:39Z (GMT).

Taking a practice perspective on IBL can illuminate some challenges that teachers, students and educational designers encounter, and may help researchers operationalize important variables, capturing the complexity of this learning practice. A new definition of IBL will be unpacked showing the added value of regarding it as a practice. This will inform first and foremost the pedagogical design approach, but will also hold implications for methods of research. The feasibility of the ambition to enculturate learners into an authentic practice, providing them with transferrable skills, will be discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:40Z (GMT).

The model is comprised of three research-based qualities that we hypothesize teachers need to demonstrate: flexibility, deeper level understanding, and deliberate practice, in adapting interventions to their particular teaching contexts. We apply the model to understand whether it can, a) show variation between teachers, and b) predict student-learning outcomes. Results show that teacher enactments and interview responses assessed on the model reveal sufficient variation, and are also predictive of students’ growth in complex systems understanding. The model has important implications for how to support teachers in adopting new science education reforms.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, it is difficult to adapt one’s teaching practices without first noticing the key features of classroom activity. This kind of noticing—professional vision—is   a cultivated skill that requires a combination of understanding theory and experience with practice. When theory-practice connections are not strong, teachers tend to fall back on “what works.” Demands to support pre-service teachers in developing stronger theory-practice connections are increasing, yet this remains a challenging goal. The qualitative analysis presented in this paper offers insight into how creation of multimedia artifacts can support pre-service teachers in connecting theory to practice while developing their professional vision. Findings suggest the process of creating and collaboratively refining multimedia artifacts in small groups improves pre-service teachers’ ability to make theory-practice connections and provides opportunity for them to exercise their emerging professional vision.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:44Z (GMT).

I define the joint production of accounts of prior experiences as the unit of social interaction that contains all the essential features of anything that can be ascribed to reflection as a cognitive process. Drawing from empirical (interaction) analyses conducted as part of a larger multi-data project on debriefing and retrospective situations, I describe constitutive features of reflection as collective practice.

This study explores prior knowledge that is relevant to students’ construction of a scientific model of an equilibration pattern. A Knowledge in Pieces lens is applied to video transcript of a class discussion on thermal equilibration in order to identify elements of students’ prior knowledge that might be productive for their construction of a scientific model of equilibration. The discussion occurred near the beginning of a unit on equilibration, in the middle of a yearlong pattern-based curriculum. Twenty-one 8th grade students participated in the class. Six previously undocumented knowledge elements are identified, characterized, and considered in terms of their potential productivity for helping students construct a difference drives rate model of equilibration. These findings contribute to literature concerned with the productivity of prior knowledge in conceptual change.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Because p-prims are a class of knowledge elements developed and abstracted from everyday physical experiences, it seems plausible that immediate physical experiences, both in terms of sensations and actual observations of motion, would cue knowledge in different ways than when those experiences are just discussed as hypotheticals. This paper presents two cases to show that immediate embodied experiences with everyday objects does change which p-prims are cued and how they are deployed by students to explain situations involving motion. These cases come from a corpus of videorecorded interviews with high school students who were asked to explain predicted and enacted motions that involved deliberate sensory engagement with their bodies. Findings suggest that a connection is indeed present, and learners’ embodied experiences should be leveraged in future work to support conceptual change in science.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:47Z (GMT).

Results indicate that although not cognisant of it, these teachers functioned as a reciprocal layer of knowledge builders over their students’ work. Critically, teachers’ knowledge building was enabled by working with authentic classroom problems, embracing idea diversity and demonstrating epistemic agency in their knowledge advancement. Future work can focus on building teacher’s awareness of this layer of knowledge building and scripting creation of knowledge artefacts among teachers to mediate and record their collaborative inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:48Z (GMT).

One context where students seem to persist is gameplay. This paper investigates whether an educational computer programming game can enhance student persistence and learning. Students were assigned to play either the Full version of a game, or a Minimal version of the game that ablated several common game features. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that students who played the Full Game persisted less at challenging tasks, wrote less challenging code during gameplay, and were less willing to learn more about coding in the future. Ultimately, players of the Full Game also learned less than students who played the Minimal Game. Results suggest that certain design features of educational games can negatively impact a player’s approach to challenging learning tasks, which in turn can negatively impact learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:49Z (GMT).

The key phase of having a shared understanding is to have a common ground between the pair. Previous studies showed that explicit deixis plays a major role in initiating and maintaining common ground. This led us to hypothesize that augmenting videos with teacher’s deictic gestures might help students perform better. We found that augmenting the video with teacher’s gaze results in higher learning gain than no visualization. Moreover, gaze visualization also helped students in maintaining longer attention spans than hand gestures.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Based on the findings of these tensions, a pedagogical paradoxes framework is presented, illustrating the interplay between the different dimensions of the paradoxes. By surfacing these paradoxes, we hope to draw awareness to the challenges and reconciliation in the decision-making and rationalisation process that teachers as learning designers may experience.

However, self-regulated online learning is not done in isolation and inherently social. Group awareness research suggests that socio-cognitive information may be a strong asset to collaborative and individual learning. Integrating individual research traditions into a social setting, our experimental study (N = 61) investigates how visualizing socio-cognitive information influences core individual learning processes, especially the search for information, the learners’ self-evaluations of knowledge and learning outcomes. While on the surface study behaviour seemed not to be affected by the availability of socio-cognitive information, more profound analyses revealed that learners provided with partner information did rely less heavily on initial self-evaluations, but adapted their evaluations and focused more on the partner information provided. Knowledge gain was not affected. In conclusion, social context can be an important factor in self-regulation emphasizing that individual and collaborative research traditions may complement each other.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:55Z (GMT).

We report results from a study in which fourth grade children engaged in computational modeling throughout the academic year.

We investigated the question: How do teachers support science practices in their classrooms? We analyzed how two teachers supported students by engaging and guiding students to participate in science practices; we focused on two key science practices: constructing and defending scientific explanations and analyzing and interpreting data. We found that teachers most frequently engaged students in practices but did not necessarily provide guidance for how to participate, explain why science practices are important, or describe how all the practices are connected.

In this paper, I characterize how classroom communities develop sets of epistemic heuristics by engaging in scientific practices over time. Specifically, I present how one classroom community’s implicit answers to “What kind of answer are we working to build?” and to “How does the idea we are trying to build relate to other phenomena and ideas?” shifted throughout a unit. I argue that these shifts were designed into the curriculum, but required strategic work on the teacher’s part; and that these shifts reflect epistemic learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:57Z (GMT).

Through in-depth interviews with teacher participants we find that teachers make use of their learning in four distinct, but related, ways: engagement with new ideas, varied enactment in practice, rethinking of role and identity, and changing interaction with the world outside their classroom.

In our study, 189 elementary school students worked with a conceptual or a procedural fractions ITS, and either individually or collaboratively. Students in both ITS conditions learned, but there were no differences in learning between individual and collaboration.

Using these four methods to analyze the discourse of a pair of students programming, we identified numerous examples of positioning shifts, and see how inequities could potentially emerge through discursive mechanisms. We then reflect on what each of these four different methods foreground, their strengths and shortcomings, including their sensitivity to time-scope and pedagogy, and triangulate the quantified and qualitative results.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:03Z (GMT).

For the 2nd explanation, children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions to use: physical objects; a number line; or no materials (control condition) to explain their thinking. Findings showed how using physical objects significantly influenced the particular types of gestures (e.g. splitting), hand morphology (e.g. pinching), and words (e.g. “take”, “big”) that children used in subsequent explanations without materials. Similar (although less pronounced) priming effects were found for the number line condition. The study provides support for conceptual metaphor theory (used to categorize gestures and language), and the potential for gesture research to address long-standing questions concerning the role of concrete materials in learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:04Z (GMT).

A classroom of 9th grade earth science students created embodied models for a specific scientific concept, the steady state energy of the earth. We describes that the students encountered difficulties aligning their embodied models with their conceptual understandings, and yet, they were able to make progress by changing their models to better align their understanding of the scientific concept with their newly modified model—instances of individual and group learning.

These responses, which can be regarded as instructional “resources” that have potential value for facilitating students’ deep learning, are not fully used in teachers’ everyday practice. By proposing the notion of “student-generated resources” (SGRs) and adopting a “resources use” rather than sociolinguistic perspective, this study investigates what SGRs are there in the classroom and how teachers process them. Based on classroom observations, we identify five types of SGRs. Following the “perceive–interpret–mobilize” processing flow, teachers demonstrate three processing results (utilize, feedback, and abandon). Further, we identify three approaches of teachers’ utilization of SGRs and five approaches of their feedback to SGRs. Our findings suggest that teachers tend to give feedback to SGRs rather than utilize them as resources. This study broadens theoretical landscape about classroom resources and helps teachers take full advantage of SGRs in empowering students’ learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:06Z (GMT).

This paper details our refinements of an innovative method for unpacking the micro-level mechanisms contributing to turning points in the successes and failures in collaborative understanding when learning science with computer modeling. In unpacking our methodology, we discuss work including Sanderson and Fisher’s (1994) exploratory sequential data analysis (ESDA) guidelines and the productive multivocality project (Suthers, 2013) to frame our approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:06Z (GMT).

We investigate whether: (a) analysis of local correlation structure can identify significant differences between novices and relative experts; (b) these differences reflect meaningful differences the discourse; and (c) analysis of global correlation structure can identify significant differences between novices and relative experts. We assess whether an approach that models local relationships among concepts in a domain provides useful information beyond what might be extracted from a more traditional modeling approach.

Situated Action Networks attempt to address this by appropriating techniques from social network analysis while aligning them with Cultural Historical Activity Theory. They accomplish this by (1) elevating learning activities to the forefront of learning visualizations, allowing for rich qualitative analyses of learning and (2) creating theoretically aligned indices that afford quantitative analyses within and across learning environments. Using data on collaborative learning dynamics between informal learning organizations as they engage in joint projects, we show the affordances of this method for understanding learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:09Z (GMT).

Data gathered in task-based semi-structured clinical interviews included action logging, eye-gaze tracking, and videography.

Fundamentally, epistemic learning is proposed because changing classroom practices is more than a surface or shallow change phenomena, but requires teachers to fundamentally shift in perspective or way of seeing how learning is to be practiced. We describe this epistemic learning model and explore its effectiveness. Various types of data were collected, including surveys, interviews, field notes, and teachers’ lesson design artifacts. It is found that the seeded teachers from the five schools, regardless of their own teaching profiles and school contexts, have obtained high degrees of buy-in of the innovation and developed their readiness towards implementation for the future enactments. It is envisioned that such an epistemic learning model will inform the design for teacher professional development, in the pursuit of innovation diffusion, serving a wider community of the teaching practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:12Z (GMT).

We examined youth in our interview study who reported experiencing disruptions to their interest-related pursuits. We found that some youth suspended their participation due to loss of access to necessary resources, and other youth suspended pursuits due to competing educational commitments and future desires.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:13Z (GMT).

In this study, twenty-six undergraduate students were interviewed to reason about competing arguments on global climate change. In-depth analysis of participants’ interview responses demonstrated important characteristics of the cognitive processes and underpinning mechanisms of scientific reasoning. This work adds to ongoing discussion about the nature of scientific reasoning and provides a holistic approach to characterizing and evaluating scientific reasoning. Furthermore, by capturing important features of individuals’ reasoning when faced with climate issues, this work has significant implications for classroom science teaching and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:14Z (GMT).

Using students’ self reports, we found that students encountered failure mostly in the design and crafting of circuits, and in these exploration phases students generated a multitude of successful and unsuccessful solutions. Our findings indicate that students’ design artifacts function as a source of within-task feedback supporting their persistence through failures.

It complements agent-based models of systems by representing a micro-level individual’s properties, events and location, together with macro-level variables of the system. The study examines whether this perceptual compensation creates a comparable learning environment. Students who are blind worked with auditory models; sighted students used visual models. Conceptual understanding and systems reasoning were assessed with pre- and post-test questionnaires. Learning processes were captured by analyzing their workbook writings. The L2C environment not only supported blind students’ learning similarly, but also furthered their learning with one of the more challenging concepts, diffusion. Some concepts relating to the micro-level were learned earlier among the blind students. It seems that auditory representation increases sensitivity to the micro-level interactions in a way less accessible in visual representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:17Z (GMT).

The goal of this paper is to illustrate how well-coordinated groups establish and sustain joint visual attention by unpacking their different strategies and behaviors. Our data was collected in a dual eye-tracking setup where dyads of students (N=54) had to interact with a Tangible User Interface (TUI). We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989). We conclude by discussing implications for automatically analyzing students’ interactions using dual eye-trackers.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, other mechanisms of PF have not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we focus on the role of communication patterns during the initial problem-solving phase. Using existing process data from a PF study, we investigated communication patterns based on the ICAP-model and correlated them with prior knowledge, quantity and quality of student solutions, and conceptual knowledge at post-test. Our findings suggest that interactive communication during the initial problem-solving phase only fosters conceptual knowledge if students discuss those ideas that particularly lend themselves to being contrasted with critical aspects of the correct solution during the subsequent instruction phase.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:19Z (GMT).

The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by a classroom study with two conditions.

To investigate negotiation towards intersubjectivity along with students’ conceptual outcomes, we studied the discourse of two groups of middle-school students who participated in a 12-week science curriculum. We also evaluated differences in scores on a physics assessment. We found differences in how groups negotiated shared understandings of tasks and concepts and how they participated in conceptual discourse. Group A required significantly more instances of negotiation to establish intersubjectivity compared to Group B, indicating that Group A struggled with establishing shared understandings. Students in Group A also demonstrated greater variance in conceptual discourse and assessment scores, whereas Group B demonstrated more aligned conceptual outcomes. These results indicate that effective negotiation for establishing intersubjectivity is not only an important first step for students’ participation in conceptual discourse, but also for achieving balanced learning gains across group members.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:22Z (GMT).

In this paper, we report on the results of a design-based research study, in which 4th grade students used a web-based tool called Local Ground to collect data, model, and collaboratively analyze what’s underground in the local soil ecology around their school. We examine the affordances of situating children’s data modeling in local spaces and using Local Ground as a representational medium. We find that this instructional design supported children in integrating their experiential knowledge to reason about organisms in relation to the environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:23Z (GMT).

He has also criticized them for a retrograde conception of science. This paper starts by agreeing with his second point and elaborates it into a fuller critique of naïve scientific epistemology, arriving at the conclusion that a better epistemology points to a better pedagogy. The key is a programmatic view of science, which sees the scientific enterprise as working continually toward stronger explanations of natural phenomena. This is a program that can be joined by people at all levels of sophistication, including young children, the goal always being to make today’s ideas superior in some demonstrable way to yesterday’s. Engaging students in explanation improvement has numerous advantages over atheoretical inquiry and project-based activities. Knowledge Building is highlighted as an approach that gives idea improvement a central place in its pedagogy.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We scrutinize the moment-by-moment interactions among practitioners for episodes in which different modalities of embodied action are recruited and coordinated to produce and communicate complex meanings in the practice.

In particular, we observed that students’ often misinterpreted the virtual models or used them inappropriately to confirm prior ideas. Similarly, even when guided to construct appropriate graphs, students were unable to conceptually link the abstract representation to concrete conceptual knowledge. On the other hand, by centering student thinking on the data in the 2nd iteration and using the models to illustrate abstract concepts conveyed in graphs, students were more likely to perform appropriate investigations and develop coherent, integrated explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:25Z (GMT).

Yet, the effectiveness of the script depended on individual prerequisites such as final high school grade (GPA) and self-regulation skills. In this study, N = 96 participants learned in one of three script conditions. We found that a high-structured domain-general collaboration script for argumentation was more effective for acquiring domain-specific mathematical argumentation skills than a low-structured or an adaptable one. Furthermore, only in the condition with the low-structured script, learners’ self-regulated learning skills played an important role for the learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:26Z (GMT).

In this paper we present a careful analysis of an intervention designed to overcome coordination difficulties by welcoming students into the chat on a rolling basis as they arrive rather than requiring them to be matched with a partner before beginning. The results suggest the most positive impact when experiencing a chat with exactly one partner rather than more or less. A qualitative analysis of the chat data reveals differential experiences between these configurations that suggests a potential explanation for the effect and raises questions for future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:27Z (GMT).

Social support from parents can be essential to engaging children, but for parents with limited backgrounds in computing, they are often unsure what roles they can play. For parents to develop supportive roles, they must gain first-hand experience in creative computing for themselves and with their children. In this paper, we examine the experiences of parents participating in a community-based program called Family Creative Learning, where families design and invent together using creative technologies like Scratch. We describe three case studies of how parents developed multiple roles such as collaborator, teacher, and learner as they created and collaborated with their children on technology-based projects. We discuss design opportunities to provide meaningful experiences for parents and children to build projects and build supportive roles around computing.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:35Z (GMT).

In this comparative case study, we take a situative view of learning to examine the learning opportunities afforded in workgroup meetings with middle-school math teachers and pedagogically expert facilitators. Using interaction analysis, we analyze the role of representations in affording learning opportunities. The facilitators framed workgroup activity differently than the teachers; learning opportunities were limited when teachers were not able to engage the facilitators’ framings. But by introducing rich representations of practice, the facilitators attuned teachers’ attention to key conceptual resources. This scaffolded the workgroup into new forms of practice, thereby supporting teachers’ opportunities to learn more ambitious forms of professional practice. This work highlights the need for facilitators and instructional leaders to attend to issues of teacher learning in collaborative activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:35Z (GMT).

I use this model to analyze and describe the individual student learning of three high school students engaged in a generalization task and the emergent social power dynamics. Findings show that whereas students made statements that positioned themselves as having the correct answer (i.e., as mathematical authorities), some students resorted to a broader arsenal of semiotic resources to make their point, which resulted in differentiated status positions. Thus some students gained “mathematical ascendency” over others, which refers to the co-construction of hierarchical positional identities emerging from the obj–subj dialectic during multimodal interactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:37Z (GMT).

The present study investigated these questions in the context of teacher education. 76 teacher students solved a problem case from their future practice either individually or in dyads that were homo- or heterogeneous with respect to their members’ problem solving scripts. The results show that although dyads have an advantage on generating hypotheses to explain the problem; individuals engage more in generating solutions. Moreover, especially heterogeneous dyads seem to differ from individuals’ approaches. Future studies could investigate further how to use groups’ potential in generating hypotheses to facilitate them in generating solutions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:38Z (GMT).

To address these issues, we investigate the approach of embedding computational thinking content into required high school mathematics and science coursework. Using data from a 3-year implementation, we present results showing differences in attitudes towards computing by gender, while also finding similar gaps do not correlate with aptitude. Using pre/post measures, we then show female participants expressed improved confidence with computational thinking and interest in STEM careers. Additionally, we report a dosage effect, where participating in more activities resulted in greater learning gains, providing evidence in support of embedding computational thinking enhanced activities across high school curriculum.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:40Z (GMT).

The new standards are a radical departure from previous standards in their focus on science practices. Not only have general notions of inquiry been replaced by specific science practices students should learn, but the standards articulate a vision of instruction that places student engagement in science practices as the means though which science concepts should be learned. Teacher educators recognize this shift places profound demands on teachers and teacher learning. We report evidence from the start of an NGSS professional development project on how teachers’ understanding of the science practices emerges from their efforts to re-design instruction to align with them. Our analysis suggests teachers’ initial understanding is quite far from the vision of NGSS. We characterize this understanding and consider its implications for teacher professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We coded two groups’ discourse to examine the use of knowledge resource types in the meaning-making process in an outdoor learning setting: contextual resource, new conceptual resource, prior knowledge resource, as well as the relationship among these knowledge resource types. Next, we also examined environmental interaction and integration in the students’ use of these knowledge resource types. Analysis showed that contextual resources are chiefly instrumental in fostering students’ capacity to harness new conceptual resource and to activate prior knowledge resource in interacting with and integrating the outdoor learning environment in the meaning-making process.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:44Z (GMT).

We found that a combination of students’ constructive and active interaction (e.g., manipulating and constructing representations) with multiple fractions representations as compared to students’ active interaction (e.g., looking at representations) with multiple representations leads to higher conceptual knowledge measured by students’ ability to flexibly represent a fraction. Furthermore, students’ representational flexibility was correlated with their general learning performance when students’ interacted constructively and actively with representations but not when they interacted only actively with representations. In line with the ICAP-framework we conclude that active interactions trigger more intensively attending processes whereas constructive interactions trigger more intensively creating processes and are thus superior to the first kind of students’ cognitive engagement with multiple representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:45Z (GMT).

This study was guided by the theoretical framework that sustainable change requires sustained and aligned learning at multiple levels of the education system, and that greater scale in the innovation affords peer learning at multiple levels. It investigates the sustainability of three e-learning pilot projects in Hong Kong by studying the changes, if any, in (1) the e-learning pedagogical practices (the innovation) that was developed, and (2) the “architecture for learning” that was put into place at multiple levels in order to steer and implement the project, within the first school year after the formal 3-year funding ended. The findings indicate that the nature of the innovation as envisioned and the architecture for learning that was put into place in each project were critical in determining the subsequent sustainability of the projects.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:46Z (GMT).

However, research supporting this stance has employed questions that could be considered to be teleologically-leading, suggesting a partially inaccurate view of children's tendency to provide teleological explanations. This paper compares a teleologically-leading treatment (what is X for?) with an open-treatment (why is there X?), finding that the leading-treatment resulted in significantly more teleological explanations that the open-treatment. This suggests children's proposed bias to provide teleological rationales about the natural world may be being overestimated.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:28Z (GMT).

We analyze 15 case studies of video-based discussions in school-based teacher teams, identifying and classifying face-threatening acts and the facework involved in responding to them. We then identify and analyze exemplary cases involving key facework strategies (face threat avoidance, face defending, and face correction), focusing on the ways these strategies opened up or closed down opportunities for learning. This study will contribute to our understanding of the interaction of social and cognitive dimensions of professional learning in general, and of teacher facework in video-based professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:30Z (GMT).

We first employed purposeful semi-structured interviews to understand the value academic leaders place in cross-specialization interactions and then collected questionnaires from which we conducted statistical and social network analyses to describe the characteristics of and variation within disciplinary interaction networks and the relationships between network attributes and perceptions of a positive, collaborative learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:31Z (GMT).

In particular, the students demonstrated better performance when receiving the fit feedback than the non-fit feedback. Further analysis of different performing groups showed that this identified interaction was significant only for the middle performing students, but not for the lower or higher performing groups.

In this study, we use Epistemologies in Practice as our theoretical framework to examine students’ engagement in modeling practice. We used a comparison approach to analyze 26 classroom video recordings in order to understand how two teachers framed modeling practices in the same modeling-based unit. In doing so, we analyzed what support teachers provided students as they engaged in modeling and how that might have led to students’ engagement in several epistemic aspects of modeling practices. Our findings suggest that how teachers framed the purpose and goals of modeling appeared to have a great influence on how students engaged in the modeling practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:33Z (GMT).

Transferring research on the facilitation of complex cognitive skills from instructional design, two approaches may be effective: Fostering the constituents one by one respectively fostering them simultaneously. We therefore present an intervention study that takes a holistic approach on MA&P skills and their constituents, comparing a sequential (one-by-one) and an integrated (simultaneous) instructional approach to foster each constituent skill as well as students’ overall MA&P skills. The results show that learners in the integrated condition and the sequential condition have very similar learning gains that differ only in their mathematical strategic knowledge, which is superior in the integrated condition.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:34Z (GMT).

Learners experience difficulties with the involved processes and need guidance to design useful experiments. To guide students in this we created a configurable experiment design tool that is usable in multiple domains. The tool was tested with two configurations; one with a CVS structure in which learners had to design at least three experimental trials before conducting their experiment, and one in which this was not required. In the current study secondary students designed and conducted experiments in an online lab about buoyancy and Archimedes’ principle. Three conditions were compared in terms of students’ conceptual knowledge gain. Students worked with one configuration of the tool, or with no tool. Results showed significant differences between conditions for lower prior knowledge students’ learning gain about buoyancy.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:35Z (GMT).

Disinheritance is the relationship a learner has to a designed tool or environment that makes the learner perceive it as not designed for them, not belonging to them. Disinheritance offers new ways of combining design-based interventions with ethnography about design in a “marginalized” part of the world, and is necessarily also concerned with economics, politics and how they shape design on a global scale. Building on Vygotsky’s cultural heritage and Marx’s alienation, the theory of disinheritance sets a new programmatic agenda for learning sciences research.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:36Z (GMT).

Due to constraints of resources and designs, building “productive moments of uncertainty” (Manz, 2015) into the classroom to facilitate argumentation is challenging. This study addresses such challenge by analyzing how 6th graders resolve disagreements when evaluating epistemic and disciplinary claims. Preliminary findings suggest that talking about epistemic concerns without disciplinary engagement is not productive. Embedding epistemic practice in resolving disciplinary disagreements, however uncomplicated it may seem, would foster productive argumentation. Understanding what disagreements are challengingly resolvable and how both epistemic and disciplinary practices play a role in evaluating claims thus sheds needed light on designing effective learning environments that foster deep learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:37Z (GMT).

The broader aim is to provide student teachers with hands-on experiences of using novel, technology-enhanced formative assessment systems for 21st century skills.

We then use this comparison to discuss the tension between maintaining accountability to the discipline and fostering students’ agency and authority; a tension that is not sufficiently addressed in science education literature that addresses the conceptualization of authenticity and relevance. We suggest a research agenda that aims to resolve this tension by problematizing and articulating in fine detail the theoretical meaning of productive disciplinary engagement and expansive framing for science classrooms that are deeply immersed in authentic scientific practices and discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:38Z (GMT).

Teams were categorized into four levels of team effectiveness based on the measures. A content analysis of teamwork competency dimensions was also performed. Our findings revealed the need for balance in teamwork competency behaviors for effective learning teams. Insights from the findings could lead to design principles for interventions to nurture teamwork competency in our 21st century learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:42Z (GMT).

We propose that the coordination between the participants is facilitated in the presence of their differences through the computational artifacts they create, which serve as boundary objects. Furthermore, integrating art into these interventions promotes abstract thinking, enabling the boundary objects to flow more seamlessly between weakly and strongly structured implementations and interpretations. We examine this proposition within a case study of a dance and technology workshop.

We argue that (a) a deterministic perspective is as useful as a probabilistic one, (b) even experts implicitly exhibit (do not lose) deterministic assumptions, (c) probabilistic mental models are built on top of deterministic models, using multiple instances of the phenomena of interest, and (d) expertise involves willfully switching between pre- and post-threshold assumptions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:44Z (GMT).

We conducted both qualitative and quantitative analyses on Wiki contributions. The addition of visual highlights indicating controversies reinforced students to direct their attention towards important contents discussing the study’s subject matter.

Previous research has identified surface characteristics of the OKC dialog as integrativity predictors. Yet, little is known about the role of dialogic textual complexity. This contribution proposes a comprehensive approach based on previously validated textual complexity indexes and applies it to predict OKC integrativity. The dialog analysis of N = 14 blogger communities with a total of 1937 participants identified three main components of textual complexity: dialog participation, structure and cohesion. From these, dialog cohesion was higher in integrative OKCs, thus significantly predicting OKC integrativity. This result adds to previous OKC research by uncovering the depth of OKC discourse. For educational practice, the study suggests a way of empowering learners by automatically assessing the integrativity of OKCs in which they may attempt to participate and access community knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:47Z (GMT).

We then turn to data collected through extended participant observation to characterize decisions students make. Based on these, we detail a developmental agency trajectory: dis/engagement agency serves as a covert means for students to learn; makerly agency serves as an entry point for students to explore and develop interests, and designerly agency allows students to take ownership of design problems and learn as they do so.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:53Z (GMT).

This paper outlines one system devised by a team of design-based researchers for documenting their research process and organizing their data. Inspired by the hierarchical workflow model suggested by Hackbarth et al.

The suggested approach is available to most researchers, including those who might not have access to sophisticated database resources and knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:57Z (GMT).

The result was that the cognitive development is improved in the structured CPS learning tasks under the mediation of semantic diagram tools. While, the basic understanding, rather than the high level understanding of learning topic is improved. What’s more, the CPS interaction, rather than the CPS engagement make the positive contribution to the cognitive development. This finding gives some insight of design of the CPS learning task and semantic diagram tools in the future study.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Pedagogical sequence (i.e., generation-first or instruction-first) and type of analogical reasoning task (i.e., generating one’s own analogical problems or generating analogical mappings between given analogical problems) were the two factors manipulated. Preliminary analysis revealed no multivariate effects of the factors.

For this study the authors developed interview protocols on several topics that involve numbers increasing linearly and exponentially. Students’ verbal and gestural responses during the interviews were transcribed, coded, categorized and analyzed. Results showed that students display a breadth of context-dependent gestures, that their verbal reasoning is associated with the type of gesture they produce, and that gesture-speech mismatches are present in middle school students’ reasoning about scale. Implications of this study include design guidelines for an interactive system that standardizes and structures scale-related gestures.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:04Z (GMT).

Immediately upon task completion, students reported their epistemic emotions as well as motivation during the task. Path analyses revealed that epistemic emotions during problem solving predicted the motivation students invested in solving the complex reasoning task. Finally, intrinsic motivation positively predicted task performance. The findings suggest complex linkages of epistemic emotions with motivational mechanisms during reasoning and knowledge generating processes and demonstrate the adaptive and maladaptive functions of epistemic emotions. Consequently their role for complex reasoning should be considered in future research and can guide instructional design to foster reasoning in mathematics.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:06Z (GMT).

We discuss how our approaches to video analysis are framed by theory and how we have applied them to specific datasets, to answer a variety of research questions. In doing so, we make explicit some crosscutting methodological norms and invite continued discussion about these norms from multiple analytic traditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:07Z (GMT).

The set of strategies developed provides a common Knowledge Constructive Jigsaw framework or set of “constraints” to guide the practices of participants for reflection on learning and to expand children’s potential to learn, teachers’ potential to support student learning, and policy makers’ potential to support teacher learning. Building Cultural Capacity for Innovation represents a vision shared by teams in Japan and internationally to transform schools into knowledge creating organizations, to learn from one another, and to—in Naomi’s words--support a science of practice deeply embedded in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:14Z (GMT).

SGIs place students’ ideas at the center of learning designs, considering the learning process as well as the learning goals/outcomes. By soliciting and foregrounding students’ diversified ideas in the classroom and beyond, the learning environment communicates to students that their ideas matter to others and that they have a position of responsibility to their own and their peers’ learning processes. The notion of SGIs is embodied in a repertoire of studies at the Learning Sciences Lab, National Institute of Education, Singapore, that offer varied yet overlapping interpretations of how student ideas can inform the design of learning contexts. In sharing the core design principles for SGIs approaches, this work contributes important components to the learning sciences discipline and changing educational practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:16Z (GMT).

People can and do get interested in STEM-based activities in the various spaces in which they encounter these activities—e.g., the home, museums, hobby fields, school, and after-school programs. However, because each such setting operates under different constraints and affordances, the forms of interest-based participation they spawn and support are qualitatively different. This symposium brings together four distinct research projects, each of which addresses very different settings, aspects, and phenomena in people’s interest-based participation in STEM. The projects also deploy very different methodologies to document and measure people’s interests. By comparing and contrasting these very distinct takes on interests and their manifestations across settings, we gain insight into both generalities and context specific aspects of interests and their enactment.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:17Z (GMT).

Its theoretical roots lie in the sociocultural tradition, in particular Vygotsky’s view that the inter-mental with practice becomes interiorized and transformed into the intra-mental.  We report on the gains observed among successive cohorts, relative to close comparison groups who engaged in non-dialogic whole-class discussion. Gains are seen both in dialogic argumentation and in individual written argument, specifically with respect to counterargument and the use of evidence.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:23Z (GMT).
