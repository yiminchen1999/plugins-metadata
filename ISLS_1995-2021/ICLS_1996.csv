The model underlying the simulation is visible, manipulable, and represented in a form that easily connects with the students' theoretical understanding. Students construct their own models to explain the behavior of the system. With DEVICE, we hope to find a middle ground between merely viewing a simulation and building one from scratch where the students are able to actually complete and learn through modeling tasks. The first version of DEVICE allowed students to view, but not manipulate, the model. User tests showed that the models need to be malleable at the modeling level, not just the simulation level.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:29:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our ITS, CIRCSIM-Tutor (CST), is designed to assist first year medical students to learn to reason about blood pressure regulation. Our study of human tutoring sessions is the basis for the design of CST. Our protocol (both human and computer tutoring sessions) begins with an explanation of a problem (a disturbance to the circulatory system). The student then makes predictions about the ensuing qualitative causal effects. This is followed by an interactive dialogue. This protocol allows for the student to ask questions, although this rarely happens. Other ITSs and automated training systems require that the student work on a problem and explicitly ask for help. The ITS literature has examples of how other systems differ in tutoring protocol, knowledge domain and student population. How do these differences affect the use of hints?","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We analyzed the design interactions in a microgenetic fashion to identify the progression of students' mathematical thinking. In addition, we paid close attention to the contribution of students' social interactions to the increasing sophistication of fraction representations in the game context.

On the one hand, commercial authoring tools can be used by educators to ease construction of learning environments. However, these tools provide no guidance in terms of pedagogy. On the other hand, construction tools for intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) can assist educators in authoring tutoring systems by helping them encode instructional content, but many require authors to specify explicit models such as teaching strategies and student models. Although the resulting software is pedagogically principled, encoding these models is cumbersome. For educators to create quality tutoring programs with relative ease, our approach combines the commitment to pedagogy of the ITS tools, with the ease of authoring of off-the-shelf tools, by embedding a pedagogical model implicitly in a tool. The embedded model ensures that the resulting learning environments will be pedagogically sound, while freeing educators to concentrate on curriculum content. We demonstrate this with a case study of a prototype authoring tool, Investigative Goal-Based Scenario (IGBS) Builder, intended for educators building multimedia learning environments using an embedded pedagogical model of situated instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:03Z (GMT).

Research in case-based reasoning (CBR), which provides a plausible model of learning from problem solving situations, makes suggestions about education that are consistent with these educational theories and methodologies and which can provide added concreteness and detail. In this paper, we show how CBR's suggestions can enhance problem-based learning (PBL), which is already a well-worked-out and successful approach to education. The computational accounts CBR provides of reasoning activities, especially of knowledge access, access to old experiences (cases), and use of old experiences in reasoning, suggest guidelines about materials that should be made available as resources, the kinds of reflection that will promote transfer, qualities of good problems, qualities of the environment in which problems are solved (e.g., affordances for feedback), and sequencing a curriculum. The two approaches complement each other well, and together, we believe they provide a powerful foundation for educational practice in the constructivist tradition, one that at once combines lessons learned from classroom practice with sound cognitive theory.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:04Z (GMT).

This paper examines some of the common design issues faced when building learning-by-doing environments and analyzes the relationship between those design issues and the key features of learning architectures, especially an architecture we are currently developing called Advise. We also discuss the circumstances under which Advise is appropriate and when other architectures would be a better choice. 1. Introduction We believe that for learning-environment design and development to make more rapid progress, it is important for educational researchers to stop focusing primarily on such abstract questions as whether to pursue an approach like learning-by-doing, and more on how to pursue the particular approach they advocate. For instance, even if one accepts the basic philosophy - as we do - that some sort of coached learning-by-doing environment is the most effective way to teach, numerous design alternatives for teaching any particular subject area remain open. The real question for advocates of learning-by-doing is ""Learning what by doing what?"". Our own experience building computer-based learning-by-doing environments (e.g. Bareiss &amp; Beckwith, 1993; Bell &amp; Bareiss, 1993; Kass, Dooley, &amp; Luksa, 1993; Schank, 1992) as well as the experiences of others doing similar work (e.g. Anderson, 1993; Bransford, 1990; Lesgold, Lajoie, Bunzo, &amp; Eggan, 1988; Soloway, Guzdial, &amp; Hay, 1994) have taught us that many decisions related to the structure of learning-by-doing environments that have a major impact on the effectiveness ofthe final product. Mapping a set of pedagogical goals and practical considerations into an appropriate design is a complex process. That process, which is relatively unexplored in the literature, is the central topic of this paper. 1.1 Advise: A Sample architecture In this paper we'll use a particular learning-by-doing architecture, called Advise, with which we're currently experimenting to illustrate some issues that relate to choosing and implementing appropriate learning-by-doing environments. Advise is a computer-based learning architecture which places students in the role of advisor to an important decision-maker, such as the President of the United States. Students are given the mission of evaluating the effectiveness of several courses of action, providing evidence for their evaluations, and recommending one of the options. To help complete the task, students are given a large hypermedia reference library of information and expert opinions about the issue, a skeletal report, and a panel of opinionated experts who represent conflicting perspectives about the issue. Upon submitting the report for review, students receive a critique which focuses on the quality of the evidence he used to support his conclusions. Students can then revise and resubmit the report. We're currently using the Advise architecture to create applications designed to teach topics in foreign policy, earth science, and statistics. For example, the foreign-policy application is based around a crisis situation in a fictional country we call Krasnovia, which is modeled after events in the former Yugoslavia. The structure of the learning environment is as .follows: The student gets an emergency phone call from the White House, asking him to come down on the double to help with an emerging crisis. On the way to the White House the student watches a new report explaining that the fighting in the Krasnovian capital has intensified and there is new pressure on the US to respond. At the White House, the President tells the student that he needs help because his knowledgeable advisors are providing mutually contradictory advice. He asks the student to evaluate the possible options mi recommend one.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These efforts and achievements are diverse in nature and their assessment cannot be separated from the context of performance, which includes interests, resources, skill at collaboration, and prior knowledge and skill. Five metafunctions are described as a potential beginning point for building an assessment model of student-centered projects. The metafunctions are resourcefulness, reflection, authentic, extension, and connectedness.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study examined the effects of building semantic networks on the coherence and utility of expert systems subsequently constructed by undergraduates. The ambiguity of the task was problematic for many of the students, so more scaffolding of required actions would be appropriate. The kinds of thinking required to build semantic nets and expert systems were quite different, with no facilitative effect of one on the other.

In this paper, we report on one detailed implementation where 7 conceptual areas were evaluated. The results showed improvements in students' visualizations of atoms and molecules, but it was not clear if the students' initial models were replaced.

The most powerful reason is the extremely large variance found in any index of learning achievement, even in relatively homogeneous populations.

Computational science is becoming increasingly important, not just for scientists, but also for students who need to gain expertise with similar investigations for their scientific careers. However, because students lack the expertise of professional researchers, complexities arise that pose obstacles to students trying to use computational science to conduct scientific investigations: complexity in the number of diverse investigative tasks to perform, in the lack of tools for supporting certain activities, and in the variety of existing tools and interfaces that students have to learn.

By using different scaffolding strategies, we found that we were able to build a tool that helps support nuclear engineering students investigating problems from their domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:08Z (GMT).

The paper describes three main categories of distributed constructionist activities: discussing constructions, sharing constructions, and collaborating on constructions. In each category, it describes ongoing research projects at the MIT Media Lab and discusses how these projects support new ways of thinking and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:08Z (GMT).

Part of the problem has been the difficulty of authoring them, even using authoring tools specialized to the task. We argue that the authoring task can be redefined for environments based on the ""plug-in"" instructional architecture described by Ritter and Koedinger (1995). In systems using that architecture, specialized authoring tools can be developed for each component of the architecture, greatly simplifying both the authoring process and the task of creating authoring tools. We describe an authoring tool directed at creating the ""translator"" portion of such an architecture. This authoring tool uses programming by demonstration to allow a non-programmer to re-use existing tutoring agents with new interface tools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:09Z (GMT).

This study describes how different artifacts, social configurations, and physical arrangements lead to different interactional spaces and participant roles, and, concomitantly, to different levels of participation in classroom conversations. The artifacts had important functions in the maintenance and sequence of the conversations. Depending on the situation and the role of participants, artifacts served as resources for students' sense making. Each of the different activity structures supported different dimensions of participating in conversations and, for this reason, we conclude that science educators teaching large classes should employ a mixture of these activity structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:10Z (GMT).

Such sentiments are echoed in almost all major reports on engineering education. Two approaches for addressing this issue are to provide students with more engineering design experiences and to find ways to enhance the learning the results from existing experiences. This paper focuses on the second approach since providing students with more design experiences can be costly and, at the same time, evidence suggests that students do not always capitalize effectively on the potential learning opportunities stemming from such experiences. This paper proposes a framework for reflective activities that students can perform in order to enhance their learning from engineering design experiences. More specifically, this paper presents 1) some data suggesting that learning opportunities may arise through project based engineering design experiences but may not go unpursued, 2) a framework for reflective activities designed to facilitate students in pursuing these learning opportunities, 3) two slightly different instantiations of that activity, and 4) the proposed evaluation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:10Z (GMT).

In this paper we describe software, some of which is currently being tested in classrooms, which allows students to create and share word problems moti vated by classroom discussion of an arithmetically relevant situation, and to dynamically explore links between linguistic and other symbolic representations of their problems and those of other children. In conjunction with the discursive approach, these facilities support pedagogical methods such as the integration of writing, science and mathematics; roles for stu dents as knowledge contributors rather than as passive recipients; and a motivated use of the computer for understanding mathematical problem relationships.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:10Z (GMT).

Leaming is problem-based. Students are asked to design and layout a playground in order to learn to measure, draw to scale, and compute perimeter, area, and volume. The curriculum encourages an iterative approach to problem solving in which students create designs, give each other feedback, and revise their work. To support their problem solving, a software environment provides a simple model of the design task that aids students in identifying sub-goals, brainstorming questions that provide general procedural hints, and two structured multimedia databases: A student database is used to record students' designs, annotated with procedures used, new concepts learned, design rationale, and evaluations.Aperformance support database provides an archive of previously created designs with associated conceptual and procedural information.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:11Z (GMT).

All students performed a searching activity, then browsed freely through the system. Students then commented on their perceptions of the system and drew concept maps of the contents. Regression analyses indicate that per formance with the map-like navigation tool is positively correlated with environmental cognition, whereas performance with the menu-like navigation tool is positively correlated with spatial visualization and reasoning. The general findings suggest that spatial navigation tools should be incorporated into instructional hypermedia with less spatial navigation methods to complement students' spatial cognitive abilities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:12Z (GMT).

Mental models are the internal, conceptual and operational representations that humans develop while interacting with complex systems. In this paper, we argue that they are also embedded in the activities engaged in by a community of practice, the social relations among members of that community, the discourse used by that community to negotiate meaning, and in the artifacts that are used and produced by the community during their activity. This paper describes two studies: one aimed at eliciting mental models in the heads of novice refrigeration technicians and the other an ethnographic study eliciting knowledge and models in the community of experienced refrigeration technicians.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:17Z (GMT).

Computer delivered, case-based learning environments can be developed to provide students with valuable diagnostic experiences prior to dealing with real patients. Diagnostic skill requires physicians to understand and use causal reasoning in order to make predictions. That causal reasoning may be scaffolded in the design of those environments. This paper describes the scaffolding of causal reasoning in making initial diagnoses, determining etiology, and making differential diagnoses in platelet related problems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:17Z (GMT).

But typically, the notion of a ""manipulative"" carries with it a number of additional assumptions: that these objects are designed for elementary (as opposed to advanced) mathematics instruction; that they have little in the way of emotional meaning for their users; and that they are relatively simple, ""low-tech"" objects. In this paper we challenge these assumptions. Drawing on our experiences in two related projects in educational computing, we suggest that manipulatives may be designed for advanced mathematical topics; that they may offer creative (and thus affectively important) opportunities for students; and that they may be designed in ways that accompany or incorporate computational media.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:17Z (GMT).

The domain is that of integer arithmetic and the target skills and concepts of the learning system relate to long division with remainder. We studied students' learning performance using a computer-based learning environment representing division as repeated subtraction from the dividend and facilitating the exploration and construction of multiples of the divisor to be subtracted. The learning environment also took over the subtasks of multiplication, addition and subtraction from the student. In particular, we studied the extent to which students were constrained in their freedom to construct solution paths and the effect of this factor on learning performance. Results showed that students profited from this learning environment, but the more optimal solutions reached under constrained problem solving could not be demon strated in a pre-post test comparison using only paper-and-pencil type problems. It appears that this performance can only be reached if the learning environment assists the student with lower-level subtasks and that more advanced strategic knowledge is required in order to reach the same level of performance without this support.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:23Z (GMT).

MEDICUS is developed in collaboration with several medical institutions in the epidemiological fields of environmentally caused diseases and human genetics. Uncertainty is handled by the Bayesian network approach. In modeling, the user creates a Bayesian network for the problem at hand, receiving help information and explanations from the system. This differs from existing reasoning systems based on Bayesian networks, i.e. in medical domains, which contain a built-in knowledge base that may be used but not created or modified by the user. MEDICUS supports diagnostic reasoning by proposing diagnostic hypotheses and recommending examinations. In this paper we will focus on the modeling component of MEDICUS.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is based on a kind of teaching framework called a goal based scenario, a ""learning by doing"" environment in which the student acts in a realistic role and obtains helpful coaching while performing assigned tasks. I describe a fully operational prototype system, Financial Report Analyst (FRA), which was built using this architecture. In FRA, the student learns skills in financial statement analysis by playing the role of a lending officer at a bank. The approach offers several advantages over the traditional business case method. Usability tests of FRA were conducted with students in the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. It is proposed that the software architecture is applicable to teaching a variety of realistic analysis tasks, both inside and out of the domain of business administration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:24Z (GMT).

CIRcsIM-Tutor v. 3 is a natural-language based ITS for cardiac physiology currently under development. Text planning for v. 3 will be accomplished by TIPS, a text planning engine based on current research in text generation. We describe how TIPS will achieve the goals mentioned above. We use transcripts of sessions conducted by expert human tutors to derive tutoring patterns for TIPS. Through the use of the TIPS planner, we expect CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 3 to generate longer, more complex and more natural text than previous work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:25Z (GMT).

The particular elements within the framework generalize to other design tasks to various extents. The teaching/learning activities were successful in enabling children in these two classes to achieve above grade level and to look more like East Asian than U.S. children in their multidigit concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:25Z (GMT).

This report of an ethnographic case study in one 8th-grade science class discusses the specific difficulties encountered in implementing PBL and identifies coping strategies improvised by teacher and students in adapting to the unfamiliar roles and expectations ofthe PBL approach. Classroom observation and interviews with the teacher reveal the importance not only of training teachers in the appropriate classroom techniques but also ofproviding ongoing support as they develop context-sensitive PBL modules and acquire deeper understanding and acceptance ofthe philosophy underlying the new approach. Reflection infuses the teaching and learning processes, encouraging all participants to re-view both content knowledge and knowledge about learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:26Z (GMT).

To invite learners into thinking about science issues, we introduced the topic of a local endangered rain forest called Clayoquot Sound. For two years, students built a range of paper and multimedia artifacts. This community of investigators made extensive use of analog and digital video, multimedia analysis tools, and the Internet. The results of this ethnography indicate that digital media can become learning environments that support personal, narrative, and relational ways of knowing the world, especially when the content addresses real-world issues. One conclusion I have made is that gender identity is a more flexible construct than has been suggested in previous empirical studies. Both girls and boys need opportunities for ""genderflexing"" - for extending beyond traditional epistemological boundaries. While genderflexing, young people learn to cross over boundaries that have previously both defined and confined science education","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-16T04:30:26Z (GMT).
