We suggest an alternative metaphor, where students are viewed as longstanding members of an overlapping yet different culture than that represented by the instructional setting. This metaphor allows for sensitivity to learning difficulties that arise when students' contextualization of the milieu is dominated by the other cultural viewpoint. We suggest the concept of fertile zones of cultural encounter as a pedagogical approach to bridging the gap between cultures by designing interventions appreciated by members of both cultures, while also encouraging students to engage in the practices of the professional culture. We demonstrate the usefulness of such conceptualization in two school subjects: computer science and history.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Drawing upon sociocultural perspectives on learning and critical ethnographic research methods, we examine students' changing participation within middle school learning science. Our findings reveal the importance of ""place"" in how and why these youth pursue science learning. We argue that one way in which place shapes their learning is in how the youth take up science as both a context and a tool for change. We look at two interrelated kinds of changes within the classroom: crafting new forms of participation and new points on entry into the science learning community, and redefining the purpose of science activity. We also argue these instantiations of place in learning serve to connect the worlds of youth with the worlds of school science.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:28Z (GMT).

Results showed that a disagreement or contribution in the previous message yielded more disagreements and social cue displays in the current message. Unlike face-to-face discussions, online discussion messages that disagreed with a previous message elicited more responses.

In contrast, the likelihood of a CC was lower after a group member disagreed rudely or agreed. Meanwhile, group-level properties (racial diversity, gender diversity, and degree of status differences) did not significantly affect the likelihood of a CC. A CC was more likely after a justification in successful groups than in unsuccessful groups. CCs did not occur uniformly, as some time periods had many CCs while others had few CCs. Furthermore, agreements and correct evaluations had different effects across time periods within a group.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:30Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Two studies are reported in which two groups of students were compared. The control group learnt material from an iPod while sitting at a desk, and the experimental group learnt material from an iPod while riding on a exercise bike. Results reveal in the two studies that the control group outperformed the experimental group, suggesting that the second task interfered with learning. It seems that even though one could say that the two tasks do not use the same part of working memory and need not to be integrated, a split attention effect did occur.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:30Z (GMT).

Ioannides and Vosniadou's study in Greece demonstrated broad consistency in students' understandings of force. diSessa and colleague's quasi-replication in the U.S. demonstrated conflicting results supporting more elemental perspectives. One hypothesis focuses on differences in analytic methods. The other hypothesis focuses on semantic, cultural, or educational differences between the students in the two studies. The findings of this study suggest that differences in analytic methods do result in coding differences but that these relatively small differences would not account for the significant differences between the studies. This study, however, demonstrates significant differences for force meanings and knowledge structure coherence across the countries that might explain a larger percentage of the differences in findings between the studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:30Z (GMT).

In a randomized-design study conducted in a college chemistry class, we found that instruction that included diagrams created with this framework led to enhanced performance on open-ended transfer items compared to traditional instruction, particularly for low-performing students. We propose that a concept-based cognitive theory of multimedia learning that includes a conceptual working memory component may explain why the efficacy of diagrams depends heavily on the prior knowledge of the learner as well as the conceptual information available in the representation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:31Z (GMT).

This longitudinal study follows six elementary teachers in their early years of teaching. Five conceptions of effective science teaching are identified. In addition, though the teachers' beliefs are largely consistent over time--indicating that these are, indeed, central beliefs within their beliefs systems--a move away from reform-oriented practices is identified for most of the teachers in their third year of teaching.

In this paper, I use a set of principles for fostering productive engagement to explain how the Middle-school Mathematics through Applications Project (MMAP) got its team of researchers, teachers, and curriculum developers off to a good start. First, MMAP fostered problematizing around MMAP goals by recruiting participants whose goals partially overlapped with MMAP's, and by demonstrating the importance of core goals like equity. Second, the project supported teacher authority by selecting staff already inclined to respect teachers, by showing teachers that their contributions were desired, and by setting expectations that teachers would have the ultimate authority for how curricula would be used. Finally, MMAP fostered accountability by recruiting participants with varied expertise, setting expectations that teachers would change their teaching practices, and encouraging everyone to begin engaging in focused discussions with each other.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:32Z (GMT).

Also, experimentally-inspired practices of comparing theoretically contrasting interventions in parallel and systematically streamlining designs to distinguish between critical and less critical design elements have promise for being usefully adapted within design-based research studies themselves.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:32Z (GMT).

The model has helped each of us to account for gaps between intended and enacted sequences in relation to these artifacts. In particular, instrumental genesis provides a mechanism for differentiating between the designer's arc of intentionality and the student's learning trajectory, two vectors that may be tacitly aligned for historically evolved learning materials but at variance for recently created materials. Characteristic of our case studies--a networked-classroom design for functions and a mixed-media design for probability--are breakdowns in which students' behavior deviated either from the designer's intention or from classic models of constructivist design. In both cases, the breakdowns were valuable in that they occasioned refinement of our theories and designs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

With this problem in mind, we have begun research on how students are able to use resources (technology-based access to relevant information, social networks, simulations) in order to learn to solve problems. Our goal is to provide more valid measures of students' existing strengths as well as skills and knowledge that they need to learn.

We contest this work in two ways: (1) it reflects a misunderstanding of expert knowledge, and (2) reasoning by experts and novices often traverses ontological categories in both profes- sional and everyday contexts. We cite examples from research articles as well as classroom discussions to illustrate that experts as well as novices hop across ontological boundaries to make sense of physical phenomenon. This suggests a dynamic context-dependent model of a person's ontological view. To promote one ontological description in physics instruction, as suggested by Slotta and Chi, could suppress an essential skill for the development of exper- tise.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:35Z (GMT).

To test this possibility, we contrasted individuals who were instructed to self-explain problem-solving steps with dyads who were instructed to jointly explain problem-solving steps in the context of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). The results suggest that collaboratively developed explanations prompted students to remediate their errors in dialog, as opposed to relying on the ITS for assistance, which is provided in the form of on-demand hints.

While both groups were engaged in the task of collaborative writing, the CSCL group was supported by a web-based software Knowledge Forum whereas the control group created their articles via paper and pencil. During the research, observation notes were taken and students were interviewed. The results showed that students who worked with Knowledge Forum had significant gains in their writing performance compared with the control group. In addition, the students in Knowledge Forum were more motivated to write than the other group.

Environmental science and biology high school students learned to use tools designed to foster three specific metacognitive skills: recognizing text structure, reflecting on content, and representing the gist of a text in a summary. During one school year, students had regular opportunities to use these strategies in class. Participants completed one tool use assessment at the end of the school year in which they used the tools during reading of a science text. Students then answered science comprehension questions about the text. Tool proficiency was correlated with both reading and science achievement. Tool proficiency also predicted science achievement when controlling for on-entry reading ability. The implications for science instruction are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Based on these ideas a prototype of the ChatIC tool was developed and evaluated with three coding schemes. For two coding schemes a sufficient inter-rater agreement between a human coder and the learning algorithms was reached.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

First, they should support situative embodiment in academic knowledge, where personally meaningful activities and coherent narratives foster collective engagement. Second, they should offer multiple levels and forms of meaningful assessment and the opportunity to succeed, fail, and try again. Third, they should provide useful feedback that is used to enhance participation, learning, and curricula. These principles were developed in three annual design-based refinements of a 15- hour ecological sciences gaming curriculum in nine upper elementary classes. Across years, the situative embodiment afforded by the curriculum was refined with informal assessment, and innovative virtual formative feedback was incorporated around a key curricular activity. Results across years revealed incremental improvements in participation, understanding of key concepts, and achievement of targeted standards. The ultimate gains in understanding and achievement were larger than those in comparison classrooms that used a conventional text-based curriculum covering the same concepts and standards.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:37Z (GMT).

A control group did not engage in any follow-up activity for learning from text. As expected, learners profited most from studying the correct worked-out map. Students who corrected an incorrect worked-out map did not have a better learning result than students who generated concept maps on their own or the control group.

This study explores the nature of this people knowledge and its possible effects on science learning. There are two types of people knowledge identified through this study: breadth-oriented people knowledge (BPK) and depth-oriented people knowledge (DPK). BPK profiles scientists' scientific achievements across life whereas DPK describes scientists' intellectual struggle in relation to their theory building. The findings indicate that the two types of people knowledge are fundamentally different in nature and it is only DPK that is beneficial to science learning (e.g., deepening students' understanding of scientific theories and making science learning environments more humanly interesting).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:37Z (GMT).

The course assignment consisted of participating into seven different discussion topics using Optima, an asynchronous learning environment. The discussions were used to examine communication networks during the course. Social network analysis techniques were used to explore communication networks and changes in these networks at structural and dyadic levels in four discrete time points with the effects of degree, reciprocity, transitivity and 3-cycles modeled by using the conditional method of moments. The results of the study suggest that during a virtual course the participants tend to form subgroups and hierarchical structures as in the same way as any other social community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:38Z (GMT).

In this paper we present a theoretical investigation of the use of pen-based computing in large lectures (&gt;150 students). In particular, through this case study we examined how the combined use of Tablet PCs and the interactive software DyKnow creates a learning environment that is conducive to student participation and learning. We argue that these technologies enable participation by facilitating creation, sharing, recording, and reflecting of representations. Although the ideas presented in this paper are primarily theoretical, we do find supporting evidence through in-class (N=100 to 250) and online surveys (N = 525) of engineering freshmen at Virginia Tech.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:39Z (GMT).

Yet this has proven challenging to do. How can schools replicate authentic science experiences in the classroom? This paper reports on the benefits of using Multi-user Virtual Environments to create authentic science experiences for middle-school students that allow them to engage in the processes of scientists. Our research indicates that low self-efficacy students and those with poor initial knowledge do as well as those with average self-efficacy and better than those learning with more traditional inquiry pedagogies. High self-efficacy students, however, do better with the traditional inquiry methods.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:40Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Applying cognitive load theory, the limitations of the working memory capacity at the individual level were considered an important reason to assign complex learning tasks to groups rather than to individuals. It was hypothesized that groups will have more processing capacity available for relating the information elements to each other and by doing so for constructing higher quality cognitive schemata than individuals if the high cognitive load imposed by complex learning tasks could be shared among group members. In contrast, it was expected that individuals who learn from carrying out the same complex tasks would need all available processing capacity for remembering the interrelated information elements, and, consequently, would not be able to allocate resources to working with them. This interaction hypothesis was confirmed by the data on efficiency of retention and transfer test performance; there was a favorable relationship between mental effort and retention test performance for the individual learners as opposed to a favorable relationship between transfer test performance and mental effort for the students who learned in groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:41Z (GMT).

We empirically investigated the effects of two differently structured external scripts on the structural quality of written and oral arguments produced in dyads with either low or high structured internal scripts. External scripts were presented in a written mode at specific instances in a web-based inquiry learning environment.

Results indicated that experimental students made more gains than comparison students on both conceptual and epistemological measures.

The study revealed three different context types that were built through the students' discourse. The students' prior knowledge (socio-cultural context) as well as local context, for example earlier discussion with the teacher, served as main resources which the students drew on in their immediate context. In the immediate context, a co-text, such as a written text or an earlier discussion, made up the complete shared context for reasoning and enabled collaborating in the task. The study demonstrated how the discourse both reflected and constructed the context in which it was used.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper we examine the role of argumentation and of explanation development in dyadic dialogues and their relation to consequential individual conceptual change. Two quantitative dialogue coding schemes were developed with different granularity: The first assessed the interlocutors' dialog moves during the discussion that pertained to argumentation and explanation development. The second scheme characterized the dialogue as a whole on a number of social and socio-cognitive dimensions. The results emphasized the critical role of engagement in dialectical argumentation for conceptual change, whereas explanation development and validation was not related to learning gains. This finding may explain why instructional interventions are too often insufficient to uproot robust misconceptions. The methodological implications for the study of conceptual change, as well as the practical implications for designing for productive argumentation are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:42Z (GMT).

The findings, analyzed within the framework of semiotic ideology, support a broader proposition that literacy programs, and the technologies used in them, can serve as forcible mediators of people's understandings of what languages, signs and sociocultural identifications are.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:43Z (GMT).

We describe a research project in which together with teachers, we initiated lesson activities that enact RCKB for science lessons. Towards that goal, we envisaged 10 principles for RCKB in the design of lessons, and worked with teachers to co-design lesson plans and apply these principles.

To investigate the long-term effects of prompts, we conducted a longitudinal study. Students (N = 50) wrote journal entries about weekly seminar sessions over a whole term. The experimental group received cognitive and metacognitive prompts for their writing. The control group received a non-specific instruction without prompts. The prompts proved to be effective in the short term.

The agent condition was told that the virtual representation was a computer program. All interactions within VR were held constant, but the avatar conditions exhibited better learning, more attention, and higher arousal.

Furthermore, due to the increase of ICT older adults will be more and more confronted with multimedia applications that are not tailored to this specific user group and might therefore not be as efficient as they could be. A design that combines adjustments towards the physical decline and adapts cognitive load theory to minimise cognitive overload embedded in an authentic context provides a fruitful basis for learning environments addressing older adults. However, situated learning approaches vary widely in the support given to the learner and the aim is to establish a framework that enables instructional designers to administer the appropriate amount of support for the special abilities and needs of older adults.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:34Z (GMT).

We describe the emergence of the use and effect of this technical artefact by building on Rabardel's (1995) concept of instrumental genesis. From this perspective, a tool or instrument is seen as a mixed functional unit composed of an artefact and a utilisation scheme. We view tool appropriation as a constructive utilisation of the artefact. In case of collaborative tool use this utilisation has to be coordinated. We examine tool appropriation in a collaborative setting as development over three stages. In order to construct their project plan the students had to arrive at a shared representational format. We hypothesized that they would make certain choices during a stage of personal utilisation, and would then coordinate these choices to arrive at a shared convention of use. Our analysis illustrates a transition from mastery to collective utilisation of the tool.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Further, the size of the class and the effect of the level of multicultural heterogeneity to the tie distribution were studied. All analyses were made at class level. Surprisingly, no remarkable differences were found. The size of the class was found as an important factor influencing on the amount of exclusionary ties. The multicultural heterogeneity did not either have big influence on the composition of different types of social ties. The sample is large (738 children, 50 school classes) and therefore, the results can be generalized to similar cultural environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:34Z (GMT).

Policy researchers have defined coherence in terms of alignment of standards, curriculum, and assessment is key to supporting implementation, while teacher learning researchers have analyzed coherence as an aspect of teachers' perception influenced by features of their professional development. This paper presents an expanded model of coherence that focuses on teachers' perception of alignment of curriculum materials that are the focus of professional development and on the fit of the materials to their local school context. Using empirical data from a state-wide systemic inquiry science reform effort targeting students from kindergarten to eighth grade, we describe how these two factors influenced teachers' global perceptions of the coherence of their professional development activities and subsequent implementation of curriculum materials.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:35Z (GMT).

In this study, students (21 humanities students, 14 biology students) had to solve five tasks of different complexity (Anderson et al., 2001) with a hypertext on ""genetic fingerprinting"". Results indicate that students adapted their concurrent thoughts and concurrent actions to task complexity in this enactment stage.

Several navigation support techniques, such as link suggestions, have been proposed to reduce cognitive load. In an experiment we tested the effects of number of links and link suggestions on cognitive load and learning. Participants used different hypertext versions, 3-links or 8-links per page, and with link suggestions or not. Participants with navigational support selected a more coherent reading text order and learned better at situational level. More interestingly, the effects on cognitive load were mediated by the hypertext reading order. Participants that selected a low coherent reading order suffered more cognitive load independently of the number of links presented.

This study analyzed the argumentation practices of middle school students conducting an earth science inquiry project using data visualization tools. Analysis of spoken and gestural interactions during small-group work of one group of students in each of three classrooms revealed three common modes in which students employed visual data in argumentation: (1) using data-referenced talk and gesture to challenge authoritative positioning; (2) using gesture to participate in argumentation with incomplete conceptual vocabulary; and (3) using argumentation about data as a means of co-constructing the goals of academic tasks.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:38Z (GMT).

However, they sometimes over-focus on the narrative, failing to integrate critical quantitative information effectively. The Numerically Driven Inferencing (NDI) paradigm's research (e.g., Ranney et al., 2001; Munnich, Ranney, &amp; Appel, 2004) suggested that a curricular module highlighting evidential/scientific thinking might enhance reporters' quantitative and analytic skills. The resulting controlled experiment involved 55 first-year journalism graduate students, our ""Numbers, News, and Evidence"" module, 4.5 classroom hours, 20 homework hours, and several (e.g., Pre-, Mid- and Final-test) assessments. Post-module findings indicate success: Relative to control data, the experimental group improved on the main numeracy measures: 1) estimation accuracy and 2) math competence involving simple problem solving, data analyses, and exponential growth. Students and faculty both concluded that future students should also receive numeracy modules. The module apparently influenced students' attitudes about numerical information, too. The collective results may benefit journalists, their instructors, and media consumers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study of 100 online summer course participants indicates that the willingness to contribute to discourse depends on the type of motivation.

Findings indicate that by integrating approaches from the Learning Sciences and the Instructional Systems Design worlds, the instructional model developed in this study supported students to design pedagogically sound educational technologies. An ""anchoring stage"", in which students shift from philosophical to practical design was found as a crucial stage in student learning.

We found that students of teachers who used SimCalc learned more. In this paper, we look specifically at the issue of cognitive complexity through a case study of two teachers, contextualizing the case study within aggregate data. Aspects of the theme of cognitive complexity can be seen in (a) student performance on different types of test items (b) teachers' report of their own daily teaching goals and (c) discourse patterns in different classrooms. Although this analysis is preliminary, it reveals the potential of understanding Learning Science-based interventions more fully by combining large-scale and case study data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:39Z (GMT).

These attempts involve an implicit assumption that the character and function of all intuitive knowledge is the same that there is a single kind of thing called ""intuitive science knowledge"" that can be singularly characterized. The purpose of this work is to call that assumption into question, and we present examples to highlight our concerns.

Previous results showed that the awareness tool positively affected learning gain by enhancing the production of elaborative talk and knowledge negotiation. In the present paper, we describe the actual use of a knowledge awareness tool during the course of interaction by analyzing the gaze paths recorded during the experiment and how they relate to learning performance and verbal interactions. The results showed that learners refer to the knowledge awareness tool episodically during the course of collaboration, mainly to assess the epistemic value of the information provided by the peer, especially when the peer seems uncertain about his understanding.

A pilot study that compares question prompts with self-reflection prompts within the agent environment is undertaken. Question prompts are more specific and concrete questions related to the tutor's teaching and in which the student tutor needs to respond. Self-reflection prompts are more general prompts to stimulate self-reflection.

Students and teachers succeeded in collaborative knowledge construction, and individual students demonstrated impressive learning gains.

In order to understand how place-based pedagogies affect learning and how locative technologies, like Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Augmented Reality Games on Handhelds (ARGHs), help connect learners to cultures of place I examine experiences with place-based video games in a deep woods camping environment. Drawing together research in sociocultural learning, design, embodiment, environmental education, experiential education, human geography, and video games, this paper demonstrates how ARGHs can restructure a learning activity to (1) better connect learners to place, (2) increase and mediate their physical activity and social interactions, and (3) help enculturate them into a community of practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:42Z (GMT).

In order to assess the sustainability of the learning environment a subgroup of subjects (n = 52) was compared with a comparable group of students who did not participate in the experiment (n = 145) with respect to their performance in a regular multiple choice test. Results show that the acquisition of diagnostic knowledge is mainly fostered by providing erroneous examples in combination with elaborated feedback.

Through a lens of activity theory, our analysis suggests that test-oriented scientific method did not support authentic scientific inquiry. Instead, this focus served to draw teachers' attention away from student thinking and distract students from their ongoing, productive inquiry. By situating the case in a broader institutional and social context, we discuss how the teaching and learning of the scientific method as inquiry is supported and sustained in our current educational system.

Contrary to our expectations, group performance and capability did not improve uniformly over time, but fluctuated from episode to episode, leading us to examine what seemed to influence this fluctuation. We discovered that the character of group discussions and the impact of those discussions on the group's reasoning about the case were strong indicators of group performance and capability.

System dynamics models provide a top-down aggregated representation of a system with an emphasis on understanding time delays and feedback. Agent-based models provide a bottom- up representation, using animation, allowing system-level concepts to emerge from the interaction between individuals. Their joint use is becoming more common among scientists researching complex systems.

This analysis is demonstrated through its application to a set of dialogues taken from 2 groups of medical students who, as part of their professional training, were asked to explain the medical ethics engendered by two patient cases. The analysis shows that the learners strengthen their existing conceptual knowledge, rather than acquire new conceptual knowledge, and specifically that they make valuable new connections between structurally similar episodes, and between concepts and specific facts of the case.

Some experiments reported improved recall after problem- based group discussions. However, these experiments did not control for individual differences in prior knowledge and quality of discussions. This experiment aimed to keep these variables under control. 62 students were trained on a physical topic (waves). One week later, they observed a video-recorded problem-based group discussion. In the experimental condition, students observed a discussion relevant to the trained material and verbally participated. In two control conditions, students either observed the relevant or an irrelevant discussion, without participating verbally. Then, all participants studied a relevant text. Immediate and delayed cued recall measures were taken. The experimental group was expected to recall more correct propositions than both control groups. A preliminary analysis with a one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between the conditions on the delayed, but not on the immediate measure. A tentative conclusion therefore is that the verbal participation improved long-term recall.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, so far the literature failed to find clear benefits of animated diagrams. Consequently it is worthwhile to investigate conditions under which enhancement of learning occurs. In the present study interactivity of the display and spatial ability of learners were examined. Three modes of presentation were compared: static diagrams, animation with interactivity, and animation with focus, also combined with interactivity. The interactive animation condition with focus acquired more knowledge than the other two conditions while the interactive animation condition scored worst. High-spatial ability subjects performed better on the knowledge acquisition measures than low-ability subjects. The interactive animation condition with focus is particularly beneficial for low- spatial ability subjects. These results indicate that combining the conditions of interactivity and focus does lead to improvement in learning from animations, particularly for low-spatial ability subjects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:46Z (GMT).

We describe a three-dimensional framework for comparing innovative project-like scenarios in technology curricula to more traditional instructional sequences for science learning. We subsequently developed a dissociated geometry-oriented and an integrated technology-oriented CAD training and studied their influence on the way pupils engaged in a design task. Although the results show evidence of the complementary roles of different types of representations, no effect of type of CAD training is found. In the discussion, we propose potential explanations for these findings, by relating back to our framework, and make a suggestion for future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:46Z (GMT).

In this study, the GCC framework is extended to the VMT chat medium which consists of a shared whiteboard, chat message box and tools for students to construct mathematical representations. The analyses of these sessions were based on the Collaboration Interaction Model (CIM), a model designed to study the knowledge construction process of complex chat transcripts. This paper will discuss how participants mediate shared understanding of mathematical representations and form mathematical arguments to construct new knowledge in the chat medium, using the CIM as the key instrument of analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:47Z (GMT).

Sequential observation and content analysis were used to identify themes emerging in the discussion. Results revealed that although children came to the boards mainly for seeking help and asking questions, discussions around different curriculum subjects (Maths and English) were structured differently. Because of children's limited skills in asking questions, the boards had limited value for learning conversations.

Group meetings were observed and interviews were carried out with the group members. A visible, if sometimes subtle, difference between the challenges facing biologists and those facing physicists was identified. Physicists encountered difficulties in grasping the biological knowledge organization; while biologists found the models suggested by physicists over simplistic.

In studying the meaning making process of a group of students doing Problem-based Learning, our findings show that authoritative sources played an important role in deepening and expanding students' scientific knowledge. We also found that constructive use of authoritative sources involves interpretation of meaning in context.

Students found it useful for learning. However, encouraging sustained participation was challenging because students tended to view the GOP as a static source, rather than a participatory and editable resource. Expert analysis of the student's contributions to the ontology found them to be useful and significant.

The analysis suggests how questions and responses are produced and understood. It also explicates the variety of roles questions can play in the organization of participation and learning in such a collaborative math problem-solving setting.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:48Z (GMT).

Physics students (N=148) in six diverse high schools studied the module and responded to pretests, posttests, and embedded assessments. We scored students' experimentation using three methods: total number of trials, how widely students changed variables between trials (variability), and how well students connected content knowledge to experimentation strategies (validity). Students made large, significant overall pretest to posttest gains. Regression models showed that validity was the strongest predictor of learning when controlling for prior knowledge and other experimentation measures. Successful learners employed a goal-directed experimentation approach that connected their experimentation strategy to content knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:49Z (GMT).

Players progressively engage the epistemological entailments of charged particles through new phenomena they encounter as the game unfolds. We engineered discretely bounded gaming episodes to arrange transitions between game play, small group, and whole class discussions. Together, these elements of game play and discussion constitute recurring, game-centered dialogic activity cycles. Through this design, we investigate how gaming fosters intuitive physics understandings, how activity structures and materials engage learners and enlist gaming experiences in discussion, and how both game play and discussion shape subsequent participation. Analyses of trajectories of participation in and across cycles underscore the plausibility of this approach while also illuminating emerging tensions that we discuss in terms of epistemic reflexivity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:49Z (GMT).

Study 2 aimed to support these patterns of collaborative reasoning in a training phase, and tested the effects of support in a test phase. Two support measures were realized: written information on task difficulties and collaboration strategies, and an inference tutoring tool providing feedback and prompts based on an online assessment of students' collaboration.

Second, we investigated the effects of knowledge interdependence with the partner on transactivity in collaborative concept mapping. We found that the degree to which participants co-manipulate the same objects in the collaborative map (action transactivity) is higher when they discussed identical (rather than complementary) information. Results from eye-gaze data showed that participants who shared complementary information transitioned more frequently between their own map and their partner's map; eye-movement transitions between own and peer maps were also negatively correlated with learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:51Z (GMT).

This model assumes that individual learning and collaborative knowledge building are based on the interplay between people's knowledge and the information available in the wiki. This interplay takes place in the form of externalization and internalization respectively. Individual learning is considered as happening through internal processes of assimilation and accommodation. Collaborative knowledge building happens through activities of external assimilation and accommodation. This study demonstrates these four processes in an experimental setting. As postulated by Cress and Kimmerle, the results show that a medium level of incongruity between people's knowledge and a wiki's information supports individual learning. A medium level of incongruity also leads to more external accommodation processes, despite the fact that high and medium levels of incongruity result in the same amount of text complements.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:51Z (GMT).

Worked-out examples have been shown to be an effective complement to untutored problem solving, but it is largely unknown whether they are an effective complement to tutored problem solving. Further, while computer-based learning environments offer the possibility of adaptively transitioning from examples to problems while tailoring to an individual learner, the effectiveness of such machine-adapted example fading is largely unstudied. To address these issues, two studies were conducted which compared a standard Cognitive Tutor with two example-enhanced Cognitive Tutors. The results indicate that adaptively fading worked-out examples leads to the highest transfer performance on delayed post-tests compared to the other two methods.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:34Z (GMT).

Immediately after interacting with the visualization students overestimated their understanding compared to their self-assessments after giving an explanation. Analysis suggests that generating explanations can help students identify weaknesses in their understanding of dynamic visualizations and develop more coherent views.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:41Z (GMT).

The papers that will be presented as part of this symposium will focus on three different phenomena: argumentation, production feedback and the incubation effect of collaboration. In addition, these studies also show that the effects of collaborative learning may not be apparent immediately following interaction, but need some time to materialize. This finding emphasizes the need for multiple and delayed assessment, as well as alternative assessment tools, such as prospective (instead of retrospective) measures of learning. .","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:42Z (GMT).

Recently, there is an increased emphasis on learning that occurs outside formal institutions, especially through the use of technology. Design experiments and design-based research have resulted in several innovations and in an overall conception of designing and researching new learning environments. Not surprisingly, technology has been a critical component of research and teaching. Yet, this focus has primarily been on developed nations in the West. Recently the participation from other areas of the world, especially Africa, Asia, the Middle East, has been on the increase while the community of researchers and scholars is internationalizing. One area of innovation that has not been part of the community but which we wish to bring to focus through our symposium is the use of information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) in emerging economies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:45Z (GMT).

Wikis, for example, have popularized a social approach to constructing knowledge that was very difficult to achieve with previous technologies. Social networking applications like Facebook that interconnect people according to social or semantic relationships have become integral features of student life. Multi-user synchronous environments like Second Life provide rich, immersive experiences as well as new forms of online community. Such applications are blooming in every corner of society, influencing the ways in which people learn and exchange with one another. These four papers present distinct research applications of such technologies, illustrating how they influence not only our methods, but affect the very nature of our questions and theoretical perspectives.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:45Z (GMT).

What are the profiles of successful and less successful ways of learning about complex systems conceptual perspectives? Can complex systems provide conceptual perspectives for cognitively ""seeing"" physical and social sciences subjects in new and interconnected ways?

Using them can lead to a deeper level of cognitive processing when learners make mental transformations between representations. However, research has revealed two problems. First, it has been shown that learners often do not make spontaneous use of such multiple options. Second, the translation process is often difficult. The papers presented in this symposium aim at supporting learners' use of multiple representations as well as their translation process. The first study provided learners with different types of representations and asked them to translate those into other representations. The second study examined the effectiveness of contextual scaffolds in computer simulations.The third study aimed at supporting hypermedia learning with multiple representations by means of metacognitive modelling and prompting of representational awareness. The fourth study investigated if sequencing dynamic representations combined with explicit instruction to relate and translate between representations has a positive effect on learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:49Z (GMT).

The class of methods discussed here looks at processes of learning in fine-grained detail, through which a theoretical framework evolves rather than is merely applied. This class of methodological orientations to studying learning processes diverges from more common ones in several important ways: 1) Attention to diverse features of the learning interaction; 2) conducting a moment-by-moment analysis, zooming in on the fine details of the studied processes; 3) rather than proving or applying a theory, the objective is to make theoretical innovations, or to develop a ""humble theory."" The challenge of using such techniques is that, by their nature, they do not follow a strongly delineated procedure, especially not the usual sort of coding. This symposium attempts to begin addressing the methodological issues by reflecting on several cases of data analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These efforts have been aligned through the development and institution of Construct-Centered Design (CCD), a principled process that is based largely on evidence-centered assessment design (Mislevy, Steinberg, Almond, Haertel, &amp; Penuel, 2003) and learning goal-driven design (Krajcik, McNeill &amp; Reiser, 2007).

Fading implies to tailor support for collaboration, such as collaboration scripts, to the particular needs of the specific collaborators. In computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) settings, support can be designed in a very restrictive and inflexible fashion; at the same time computerized settings open new possibilities for the realization of adaptive support as they enable automation of analysis and feedback mechanisms. In this symposium we present new technical approaches and latest empirical research on possibilities and limitations of adaptive support for learners in CSCL settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:51Z (GMT).

In this symposium we will use the term ""cognitive convergence"" to encompass various concepts that have been used to explain the important processes underlying successful collaboration, such as intersubjectivity, co- construction, knowledge convergence, common ground, joint problem space, and transactive reasoning. The goal of the symposium is to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive convergence and to relate cognitive convergence to individual learning outcomes. We include studies that emphasize detailed analyses of the mechanisms, provide ideas about how to conceptualize and measure convergence, and include qualitative and quantitative measures of shared and converging learning outcomes. A special emphasis will be on methodological questions about how to analyze the processes of achieving convergence and how to assess how convergence affects outcomes of collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:53Z (GMT).

Gamestar Mechanic is an RPG (Role-Playing Game) style online game through which players ""take on"" the behaviors characteristic of professional game designers (e.g., designing games, accounting for variability change within a game's system, critiquing games). Reflecting on and practicing design can lead, we believe, to skills that are crucial for success in the modern, high-tech, global world. Game design is but a start in learning to think of complex interactions among variables, people, and technology, but it is also a domain that can help others reflect on complex interactions among systems. Early findings are showing that the pedagogical design of Gamestar Mechanic has the potential to help participants develop understanding of technical concepts particular to game design, systems-thinking skills, and other behaviors associated with the domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:53Z (GMT).

Specifically, each project describes students' successes and challenges in creating complex virtual artifacts and collaborating in real time with peers and the broader community. The design-based research studies of mathematical and computational literacy present sample student artifacts and discuss the learning they evidence. Collectively, we posit that overcoming the following obstacles could make virtual worlds both effective and exciting learning environments: professional development (technical skill, affective disposition), collaboration with school systems (logistics of access, allocation of resources), alignment with targeted content (harnessing students' creative divergence), and initial learning curves (issues of teacher-to-student ratio).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:54Z (GMT).

However, challenges still exist. For example, how do different modeling tools and learning activities shape student learning trajectories? How do they impact student science learning? What are the assessment measures that can serve as formative and/or summative purposes in the different learning environments? This symposium introduces how computer-based MVT (i.e., NetLogo, Biologica, and Astronomicon) were integrated into different learning environments, and highlights how alternative and formative assessment measures have been used for assessing student learning progression and outcomes. The symposium concludes with some general principles for designing MVT enhanced learning environments and understanding of models and modelling as assessment toolkits to gain an insight into student conceptual development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:55Z (GMT).

To meet these concerns while enabling the use of handhelds, we devise and test empirically the value of shared visual context in creating common ground by examining communication efficiency.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:58Z (GMT).

While knowledge and skills can explain how people find a new path when confronted with a difficulty (a fault-driven adaptation), something else is needed to explain when and why people make a beneficial, but unnecessary change (a prospective adaptation). In an interview, participants gave examples of adaptations from their everyday lives. Their examples appeared to arise from aesthetic judgments, not from a conceptual understanding of the domain. These findings suggest that values and aesthetics ought to be a more explicit focus of research on adaptive expertise.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:47:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1
