The study explores the benefits of learning science concepts before or during a design project. Based on the NGSS science and engineering practices, in an engineering condition, students learn the necessary science concepts during a design project. In a science condition, students learn the science concepts first, then apply them during a design project. The study explores the benefits of each approach to inform instructional design. We use the knowledge integration framework to develop curriculum and assessment items, including an interactive computer model of a solar oven. Using three types of pre/posttest assessment items, we found students in both conditions gained insights on science and engineering design items; students in the engineering condition outperformed the science condition on a science-design integration item and conducted more trials during the design process while using an interactive computer model.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:04Z (GMT).

While the network as a whole can be successful, implementations in individual schools differ, resulting in large variations in the depth and reach of the changes that take place at the school level. This study investigates two schools in a DBIN that demonstrated similar trajectories of change in the first two years, but very different outcomes at the end of the third year. The findings show that the fine grain details of the architecture for and leadership engagement in within- and cross-school learning, and the quality of the school-based learning interactions matter in determining the implementation outcomes of schools in the same DBIN.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:05Z (GMT).

In this paper, we introduce Causal Alignment Analysis (CAA), a framework for data-informed,iterative design of teacher awareness tools, which links the design of awareness tools to educational goals. We illustrate the usefulness of CAA with a case study, demonstrating the successful design alignment of an awareness tool with a causal path from teacher tool use to student learning. Over a sequence of four pilot studies conducted in both simulated and live classrooms, we demonstrate the iterative refinement of Lumilo, a real-time awareness tool, to draw teachers’ attention towards students who may benefit most from a teacher’s help.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:06Z (GMT).

Here, we present a study conducted with thirty-six learning sciences experts and practitioners who were asked to judge the potential effectiveness of eighty collaborative learning activities using an adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ) approach. The results of the ACJ process show that the most innovative and effective collaborative learning activities are those that are monitored but not formally assessed. In addition, the use of technology and explicit support of students’ social and problem-solving skills are identified as important features of innovative collaborative learning activities that are likely to be effective. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents features of innovative collaborative learning practice that are considered to be important for effectiveness by experts. Second, it provides an ‘innovative’ research approach to assess educational practice when teaching is considered as a design science rather than a theoretical science.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:08Z (GMT).

On the other hand, analysis of student dialogues can be time consuming and subjective. In this paper, we propose combining log data, student dialogue, and gaze analysis to provide a clearer picture of how students construct knowledge collaboratively while working with an intelligent tutoring system. We found that students’ gaze similarity is negatively correlated with levels of abstraction in speech and that students have higher gaze similarity surrounding feedback provided by the tutor. These results show that the gaze data can be used as a proxy for dialogue in a collaborative learning context.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this study, we leverage a design experiment developed with two low-income neighborhoods, to facilitate science learning across the everyday settings of these communities. We focus our analysis here, on how different actors facilitated a common practice that arose organically – probing learners for their understanding – and how that practice moved across different social and material configurations of the neighborhoods. As this practice was taken up by different actors – teachers, parents, and others – we observed the different variations of this practice that learners may experience. By understanding practices on the move, we argue that smart and connected learning ecosystems will require more nuanced noticing, coordination, and layering of different flavors of a practice that can be taken up by a network of actors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:10Z (GMT).

Our analysis not only illuminates the capability of portfolios to capture computational practices and certain concepts, but also reveals students’ lack of effective use of non-textual evidence in their narrations. We consider the affordances and limitations of portfolios for supporting student reflection and metacognition of their own learning as well improvements that could be made to scaffold students’ communication and use of visual evidence in more effective ways.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:10Z (GMT).

Results indicated that the retrieval practice activity induced cognitive conflict in learners who had misconceptions, and learners who received subsequent prompts to explain the correct answers had significantly higher posttest scores than students who read refuting explanations. We suggest that self-explaining is a particularly effective revision task for online Biology courses, where students may not actively engage with the refuting explanations that are used in classroom-based conceptual change instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:11Z (GMT).

In this paper, we present a fully autonomous robot for middle school math; we iterate through three design phases and analyze responses to identify how to better foster productive social experiences for self-efficacy. We report six design recommendations; for example, for low self-efficacy individuals, an ideal design should incorporate problem-solving statements and positivity to foster social experiences of mastery and social persuasion.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:11Z (GMT).

Drawing on an ethnography of families’ media engagement, this paper examines the nature of young people’s assigned tasks at home. Through analysis of interactions between children, parents, the home setting, and material resources, we develop a theory of learning that accounts for how newer and older technological forms are reassembled in everyday tasks like homework and chores. We discuss how, through mixing media, repurposing space, and remote assistance families make home “work” with technology. These reassembly processes collapse tools, nesting old and new media together in ways that are increasingly relevant for designing learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:12Z (GMT).

This study presents an analysis of teachers’ practice in the second of three years of professional development aimed at helping them learn to enact instruction aligned with the NGSS. The analysis focuses on changes to how teachers organize whole class discussions, looking particularly at how teachers support student-student dialogue. Comparing discussions from spot observations of teaching to PD-supported lessons, data suggest teachers struggle in both contexts to support productive student-student talk, although they are modestly more successful in the PD context. Conclusions from this analysis include that PD should provide clear models of productive discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We explored students’ use of epistemic criteria before and after the intervention. We found that students were able to generate and use a variety of epistemic criteria even before the intervention. Yet they improved in their ability to invoke fit-with-evidence as an epistemic criterion, a central criterion in modeling and argumentation. Our data suggest that students developed in their understanding of which criteria are prioritized in scientific practice—i.e., a meta-epistemic understanding of the utility and importance of epistemic criteria.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:12Z (GMT).

The findings were more mixed for the remaining efforts to develop completion badges (for individuals completing projects or investigations) and hybrid badges (for multiple types of learning). This suggests that innovators temper their ambition for capturing and recognizing evidence of individual competencies, and consider exploring more social assessments and informal and crowdsourced recognition","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:14Z (GMT).

More recently, the design of software and hardware tools have been investigated as potentially contributing to the gender gap, and a new class of tools designed with gender in mind have risen to prominence. This study compared one such tool-the Adafruit Flora, an electronic textiles platform-to a comparable platform that was not designed with gender in mind-the Arduino Leonardo. While there were some shifts in self-identification, the most notable result was that the participants' views of computing and arts became less stereotyped. However, there was no meaningful difference between workshops in this regard. Our results indicate that the relationship between e-textiles and gender may be more complicated than previously thought.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:14Z (GMT).

We report on a comparison of two distinct instructional interventions informed by the same genetics progression that were implemented with introductory biology students (10th and 11th grades). The interventions targeted the ideas in the LP but differ in the: (1) sequencing of instruction, (2) focus phenomena, and (3) activities. To determine the learning paths for each instructional intervention we used causal model search and path analyses to explore relationships within and between these ideas. Our findings may indicate that the two instructional contexts result in maps that have both differences and similarities providing further evidence about the strengths of conjectures in LPs.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:15Z (GMT).

Students in the critique condition explain what is wrong or missing from several common non-normative student ideas regarding difficult topics in genetics. We compare this to a method used in the past to encourage students to add new ideas to their essays; students in the revisit condition are directed back to relevant information and interactive models rather than practicing critique. Students in the critique condition were more likely to revise their essays at all, especially students with low prior knowledge.

Yet, in the years since their writing, the field has advanced significantly in its articulation of power in relation to learning. Students’ disciplinary engagement is not only dependent on how they author, share or convince others of their ideas, but also how such practices invoke issues of power. This suggests a need to revise the framework to engage specifically with what are now readily understood as racialized, classed, and gendered dimensions of learning. In this paper, we bring the issues of power to the forefront to explore the equity potential of the PDE framework. This preliminary move – which centers on the promise of positioning as a principle – is a starting point for the field in working toward a more integrated understanding of power and disciplinary learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:16Z (GMT).

How to design such systems is of fundamental importance because the design influences students’ learning processes (deJong, Linn & Zacharia, 2013). We examined the impact of the design of the modeling interface on learning, using two designs that differ in the type of visual feedback and the degrees of freedom for exploration. We found that neither of the designs was categorically better; rather, they were conducive to different forms of engagement in the inquiry activity, each offering distinct affordances for learning. This suggests that designers of technology for science inquiry need to be explicit about desired learning goals and forms of engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:16Z (GMT).

A series of multilevel models were used to explore the independent effects of these factors on teacher use of technology in general and for different teaching purposes. The results showed that teachers’ technology self-efficacy was a significant predictor of teacher use of technology in general.

The key designs included students engaging in idea-driven discourse on Knowledge Forum augmented with epistemic talk and reflection, and linking the understanding of their own inquiry process with scientists’ inquiry. Results indicated that students changed towards more sophisticated views of science from concrete-absolutist to evolving views of science.  Analysis of classroom events illustrated how students reflected on their inquiry and KF discourse in relation to epistemic features of scientific practice, and developing the notions that they can be little scientists emulating the practice of scientists.

Because cooperative modern board games combine motivating gameplay and designs that align with elements from Cooperative Learning Theory, they may enhance cooperative attitudes and perspective taking skills.  In this pre-test/post-test quasi-experiment, middle school students played either a cooperative or competitive board game.  Students who played and highly enjoyed the cooperative game showed significantly greater increases in perspective taking skills after gameplay (F=11.42, p=.001), suggesting that playing enjoyable cooperative modern board games may be associated with increased perspective taking skills.  Our findings suggest the need for further investigation into board games as a low-cost platform for students to practice SEL skills outside of the formal classroom environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:20Z (GMT).

Here, we draw on data from three different studies of maker-based activities to explore the following question: What forms of collaboration are made possible in maker activities? In asking how collaboration develops through making we shift from collaboration as a design feature of learning environments to both a process and an outcome of learning. We take up an emergent perspective on collaboration focusing on the collaborative interactions that occur naturalistically in maker activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:21Z (GMT).

Informed by a distributed cognition perspective and using a combination of qualitative categorical coding and interaction analysis, this study provides a learning sciences approach to studying spatial thinking and learning.  Analyses show that during making activities students engaged in frequent and diverse spatial thinking with a variety of social and material resources and that the sociomaterial contexts of different making activities facilitated different types of spatial thinking.

Extant research on the efficacy of drawing for promoting learning from dynamic visualizations is contradictory. The discrepancy in these findings has been attributed to the differences between drawing and dynamic visualizations. While dynamic visualizations emphasize spatiotemporal transformations, drawing emphasizes static spatiotemporal structures. Thus, drawing may impede learning from a dynamic visualization when the target learning objective relates to dynamism as it may bias the learner to focus on structure at the expense of transformation. Here, we present our developing findings that drawing provides an effective learning scaffold for learning from dynamic visualizations more so than self-explanation prompts, and that drawing biases learners to attend to fewer spatiotemporal structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:23Z (GMT).

Here we present findings on students’ roles as co-designers and how that influenced their learning and engagement. Furthermore, we discuss issues of accessibility in designing activities in terms of physical and computational affordances. Regardless of prior experience, students were more engaged using pre-assembled robots with defined projects compared with materials and methods traditionally utilized in makerspaces. Additionally, the graphical programming language associated with these robots was more accessible than script-based languages generally used to program Arduinos. This suggests, that to provide equitable access to -- and engagement with -- electronic making, more material and computational scaffolding are required than what is generally provided in conventional makerspaces for implementation in high school classes.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:26Z (GMT).

They were then asked to evaluate these responses against an informational text that conveyed the scientific explanation with Galileo’s thought experiment. Participants’ verbal responses to reasoning about the inappropriate responses to the informational text were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. We found three factors that influenced strategy development: the students 1) kept the conflict between the competing claims of the domain unresolved, 2) doubted the validity of the inference from the thought experiment and 3) mistakenly assessed the plausibility of the competing claims. Implications for explaining the development of reasoning about scientific evidence and for instruction are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To address this issue, we investigated the reading of a multi-representational English text with 32 second language English speakers and its relationship with second language proficiency and learning outcomes. Using eye-tracking, we found that readers could be divided into two groups based on the extent they integrated texts and pictures. The difference in the amount of integration in the two groups could not be explained by English proficiency nor by prior knowledge. The groups also performed differently in the post-test with high integrators performing better, hence demonstrating that text-picture integration is equally important when reading multi-representational texts in the second language.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:27Z (GMT).

The empirical basis is a genetics project involving secondary school students and their teacher. A combination of quantitative methods, in the form of frequency counts of structural features of whole-class conversations, and detailed microanalyses of student–teacher interactions are employed. Findings are that, when the teacher orchestrates whole-class dialogues in which students are positioned as active partners in the conversations, more references to everyday experiences are made. In addition, the analysis shows that the mobilisation of everyday experiences enables the students to reason about complex issues related to genetics as well as enables the teacher to display this complexity and coexisting perspectives. The findings are discussed according to possible implications for instruction and dialogic whole-class activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

New technologies, such as simulated authentic science inquiry, may allow for better assessment of epistemology. Science Classroom Inquiry (SCI) simulations offer real-time, scalable assessment of student practices in authentic science inquiry and by extension their epistemological beliefs about science. Our previous work demonstrated that undergraduate student practices exist on a continuum of sophistication, which may be explained by differences in epistemological beliefs or affective factors like self-efficacy, metacognition, or identity. Our current study examines the relationship between affective factors and inquiry practices. Preliminary analysis suggests that students with expert-like investigations are more likely to identify as a science person. This study raises provocative questions about the intersection between inquiry practices, epistemological beliefs, and affective factors and highlights the potential of simulation-based assessment to examine abstract constructs such as epistemology.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:29Z (GMT).

Video cases, transcripts of independent study, collegial study meetings and of an exit interview were analyzed. Doing the independent study first, the teacher identified problematic student thinking to discuss with colleagues. Collegial discussion subsequently clarified students' thinking and explored next steps in teaching. Affordances of independent and collegial learning contexts, and the role of video, technology, and related supports in fostering teachers' PL are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:30Z (GMT).

Fifty first-year university students participated in the project, using Knowledge Forum (KF) as a digital portfolio to collaboratively reflect on face-to-face activities. Metacognitive prompts were provided through KF’s scaffold function to facilitate reflection, especially on socio-emotional aspects. Our analyses revealed that not all students fully regulated socio-emotional challenges encountered through experiencing collaboration in the environment. Moreover, in the case studies, we found that students who attempted to maintain idea diversity to rise above the ideas of individual group members tended to resolve socio-emotional challenges, while others tried to proceed with tasks through avoiding both consolidating ideas and regulating socio-emotional challenges. These findings imply that in addition to socio-emotional supports, epistemic supports are necessary to facilitate socio-emotional regulation.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:31Z (GMT).

We coded 41 written segments of teachers’ reasoning about their selected next steps to document varied resources that teachers used in making curricular choices. In the vast majority of segments, we found that teachers drew on student ideas and interests as resources for determining next steps.

I describe a specific tactic for teaching mathematics: to avoid using the word “thinking.” This approach is informed by scholarship on race, critical mathematics, and embodied cognition. I argue that using the term “thinking” is not necessary for facilitating authentic learning experiences. Moreover, this tactic disrupts a number of pernicious historical narratives (i.e., stereotypes) about mathematics education and about who can and who cannot do mathematics. The crux of the paper is that avoiding the word “thinking”—and other terms associated with “smartness”—loosens the grip Cartesian epistemology has on mathematics education by shifting classroom discourse away from math-as-thinking to math-as-action, which may, in turn, create stronger opportunities for learning. From a learning-sciences perspective, I present other hypotheses stemming out of this pedagogical approach that warrant further research.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:32Z (GMT).

Throughout this team's design process, co-designers encountered moments of tension that led to increased productivity; however, these tensions also pointed to the ways that participants struggled to navigate multiple roles and goals in agentic ways.

We collected data on 93 students from peer-interviews dealing with the challenges and approaches that they employed during their inquiry process. Using an inductive approach that examined students’ reactions, we identified 247 relevant utterances which we organized and coded. Our first key finding indicates the inter-relation between students’ attitudes, beliefs, understandings, and feelings related to their mindsets. Our second key finding shows that students rely on different strategies of an inquiry cycle when they face challenges and setbacks.

This paper investigated to what extent such problems are caused by inadequate evidence-based reasoning scripts that guide teachers in the way they tackle pedagogical problems. We investigated the scripts of N = 103 beginning and N = 236 advanced pre-service teachers by asking them to analyze fictitious, but realistic problem cases in an open-answer format. Afterwards, they were asked to describe the cognitive activities they engaged in during problem analysis. Results showed that advanced students more often than beginners reported to engage in problem identification, while beginners more often reported to engage in goal-setting. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards research on learning and instruction positively predicted their engagement in these cognitive activities. Thus, it appears that the evidence-based reasoning scripts of both beginning and advanced pre-service teachers might benefit from scaffolding, as well as supportive motivational-affective factors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:34Z (GMT).

In this work-in-progress paper, we describe the development of a library of typical problems that may occur during online collaboration in asynchronous, text-based online settings. The library covers the following aspects of collaboration: communication, joint information processing, coordination, and reciprocal interaction. The library was generated in a process by combining a top-down literature search and a bottom-up identification of typical problems in existing collaboration data. The library will be used as a basis for developing intelligent support for student collaboration in online courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The results revealed that nursing students who learned with the agent-based environment gained significantly higher conceptual knowledge within the key concepts of pharmacology comparing to students who learned via lecture-based curriculum. These findings suggest an advantage with implementing explanatory agent-based models that point out the essential mechanisms underlying pharmacological phenomena in nursing education.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:36Z (GMT).

Therefore, Betz, Flake, Mierwald, and Vanderbeke (2016) developed a theoretical model that captures various aspects of this heterogeneous construct. Our goal in this paper is to undertake first steps towards an empirical investigation of this model based on data from two pilot studies that were conducted in an OSL. In both studies, we investigated whether the intended authenticity level of the method that students used to solve a given task had an impact on students’ perceived authenticity and situational interest. Our studies show mixed findings that are contrary to the assumptions underlying the model of Betz et al. (2016). Hence, suggestions for an advancement of that model as well as implications for future research on authentic learning are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:37Z (GMT).

As a result, the qualitative aspects of comparisons that may be important for the effectiveness of comparisons have been understudied. This paper describes preliminary research on qualitative dimensions of comparisons. Analysis of video-recordings of a math classroom resulted in identification of 244 naturally occurring comparisons that were coded along five dimensions. Two dimensions related to the ambiguity of comparisons and a system for representing such ambiguity are extensively discussed herein. Potential effects of ambiguity of comparisons on learning are outlined.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Using SNA, we explored how two instructors participated in students’ discussions in CBL and traditional online courses to see how instructors adapted support with CBL courses. Instead of differences across pedagogies, we found differences across instructors: one instructor contributed on the periphery of students’ discussions, while another instructor directly contributed to students’ discussions. Based on sociograms and instructors’ feedback, we found that the instructors took different approaches to providing formative feedback (e.g., private communication versus public discussion) intended to scaffold students’ knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:37Z (GMT).

To test the impact of the technology on learning, we compared it to a parallel non-IP environment that approximates locations between two points in classroom settings. Findings indicate that the IP technology enhances engagement with systems thinking concepts through more robust reflection on movements and actions compared to the non-IP environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:38Z (GMT).

Guiding intent participation takes as relevant both the coordinated efforts of oldtimers and relative newcomers to make contributions to ongoing work and learning, as well as the observational activities by the oldtimers that are precursors to guidance.

A systematic review is done to the educational technology research papers that involve the use of phenomenography. A systematic literature search in the 14 SSCI journal websites produced 35 articles. Although there were only few papers which used phenomenography as research approach in educational technology studies, there was a gradual rise in the number of studies using phenomenography across years, with more focus on studying students’ learning experiences, especially in the higher education sector.

In particular, teachers had a more detailed consideration of EF skill development, and reflected on the consequences to children’s learning of how much instructional guidance they provided.  Moreover, we found differences in challenges reported by kindergarten and first grade teachers.

However, certain researchers have proposed the use of multimodal learning analytic techniques as a viable and valuable contribution to more qualitative research methodologies. This paper examines that idea by trying to use the output from an algorithm that learns discriminating features, as the starting point for video observations.  Ultimately, the analysis suggests that there is utility in leaning on machine learning to help identify important patterns in the data, provided that those patterns are contextualized and studied using the original video data. Additionally, the work makes clear the need for better tools for conducting these types of multimodal analyses.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, it is still unclear which specific problem-solving processes prepare learning from the subsequent instruction. To explore the role of problem-solving behaviours during the initial phase of PF, the process data of 24 participants of a quasi-experimental study were analysed. We hypothesised that evaluating their own problem-solving during the initial phase of PF facilitates students’ awareness of their knowledge gaps and, thus, is associated with learning from the subsequent instruction. However, our data analyses did not support this hypothesis. Further explorations showed the importance of students achieving some understanding of the goal state of the problem they solve in the initial phase of PF.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:45Z (GMT).

We observed the knowledge building process of a Grade 5 classroom that studied ecology, conducted in-depth semi-structured interview with nine students to gather detailed accounts of their personal experiences with science inquiry organized based on Knowledge Building pedagogy.  Qualitative analysis of the interviews in relation to the classroom observations elaborates how the students experienced changes in their learning and their socio-emotional and cognitive responses to these changes. The findings show that the students addressed the challenges brought by the changes by exerting a series of cognitive efforts themselves and by gaining support from their knowledge building community.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:46Z (GMT).

However, because models are abstractions of real world phenomena, making connections beyond them may not be straightforward. In this paper, we argue that expansive curricular framing can support productive epistemological framing of modeling, and influence how learners see their model exploration as relevant to their ongoing investigations. We present an analysis of two groups of undergraduate students investigating relative fitness of low and high mutating bacterial strains in a computational model. We demonstrate that even though the groups are comparable in the quality of work within the model, expansive curricular framing impacts students’ epistemological framing of the activity and whether students see ideas from the model as relevant in a broader scope of their investigations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:46Z (GMT).

The paper examines mechanisms through which white researchers, working with a racially diverse team on professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers, instantiated an institutional space of whiteness despite the expressed goal of all of the researchers and designers of the PD to interrupt sociopolitical injustice in mathematics education. The analysis uses empirical examples from a particular conversation about the PD design process that we argue discursively maintains whiteness as the overarching frame of the joint activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:47Z (GMT).

Informed by theories of infrastructuring in participatory design (Le Dantec & DiSalvo, 2013), the collaboration explicitly sought to re-mediate the social relations in the design of school technology practices. Four themes emerged in relation to the ways students sought to construct and refine the design space: Relevance to Student Interests; Opportunities for Responsibility and Growth; Expansion and Refinement of Activity; and Ensuring Use.

We compared three conditions in an experimental study: Students of all conditions first engaged in an identical problem-solving activity. Afterwards students worked on elaboration tasks that introduced correct solutions. In this so-called instruction phase, students worked with 1) only correct solutions, 2) correct and typical erroneous solution attempts, 3) correct and typical erroneous solution attempts with prompts to compare these attempts. Posttest results indicate that only students who were prompted to compare the solution attempts significantly benefited from learning with erroneous solution attempts.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:50Z (GMT).

This international symposium addresses this topic by (1) showcasing and analyzing innovative uses of video technologies in the study of learning, and (2) historically situating such video experiments within traditions of scientific cinema. The term ‘scientific cinema’ is used in media studies to describe all uses of the moving image in scientific study, beginning with the pioneering work of the Lumiére brothers in the 1890s. This symposium presents four contemporary case studies in which video is used innovatively to investigate mathematics learning experiences in three different countries (US, UK, Italy).","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:53Z (GMT).

In doing so, each paper explores the affordances and limitations of Knowledge Analysis to shed light on significant questions in their respective domains of knowledge, including: restorative justice practices, the ethics of drone warfare, undergraduate course design, and urban planning. By further expanding the use of Knowledge Analysis to include non-STEM subjects, we hope to raise important questions and offer richer and more generalizable views of knowledge and learning relevant to both STEM and non-STEM domains.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:54Z (GMT).

We hypothesize that access to recorded archived data along with access to dynamic just-in-time simulations promoted more generative/reflective strategies. Preliminary data on students' written responses reveal stronger written argumentation responses when students engaged in generative/reflective strategies compared to when students used extraneous/non-reflective strategies. Where extraneous/non-reflective strategies occur, we suggest that teachers be made aware of the tendency toward this kind of group decision making and that greater emphasis be placed on optimal evidence use through active modeling.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:55Z (GMT).

Two papers focus on the first question, and furthermore investigate how teachers respond to initial versions of orchestration tools.

This symposium thus convenes to ask, “What is movement in relation to concepts such that we can design for learning?” To stimulate discussion, we highlight an emerging tension across a set of innovative technological designs with respect to the framing question of whether students should discover an activity’s targeted movement forms themselves or that these forms should be cued directly.

Advances in KI have resulted from partnerships that combine expertise in learning, instruction, classroom teaching, assessment, technology, and the disciplines. This structured poster session includes partnerships that have advanced design of instruction, assessment, professional development, learning technologies, and research methodologies. Participants report on new technologies, including games, to strengthen KI; instructional designs that take advantage of collaboration to support KI; and extensions of KI to integrate science with other disciplines. They summarize exciting results and identify promising opportunities for advancing STEM instruction to promote intentional, life-long learners in the digital age.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:57Z (GMT).

It is therefore essential these are of the highest quality to help learners. Ideally, online educational resources would constantly improve based on data and input from each learner, giving a better outcome for the next. This symposium explores issues around the use of crowdsourcing to harness learners’ interactions with resources like online problems and videos in order to improve these resources for the next learner. We hope to explore the benefits and limitations of thinking about learners through the lens of crowdsourcing, to imagine learnersourcing. We will discuss four ways in which researchers have leveraged crowdsourcing to help students learn in a variety of educational contexts, and in doing so we will also discuss ways in which educational theory can guide the future of learnersourcing.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:58Z (GMT).

Is a disciplinary focus a good model for preparing learners for these roles? How well does a disciplinary apprenticeship prepare learners for their everyday lives? This symposium includes theoretical, methodological and design presentations that set the stage for engaging the audience in a conversation over a number of overarching questions that include: What motivates broadening our gaze beyond the disciplines? What methods can help us understand the meaning of a beyond the disciplines perspective? How might subject-matter learning be reconceptualized to adopt a beyond the disciplines approach?

This symposium assembles four papers that offer various ways regarding the measurement of prerequisites and processes of such regulatory efforts during group learning. The presented methods range from Likert-scale self-report questionnaires over video case vignettes towards an analysis of real group processes by aid of logfiles and discourse coding schemes. These methods will be critically discussed, especially in terms of their transferability to studying collaborative learning in diverse educational contexts, both formal and informal. That way, the symposium will significantly expand previous methods for the assessment of self-, co- and shared regulation during collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:00Z (GMT).

We draw on work in 3 classrooms as instrumental cases to illustrate what teachers did to ‘open up’ the curriculum and how these moves re-distributed epistemic agency. In each of the three cases, what teachers opened up had different implications in terms of their reach: the resulting “ripple effect” of the impact of the decisions that students were involved making. These cases illustrate the “disciplined improvisational” work (Sawyer, 2004) required to open up space within the constraints and boundaries of the curriculum to create opportunities for re-distributing epistemic agency.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:00Z (GMT).

Beyond the similarities and differences between these methodologies, this scholarship also imagines new possibilities and orientations drawing on the two traditions – new roles for researchers and collaborators, alternative “argumentative grammars” (Kelly, 2004) underlying these approaches, and even new conceptions of learning itself. This symposium highlights the work of emerging scholars whose research employs variations of CHAT-inspired DBR in collaborative, community-grounded work oriented toward social change.

We heed Dewey’s admonition to look beyond sugar-coating: we do not seek to claim that “play is a good method for supporting traditional mathematics learning,” but rather, to explore the ways that mathematics is engaged through play, and how such different engagement with mathematics might transform students’ relationships with the domain. Taken as a collective, the papers in this symposium address this issue by looking across technical and physical contexts, using different lenses on play, and studying different experiences of play. Despite these contrasts, we jointly ask questions about what mathematics thinking and learning could look like if we changed the rules of the game.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:03Z (GMT).

Individual students are embedded within peer groups, classrooms are constituted by multiple inter-relationships, and school level learning is shaped by complex interactions amongst adults and children. My research has revealed multiple institutional factors strongly associated with student outcomes and those suggest that equity agendas should more intentionally attend to organizational factors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:04Z (GMT).

Virtual internships are learning environments in which participants can develop complex knowledge that make up the epistemic frame of a profession.  The virtual internship designed for preservice teachers considers the components of TPACK as epistemic frame elements.  As a subsequent step, this study also aims to evaluate preservice teachers’ TPACK development using Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA).  Adapted from social network analysis, ENA is an innovative data analysis method that affords investigation of dynamic interaction among frame elements.  In this study, the “dynamic interplay” among TPACK components will be analyzed using ENA. Thus, this study proposes two novel approaches to the challenge of supporting and evaluating preservice teachers’ TPACK development, which is considered essential to teach effectively with technology.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:06Z (GMT).

Two classes were provided prompts for epistemic reflection. The prompts encouraged students to reflect on the epistemic role of the tool for inquiry. The other two classes served as comparison groups, and used the tool without epistemic reflection prompts. Quantitative analysis showed that the classes that received the epistemic reflection prompts outperformed the comparison classes in their learning. We also coded the levels of students’ epistemic reflection and found that it was correlated with students’ science learning from the tool. Qualitative analyses further suggested how students with high and low epistemic reflection scores differed in their inquiry using the tool.

Our ELI-Chem learning environment enables sensory-motor experiences of attractive and repulsive forces at four increasing degrees of embodiment, from mouse interaction to haptic feedback. The theoretical framework is based on embodied learning theory by relating conceptual learning to bodily experience. A DBR-mixed methods research was conducted with 48 students using a pretest-intervention-posttest design. Findings show an increase in students' conceptual understanding in all four conditions, with the highest learning gain in the haptic condition. ELI-Chem provided students the vocabulary, concepts and principles that are required to shift from naïve knowledge to a force-based understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:07Z (GMT).

We investigated whether students' explanations would improve after using the simulation and whether students would take up these gestures in their post-simulation explanations. We found strong evidence that students improved their explanations, and although students frequently used gestures in their post-simulation explanations, they infrequently used the specific gestures prompted by the interface, a divergence from a previous study of another topic.

Results on visual comfort, flow experience, and learning experience in the VR HMD condition are significantly higher than those in 3D projection and the AR condition. We conclude that VR HMD contributes to better viewing experience and learning experience for hands-on VELE in the scenarios tested. Whether the results still hold reliably in more complex learning activities and long-term learning need to be further studied.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:11Z (GMT).

We present a case study of a group of undergraduate students in a ‘hybrid’ computational-experimental biology laboratory course as they investigated a complex biological system. We describe the nature of their progress: (1) mapping their theoretical understanding of the system and (2) planning and implementing their investigation. We then describe the role of the coupled methodologies in supporting their progress by (1) focusing the goals of their investigations, and (2) allowing for comparison and triangulation. Our results suggest that coupled methodological systems have the potential to provide a balance of resistances and footholds needed to support students in learning how to flexibly engage in scientific practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:12Z (GMT).

The study examined the extent to which young students are able to productively participate in creative design and making activities. The results indicated that four of the five student teams successfully engaged in the co-invention processes. The importance of a shared epistemic object of co-design was prominent on every team. Some teams experienced challenges in organizing collaborative processes and the team size appeared to have a significant effect in this regard. The successful teams were able to take on complex and multifaceted epistemic and fabrication-related challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study comprising 122 K12 students aims to investigate the effect of learner expertise (novice vs advanced) and emotional design– face-shape like and warm colors–(with vs without) on developing remembering and understanding. These results showed that (1)in remembering the emotional design group performed better, and (2)in understanding the design benefited the advanced group, but not the novice group. A plausible explanation is the benefits of the emotional design do not overweigh its drawback in the novice group when developing understanding.

We consider two instructional activities that target two qualitatively different representational competencies: explicit sense-making competencies and implicit perceptual fluency. Prior cross-sectional studies showed that students’ prior knowledge determines in which sequence they should receive sense-activities and perceptual-activities. This raises the question: is there a learning progression for sense-making competencies and perceptual fluency? In this paper, we address this question with a longitudinal experiment in which 71 students worked with sense-activities and perceptual-activities integrated in six instructional units of a chemistry undergraduate course. For each unit, students either received sense-activities or perceptual-activities first. We assessed learning gains of chemistry knowledge after each unit.

Our analysis shows that mentors were offered three kinds of support: community building, logistical, and pedagogical. The following kinds of changes and additions were made to the design: expanded project requirements, improved technical infrastructure, and increased opportunities for interaction in discussion forums and live peer chat sessions. We present an analysis of problem sets for quality, diversity of subject area, and usability.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This involves per-ceptual fluency: the ability to automatically see meaning in visuals. To support perceptual fluency, instructional interventions support inductive learning by providing simple tasks that require quick attention to relevant features. Sociocultural research shows that collaboration affords nonverbal communication behaviors that helps students attend to visual features more quickly, which helps them acquire perceptual fluency. In contrast, cognitive research suggests that collaboration is ineffective for learning from simple tasks. Hence, we ask: Can collaboration via nonverbal communication enhance the acquisition of perceptual fluency? We investigated this question by examining how 10 dyads collaborate on simple perceptual tasks via nonverbal communication. We analyzed gestures and interviews about learning experiences. Further, we compared dyads’ performance on perceptual activities to 28 students who worked on the activities individually. Our findings suggest that collaboration helps students acquire perceptual fluency with visuals.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Tasks that involve reading, interpreting and synthesizing multiple sources have been explored particularly in the epistemic cognition literature. Interdisciplinarity is a growing area of interest in education, with commensurate interest in the learning sciences regarding the means by which we induct students into interdisciplinary ways of thinking and working. While interdisciplinary contexts frequently involve connecting multiple sources, from different disciplines, these text-integration tasks have not been well investigated.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:38Z (GMT).

We analyzed two teachers' discourse as they facilitated students' use of virtual and physical models and compared their students' understanding of and engagement with models during a biology unit. We found that one teacher had significantly more talk than the other about the affordances and constraints of models, and his students more purposefully used the affordances of the models to engage in scientific thinking on their own and seemed to learn more about affordances and constraints of scientific models than students in the other teacher’s class. Our findings suggest that the ways in which teachers talk about the affordances and constraints of scientific models is important for students to understand and utilize them as tools for thinking and building knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:39Z (GMT).

Recently, evidence has shown that when people attempt to make sense of controversial issues, their processing of scientific information is biased by their existing ideologies and worldviews. This is considered the culprit of persistent controversy about scientific findings, such as the findings that indicate anthropogenic climate change. Here, we propose an implication to this evidence: To promote science literacy, educators should promote an ""epistemic balancing act"" in the science classroom, avoiding both credulity and hyper-skepticism. Implications for educational policy are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These negotiations are supported, or not, by the teacher’s propensity to engage in the knowledge of children and use teaching to construct shared goals for learning. Implications of the work include new ways educators might define LDs as a complex phenomenon that reflects how children’s knowledge of mathematics advances, or not, through a shared cognition grounded in children’s unique knowing and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:44Z (GMT).

Conversational mismatches, we contend, arise in part from tensions between instructional goals of fostering students’ engagement in authentic scientific sensemaking and guiding them toward particular understandings of pre-determined concepts and models.

Nevertheless, peer feedback may be the main source of formative feedback available in some settings, such as in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A key part of the problem may be that students do not have sufficient incentive to offer their best feedback in settings where supervision is minimal. In this paper, we investigate whether students provide feedback of higher quality when it is done in a public setting rather than in a private setting. We report on an experimental study with 65 participants randomly assigned to a public feedback and a private feedback condition. We report the effect of the manipulation in terms of the quality of feedback offered as measured by a validated coding scheme, the subjective rating of the feedback, the effect on propensity to revise and success at increasing the quality of the writing. Limitations of the study and implications for practice are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:54Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To establish content validity, a group of maker professionals (n=17) completed a card sorting task in which they grouped the 25 vignette-based items based on the maker mindset attribute that they thought each item was intended to measure. Analysis of the results revealed 16 items that were grouped in one of three clusters that largely aligned with the five original constructs after collapsing some constructs. We conclude that the 16 remaining items have content validity.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The Coach was designed to elicit the core learning mechanisms of Invention by problematizing students’ solutions and mimicking naturalistic teacher guidance. This research tests both the efficacy of our designed guidance and the appropriate amount of guidance for Invention activities. In an experimental study, 205 middle schoolers worked with full, minimal, or no guidance versions of the Coach before receiving a lecture on the target knowledge (ratio structures in science). Students who received the full guidance Coach were better able to transfer their knowledge to novel domains.

Findings show that the use of an incomplete seed model as an anchor evoked different responses from the student designers – some extending it immediately, some returning back to it after exploring other design options, and some likely referring to it implicitly. The incomplete seed model provided an example to the students for practicing design thinking and make tradeoffs. The incompleteness also allowed students to pursue different design trajectories.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:07Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

For the scope of this paper, we focus on two coding puzzles where children engage with loops. Our findings reveal that the design affordances of the system are conducive to the learning of loops, and highlight some difficulties that children encounter with loops.

In this study, we investigated how digital learning environments can be leveraged to support collaborative learning through data-driven models of students’ collaborative interactions by matching video and log data. The models successfully detected off-task behavior (43.2% above chance-level accuracy) and task-related talk (34.5% above chance) as students solved problems using a collaborative sketching tool. Future work will investigate how these models can be used to allow instructors to intervene effectively to support collaborative learning through the use of data-driven tools which will provide them with live information about the students’ behaviors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:09Z (GMT).

Practice-based learning activities with a focus on Science, Technology, Art, Math and Engineering (STEAM) are providing new opportunities for teaching these subjects. However, we lack widely accepted ways of assessing and monitoring these practices to inform educators and learners, and enable the provision of effective support. Here, we report the results from a study with 15 teenage students taking part in a 2-day Hack. We present the results from analysis of video data recording collaborative working between groups of students. The analysis of the video data is completed using the ERICAP analytical framework (Luckin et al., 2017) based on ecology of resources and interactive, constructive, active and passive concepts. The results illustrate the differences between students’ engagement with resources which might be utilized as signifiers of student success in similar learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:15Z (GMT).

This knowledge was described by the TPACK (Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge) framework, and it is assumed to be best acquired by teachers’ participation in Learning by Design (LbD) practice. However, little is known about the relationships between LbD, TPACK and technology integration (TI) in the classroom. A survey involving N = 101 US American secondary school mathematics teachers was conducted in a northeastern state to address this research gap and, surprisingly, it revealed non-linear relationships. These suggest that, while TPACK partially mediates the LbD-TI relationship as expected, technological knowledge can have a saturation effect on TI, and both LbD and TPACK can, under certain circumstances, decrease TI. Consequences for further research and teacher professional development practice are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:17Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper, we present a design case as an iterative sequence of evolving conjecture maps. As each conjecture map was tested, we revised it to highlight and refine our articulation of the tools and processes that embodied our design approach. Our design case involves small-town and rural community and school libraries in the United States as partners and DBR sites, with the goal of supporting librarians as they learn to develop and enact new STEM-oriented maker programs for youth. We show how conjecture mapping informed and supported our DBR work and how it helped push for specificity in hypothesized relations between the design, the learning setting, the outcomes, while also forcing a reflection on design constraints.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:17Z (GMT).

To find an answer to this question, which could also be used for optimizing complementarity-based group formations, we have systematically varied learners’ knowledge levels relative to learning partners’ levels (continuous distance) and absolute levels of knowledge (three levels) in 33 visualizations to investigate associated question and explanation intentions. The results confirm a strong influence of distances on intentions, moderated by absolute knowledge levels. In addition, we report from which distance learners decide to ask questions or provide explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The danger is that this approach excludes some students who may not be drawn to coding, leaving them to think that our technological society has no place for them or their unique talents, skills, and passions.  In this paper, we present our work with third and fourth graders to use an instructional design framework to involve children in a design and development project that includes coding but also other non-coding activities. We argue that the instructional design process can be a way of engaging children in our technological society in meaningful ways while still making a place for a wide variety of skills and interests.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:24Z (GMT).

I systematically analyze recordings made over a year of science engagement in one family, showing how science was infused in many aspects of its life. However, whereas this engagement supported the development of a science-person identity for one child, it worked to develop a science-antagonist identity for the other. To explore how positioning and roles may help elucidate such local variation, I zoom in on the moment-by-moment interaction in one illuminating event. The analysis reveals how repeating identification within everyday family interactions can help explain differences in identity development. It suggests considering informal science learning environments also as leading to alienation from science and exploring how equal access to science is denied in subtle ways that go beyond socio-historical categories.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:26Z (GMT).

The emergence of visual, block-based programming environments such as Scratch and Alice have created a new pathway into computing, bringing creativity and playfulness into introductory computing contexts. Building on these successes, national curricular efforts in the United States are starting to incorporate block-based programming into instructional materials alongside, or in place of, conventional text-based programming. To understand if this decision is helping learners from historically underrepresented populations succeed in computing classes, this paper presents an analysis of over 5,000 students answering questions presented in both block-based and text-based modalities. A comparative analysis shows that while all students perform better when questions are presented in the block-based form, female students and students from historically underrepresented minorities saw the largest improvements. This finding suggests the choice of representation can positively affect groups historically marginalized in computing.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While some studies use multiple theories, and attempt to bridge the frameworks, most use a single theory, considering learning from just one perspective. We argue that this can lead to a reduction in what we can understand about learning from each study, and has implications for the quality of designs and limits the possibility of uptake of CSCL tools beyond the specific research context. Drawing on other fields, we identify the potential and need for an ecological framework to inform research and design work, and argue for its importance in the development of the CSCL field.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:35Z (GMT).

Cases were drawn from a larger interview study and further analyzed as compelling examples of connected learning. Important themes that emerged included sponsorship by family, friends, and adult mentors; unique pathways that start with a difficult challenge; and comparisons with formal school experiences. This has implications for how we can design connected learning ecologies that support all learners on unique pathways toward fulfilling futures.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:40Z (GMT).

We find that research on social media in K-12 learning is increasing rapidly, yet largely failing to study impacts on learning. Research is taking place across the globe on a variety of social media platforms, but the majority continues to look at the oldest K-12 learners. Few studies use control groups or comprehensively use analytic data collected by social media platforms. We highlight opportunities for scaling K-12 learning with social media globally and call for educators to engage more with social media developers and owners.

An increased emphasis on learning scientific inquiry practices through the use of models has created demand for model-based curricula that incorporate authentic disciplinary inquiry practices. We argue that the design of GenEvo allows students to engage with disciplinary ideas central to modern biology, as well as complex systems thinking that is crucial in contemporary biological research. We also demonstrate that GenEvo makes advanced disciplinary ideas accessible to students in two very different global research settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:46Z (GMT).

Participants (N=24) were in their first semester of under-graduate teacher preparation. Qualitative data from written-reflections, semi-structured interviews and recorded audio-video observations were collected and compared to an ordinal ranking of groups’ collaborative instruction. Content analysis indicated pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences could be characterized as either a flexible orientation toward collaboration or an inflexible orientation toward collaboration. Discourse analysis indicated that pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences impacted students’ current collaborative efforts and outcomes. Students with a flexible orientation collaborated with higher quality interactions than students with an inflexible orientation. In turn, groups with members having a flexible orientation created and delivered higher quality collaborative instruction than groups with only members having an inflexible orientation.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:52Z (GMT).

Despite the importance of strategic iteration, we lack precise understandings of effective iterative planning and novice challenges, making it difficult to assess formatively and therefore to teach. We conducted design-based research to understand iterative planning and design assessment tools in a full-time 6-week program where undergraduate teams worked on social impact design problems. We found that iterative planning requires a process of risk analysis: detecting risks in the problem space, prioritizing those risks, and setting goals to reduce them. Novices struggled with each step of risk analysis, so they did not plan iterations strategically. We designed assessment tools that surface students’ thinking about risk analysis and support instructors to notice common challenges. We contribute detailed understandings of iterative planning and novice challenges as well as tools that can be adapted to assess real-world problem solving across domains.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:53Z (GMT).

In this study, we utilize the framework of ‘learning as the organization of social futures’ – one that simultaneously foregrounds values and their expressions within learning activity – to understand orientations of informal digital learning organizations. The study focuses on three organizations, all part of a larger research-practice partnership. Utilizing staff interviews and organizational documentation, our findings show that the kinds of social futures valued by informal digital learning organizations varied in (1) how specified versus open-ended these futures were, (2) their focus on access to existing social futures vs creation of alternative social realities in order to allow new possible futures, (3) their relative focus on individual versus collective futures, with each of these dimensions having implications in terms of ways that pedagogies are designed within these organizations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:10Z (GMT).

Data were collected from a random sample of 42 pre-service teachers. Data sources included participants’ lesson plans (N=126) collected through three different time points. These materials were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Preliminary results indicated that pre-service teachers gradually improved their understanding throughout their participation in the course.

This paper examines how adult mentors in a nationally recognized U.S. public library makerspace, who are mentoring racially and socioeconomically diverse teens, conceptualize their practice. We present an analysis of semi-structured interviews with these mentors, which proceded from a broader study that also included participant observation of makerspace activity and focal interviews of participating youth.

In this study, the complicated nature of science practices is framed and traced by drawing on the notion of “science as a mangle of practice.” From this notion, the dialectical relationship between human and non-human agency constitutes science through the dynamic process of resistance and accommodation. Tackling these dialectical agencies may allow us to effectively capture a snapshot of students’ lab activities and science practices. Methodologically, the study demonstrates how the combined use of social network analysis and discourse analysis may provide insight into the complicated nature of this mangled science practice. The study also explores the advantages of using a 360 VR camera, providing an immersive view while reducing blind spots.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:30Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This highlights the need for carefully designed assessments targeting the integration of science and CT to help teachers and researchers gauge students’ proficiency with integrating the disciplines. We describe a principled design process to develop assessment tasks and rubrics that integrate concepts and practices across science, CT, and computational modeling. We conducted a pilot study with 10 high school students who responded to integrative assessment tasks as part of a physics-based computational modeling unit. Our findings indicate that the tasks and rubrics successfully elicit both Physics and CT constructs while distinguishing important aspects of proficiency related to the two disciplines. This work illustrates the promise of using such assessments formatively in integrated STEM and computing learning contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:32Z (GMT).

Forty-five middle school students participated in this study: students in Condition1 (n=22) participated in an AR activity with strong coupling between the narrative and the physical space, while students in Condition2 (n=23) participated in a loose coupling version of the activity. Data collection included baseline data, questionnaires investigating students’ immersion and learning gains, as well as post-activity interviews. Findings showed higher learning gains and increased immersion for the students participating in the strong coupling condition than for the students in the loose coupling condition.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:42Z (GMT).

Hundred undergraduates were randomly assigned to either read a refutation text and then conduct a peer discussion (Ref+Arg), or to read a refutation (RefOnly) or an expository (Control) text, followed by a standard, individual problem solving task. Results showed strong effects for refutation texts on both immediate and delayed post-tests. Contrary to expectations, subsequent peer argumentation did not further improve learning gains. Dyadic dialogue protocols analyses showed that gaining dyads were overall more likely to be symmetrical and to include a discussion of the core principles of natural selection. Several directions for future research are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Building on a view of participation as learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991), we use video-based micro-analysis to make sense of how members participate through contributions to design. We frame learning as a collaborative practice where contributions are used to make arguments with different resources. Across both cases, materials and laminations of space-times (Leander, 2002) are used as: 1) evaluative resources, and 2) knowledge constructing resources for design. In this view of learning, the final product and performance are not only end goals but used as resources in the design process through laminations of imagined future space-times.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:03Z (GMT).

On the affective level this includes students’ experienced motivation both in the instruction phase and the problem-solving phase. This study complements previous research by taking a zoomed-in perspective including multimodal data streams (i.e. audiovisual, self-report, logdata and psycho-physiological data) to fully understand the effects on the teaching and learning mechanisms. Although we did not find statistically significant effects regarding the conceptual understanding, the results of the affective outcome and process variables are consistent with the growing body of evidence that generating solutions to novel problems prior to instruction can improve deeper learning and can make teaching more interactive and student-centered.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:04Z (GMT).

In this paper we argue that by ‘augmenting’ formative tasks with learning analytics, we can achieve impact both through the integration of the tools, and through the support of existing good practices. We exemplify our approach through its application to the design of tasks for the key skill of learning how to write effectively. The development of these designs and their abstractions holds significant potential in bridging research and practice, by supporting the sharing and interrogation of designs in a way that is intimately tied to both practice (practical applied contexts), and research (through theorized and empirically supported designs targeting particular learning outcomes).","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:07Z (GMT).

After clustering wrong answers in the learned vector space, we use these clusters as the basis for analysis of student misconceptions with a quantitative comparison to manual coding and a deeper qualitative discussion based on a constructivist framework.

Through an overview of work conducted on the MOOCeology project it then shows specific ways that such concerns can be meaningfully addressed. The paper concludes by elucidating a set of seven initial principles for “learning sciences aware” EDS/LA work and opening the question of to what extent these principles might be appropriate to guide EDS/LA work more broadly.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:09Z (GMT).

Study 1 introduces the case of a veteran teacher who turned the PDCA cycle twice by finding a problem in his lesson with his colleagues using a dialogue analysis tool and by hitting upon a new plan, which engendered more productive students’ dialogues, which referred to the expected keywords.

Commonly used approaches in MOOCs derive insight into the learning processes from aggregated text or structural data. In contrast, GCA makes use of linguistic cohesion analysis across sequences of learners’ interactions in multi-party communication. GCA calculates six inter- and intra-personal sociocognitive measures of such interactions and from these identify distinct interaction profiles through a cluster analysis. With this method, we were able to diagnostically reveal four robust profiles amongst MOOC learners. This study presents a unique analysis of the sociocognitive processes that comprise the interaction between learners. The scalability of the methodology opens the door for future research efforts directed towards understanding and improving scaled peer-interactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:11Z (GMT).

Broadly speaking, this theme complements (or pushes back against) the notion of purely abstract, “disembodied” cognition and emphasizes the role of physical interaction with the environment in the course of learning and development. A common, if usually implicit, assumption in this work is that learners’ bodies are more or less constant from one era to another: after all, human senses, limbs, physiology, and the basic parameters of cognition are part of an ongoing evolutionary human endowment. This assumption, while historically reasonable, is likely to need reconsideration in the near future, as a variety of “transhumanist” technologies (enhanced senses, bodies, and internalized interfaces with the outside physical environment) become more prevalent in children’s lives. This paper discusses several foundational issues and questions that are poised to emerge, and to challenge our enduring ideas about children and education, in the foreseeable future.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:12Z (GMT).

We draw specifically on Noddings' care theory (1984, 1986), which foregrounds concern for collective well-being and growth. In particular, we explore what a caring orientation can look like in the context of doing science through two paradigmatic cases. These cases highlight how values of receptiveness, responsiveness, and relatedness shape students' social and epistemic practice. These values challenge canonical versions of science practice and invite reflection on the moral underpinnings of learning science.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:27Z (GMT).

Social networking sites (SNS) have been used to extend classroom discussions to such real-world topics. However, their flat-structured layout may not suit argumentation activities. This quasi-experiment in an applied classroom setting investigates the effects of a group awareness tool (GAT) that combines social (group members’ names) and cognitive (discussion points/ stance in initial arguments) information in a network graph to aid communication behavior and integration of multiple perspectives during argumentation on a flat-structured SNS. Students supported by the GAT engaged in discussions with non-friends and students outside their class more than the control group, though the latter integrated multiple perspectives more. The GAT appears to have increased familiarity among non-friends. The potential influence of interpersonal relationships on integration of multiple perspectives is discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The second is from work which looks at how middle school students explain the Earth's seasons. In that work, we attempted to use unsupervised methods to capture elements of what was previously a fully qualitative analysis. Our goal is to provide the reader with a sense for this style of research that brings qualitative analysis and analytic methods into closer contact.

In this paper, I offer a set of pathways that characterize this work towards justice in the learning sciences, work which reflects a variety of means and ends. The pathways are: (1) Consider the goals of an equity-oriented framework for learning; (2) Theoretically, draw on existing critical social theory; (3) Methodologically, focus on collaborative change-making, and; (4) Support heterogeneity in knowing and doing. These pathways are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, but rather provide an assessment of the current justice-oriented landscape in the learning sciences. I then argue that heterogeneity in means and ends towards addressing learning inequities is fruitful for the field and offer some open questions with which the critical learning sciences has yet to fully contend.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:45Z (GMT).

Using a complex systems and embodied approach to students’ conceptions, we conducted a cross-comparison case study of four students’ experiences with the simulation. By comparing students with richer scaffolding interactions to those with weaker scaffolds, we found that directing student attention towards causal elements in the simulation along with requesting them to gesture about the function of those elements helped students develop sophisticated explanations. We describe these cases and reveal ways these scaffolds can and cannot be enacted with the simulation.

All students collaboratively built physical ball-and-stick models of molecules and translated them into wedge-dash drawings. Two experimental conditions received a collaboration script. For the model condition, the script prompted students to focus on the physical ball-and-stick models. For the draw condition, the script prompted students to generate intermediary drawings on paper. Compared to a control condition with unscripted collaboration, the model condition showed higher learning gains and the draw condition showed lower learning gains—especially for students with low spatial skills. Our results yield theoretical and practical implications for collaborative practices with multiple representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We find that the progressions were taken up differently and may have provided central ideas for the curricular units but primarily acted as tools for facilitators to frame discussion around student ideas.

We analyzed students' Scratch projects in terms of elaboration and computational thinking content, and modeled their association with performance on a summative open-ended assessment of computational thinking. Both metrics were associated with performance on the summative task, but engagement had a much more substantial effect. This supports the idea that early computer science experience should be designed to support students in working on personally-meaningful projects. Developing computational literacy practices may be more important for long-term growth in computational thinking than a primary emphasis on content knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:55Z (GMT).

This design-based research study explores how designing professional development (PD) with faded scaffolds and worked examples can further teacher training efforts to bring computing to core content classes.

In order to investigate the kinds of heuristics that may assist in developing such assessments, we present data from parallel phenomenon-based modeling assessments given to 11th grade biology students. While students constructed structurally similar arguments, the amount and how content knowledge was used differed. Students were able to bring in content knowledge more readily when presented decontextualized phenomenon-based models and used this knowledge to make productive connections between evidence and provided models.

As we designed the simulation, we iteratively analyzed the ways that children in a range of low-tech and high-tech conditions engaged in creating a nonverbal system of communication. Findings suggest that the spatial layout of the simulation directly influenced the game’s difficulty levels and subsequently impacted both the nonverbal communication and the learning outcomes of the activity.

In this paper, we investigate the intertwined impact that rapport, self-efficacy, and prior knowledge have on the process and outcomes of peer tutoring. We find that peer tutors in high-rapport dyads offer more help and prompt their tutees to explain their reasoning more than low-rapport dyads, with tutees in such dyads verbalizing their problem-solving process and proposing more steps and answers. Meanwhile, rapport is associated with increased procedural performance, but tutees’ self-efficacy and prior knowledge moderate the effect of rapport on tutees’ conceptual performance.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:04Z (GMT).

We first detail multimodal measures to compare differences and similarities across those groups, and then dive deeper into a qualitative analysis of their exchanges. We then describe how those measures could be used over the entire sample to capture productive interactions in small groups. We conclude by discussing how process data from sensors can augment traditional qualitative observations, and how it can create powerful synergies for better understanding collaborative interactions among learners in settings such as makerspaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:05Z (GMT).

This study focuses on one third-grade unit in which students read and created multiple multimodal texts, in print and digital forms. Focusing on the design and enactment of two focal texts and associated tasks, we ask: (1) How did the design and enactment of the texts and tasks support third-graders' science and literacy learning? (2) How might modifications to the design of the texts and tasks better support student learning? Findings indicate ways in which the design of the texts and tasks, and the teacher's enactment, synergistically supported students' science and literacy learning, but also point to missed opportunities in the design of the curriculum and its enactment, for further supporting the learning of all students.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:06Z (GMT).

Our study is motivated by two observations. First, play has characteristics reminiscent of professional mathematicians’ practice. Second, the child-centeredness of play points to possibilities for equitable mathematics instruction. We conceptualize problem solving in construction play as the process children engage in when they experience trouble accomplishing a goal and work to repair it. To examine this phenomenon, we used head-mounted GoPros to collect 348 point-of-view videos of children as they played in a mathematical playground, where “messing around” with designed objects provided them with opportunities to encounter mathematical concepts. Through a close examination of one case, we illustrate the mathematical generativity of play with the designed objects and argue that children’s construction play can support rich opportunities for children’s mathematical sensemaking.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:07Z (GMT).

This paper focuses mostly on observations of instruction within schools that were assigned to use the new digital resources. Compared to a business-as-usual control group, the structure of classroom activity and teaching practices changed in the treatment group. Observers, who were blind to student achievement outcomes, found two overall patterns in treatment classrooms across five categories of observations. Later quantitative analysis indeed found the ""high"" and ""low"" patterns could account for some of the variance in achievement outcomes within the treatment condition. We explore observed patterns in terms of existing learning science theory and suggest areas where further development of the learning sciences may be needed and how learning sciences can contribute to improvement of digital, blended learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:08Z (GMT).

The results delineate that combining gaze data with actions (reading, writing, scrolling) and unit tasks (main method and JUnit test) gives new insights to further understand the cognitive actions in debagging a program. Moreover, this study also focuses on discovering debugging patterns of successful students in order to improve the design of learning activities to teach students how to debug.

We present a case study analysis (n=26) and demonstrate how teacher moves aligned with our model of instructional improvisation support joint ownership of science knowledge and students having agency within science learning. After demonstrating the effects of these moves, we end with a discussion of how teachers might intentionally use instructional improvisation to support productive interactions in inquiry-based science classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:11Z (GMT).

We extend this work by developing new kinds of practice spaces that do not attempt to fully simulate teaching, but rather offer playful and creative opportunities for novice teachers to develop skills and dispositions valuable for teachers. We summarize six different practice spaces developed through design research, and then articulate a set of design considerations emerging from this work to expand the genre of pedagogies of enactment in teacher professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:12Z (GMT).
