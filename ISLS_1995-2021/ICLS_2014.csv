A crucial and unique component is the use of sequenced texts related to a single over-arching topic, enabling students to use their expanding prior knowledge while reading complex expository texts. BRAVO, consistent with Common Core State Standards, bridges the divide between grade-school narratives and secondary-level textbooks.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:14Z (GMT).

Using a mixed-methods approach, the study employed pre-post surveys, focus group interviews, observations, and an assessment rubric for student projects. The data show measurable increases in students' computer science identities, capabilities, and networks of support, and provide information that was used to strengthen the next phase of the program. High school-aged near-peer teachers also benefited from the program.

We conducted both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of the students' contributions. We found that students modified inconsistencies within a text by changing the text, sometimes even by changing scientific facts. When learners revised inconsistencies between the text and their own attitude they did not change their personal therapeutic health concept, but transformed the text to fit their own perspective. Finally, we found that students rearranged scientific facts to a higher degree if the text was not in line with their attitudes. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A pilot study with four teachers and 435 students revealed how to enhance elements of the design approach to strengthen the learning goals, improve learning experiences with visualizations, and streamline the flow of the curriculum to emphasize productive patterns of inquiry.

Our paper addresses the skepticism and promise that surrounds badges and presents the design principles for motivating learning found among 30 digital badge projects and aligns them with research. In doing so, we consider how contextual factors--such as how badges are used recognize learning and how that learning is assessed--may play out to influence learner motivation in badge-oriented learning ecosystems.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:17Z (GMT).

We then analyze one teacher's use of LP-based data to reason about student thinking and instructional responses. While the teacher reasoned fluidly using LP levels, he more frequently used finer-grained knowledge elements and contextual factors to interpret student thinking; and these finer-grained interpretations led to more actionable instructional implications. Thus, while recognizing LPs as models (imperfect representations) of student thinking, we argue that their assumption of ""levels"" of student understanding may limit their utility for classroom decision-making.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:18Z (GMT).

There are two experimental conditions; prompt and feedback and control. We investigated if there were significant differences on the performance on and use of sub goals among the different experimental conditions. Results indicated significant differences between experimental conditions, such that participants in the prompt and feedback condition had higher sub goal quiz scores, spent more time engaging in each sub goal, had larger page relevant ratios, and had lower irrelevant page ratios, compared to participants in the control condition.

Advances in educational technologies offer new opportunities and experiences for learners, but risk losing the natural forms of pedagogical storytelling afforded by face-to-face teacher-student discussion. In this paper, we present a technology-supported solution to the problem of curating and algorithmically delivering relevant stories to learners in computer- based learning environments. Our approach is to mine public weblogs for textual narratives related to specific activity contexts, both inside and outside the domain of the target skillset. These stories are then linked directly to task representations in the learner model of an intelligent tutoring system, and delivered to learners along with other tutoring guidance. We demonstrate our approach to curating stories by creating collections of narratives that are analogous to tactical tasks of the U.S. Army, and evaluate the difficulty of incorporating these stories into intelligent tutoring systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:19Z (GMT).

This paper argues that examining transfer from the realm of a digital game to the realm of a discipline as a case of analogical reasoning can be productive when trying to understand and later design scaffolds that connect the knowledge representations embedded in games to formal disciplinary knowledge representations used at school. This claim is supported through (1) an analysis of the design of a multiplatform commercial educational game Dragon Box 5+, aimed at teaching children to solve algebraic equations; and (2) tracking the experiences of several players. The transfer from procedures in the game to algebraic procedures is explored as a case of analogical reasoning, specifically addressing central sub-processes such as retrieval, mapping, evaluation of inferences, and the role of prior knowledge in these processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:19Z (GMT).

Professional development resources around educational innovations that are personalized to appeal to the needs and motivations of different types of faculty offer a possible solution. The method of developing ""personas"" to represent key types of users is commonly employed in user-interface design and can be used to produce personalized resources. Personas are fictional named archetypes of users encompassing generalizations of their key characteristics and goals that emerge from interviews. This method is especially powerful because personas succinctly package information into the form of a person, who is easily understood and reasoned about. Herein we describe the creation of a set of personas focusing on the needs and motivations of physics faculty around assessment and teaching. We present the personas, a discussion of how they inform our design and how the method can be used more broadly.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:20Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Seven teachers and 71 students in an upper secondary school participated, along with one researcher. Three lessons were designed and implemented in three different student groups (N=24, 23, 24), with one intervention for each group. The interventions were designed in an iterative process: the result of the first lesson formed the base for the development of the next, and so on. A multi-case analysis was conducted within and between each intervention. The results of the study describe correlations between teachers' deepened theoretical knowledge, changes in lesson design, and impact on students' learning outcomes in a long-term perspective. We found students' learning outcomes increased during the three interventions in three different groups of students (A +0.17, B +0.87 and C +1.54). At the delayed post-test, the learning gain in the third group sustained to be higher than in the previous two groups of students (A -0.08, B +0.26, C +0.75).","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:21Z (GMT).

By mining the usage log files of over 40 teachers who used the CCS over a yearlong period, we analyzed for variability using a framework developed in marketing research to characterize appropriation of technology. This analysis helped reveal different kinds of teachers' patterns along two dimensions: frequency and variability of use. We then turned to qualitative records of teachers' experiences during the year to better understand why those variations appeared. Focusing on the experiences of several teachers, we distilled ""contextual contingencies"" that influenced how they chose to appropriate and use the CCS.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:21Z (GMT).

The dual eye tracking paradigm allows researchers to quantify the degree of gaze overlap over the course of a learning activity, which is often treated as an estimate of the degree of joint attention among peers. In this paper we employ the dual eye tracking paradigm in the context of online collaborative geometry problem solving to quantify the degree of joint attention evidenced in gaze patterns, and explore what qualitative factors facilitate gaze coordination by focusing on the interactional organization of sequences in which gaze recurrence takes place.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:22Z (GMT).

We argue that the positive affect that the student experiences stems from an alignment between his identification as a sense-maker and his epistemological view of this physics course as one that that values sense-making. Conversely, we attribute his frustration to a tension between his identity and his epistemological view of his biology courses as descriptive and fact-driven. We discuss some implications of this model for students engaged in interdisciplinary sense-making more generally. In particular, we suggest that Gavin's frustration with the lack of attention to mechanism in his biology courses might ultimately serve to strengthen his sense of interdisciplinary connectedness and satisfaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:24Z (GMT).

For example, novice designers commonly use trial and error, which researchers liken to backward-reasoning. Experts use forward-reasoning, which allows them to accurately predict the impact of certain decisions. In this paper, we present a complementary conceptualization for how experience affects design approaches. We liken backward-reasoning to example-based reasoning, and forward-reasoning to principle- based reasoning. In study 1 (N=13) students complete an engineering design activity. A qualitative analysis shows clear instances of example- and principle-based reasoning strategies. Study 2 (N=20) compares the efficacy of the two approaches by using a between subject design. We find that principle-based reasoning improves the quality of designs (p &lt; 0.01) and learning of important engineering principles (p &lt; 0.001). This suggests that hands- on learning environments may benefit from encouraging students to employ principle-based reasoning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:24Z (GMT).

(2) To what extent do students' emotional experiences vary as a function of class? Findings indicate that, after taking classroom differences into account, students in Agency classes generally felt more positive about their experiences in science than students in kit- based classes.

It focuses on the design tensions (Tatar, 2007) associated with coordinating the needs of participants from three different tiers of design--involving teachers, researchers, and district administrators--related to the content of designs and to the mechanisms for bringing content to scale within the district. This study argues for the value of a common vision and design methodology to enable design tensions at multiple levels to become generative influences on design.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:26Z (GMT).

This symposium focuses on the approaches of inventing and productive failure. Both approaches delay expository instruction. Students are asked to work on a generation activity with a problem or with contrasting cases. This activity is aimed to foster transfer of the knowledge gained during subsequent expository instruction. The goal of the symposium is to contribute to a better understanding of how the generation activity is best designed to foster transfer. The contributions of this symposium varied the amount and type of generating by varying the materials (e.g., content of cases), the task (e.g., inventing vs. self- explaining), or the setting (collaborative vs. individual) of the generation activity. Mediating processes are also addressed. The symposium will clarify moderating conditions and mediating processes of how generation activities combined with expository instruction deploy their full potential.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:26Z (GMT).

However, we need more understanding of how learning can be constructively linked across facets of children's lives, especially as they move through the world with their families.

The study uses a quasi-experimental design in which four classes of 5th graders in Hong Kong participated in a unit focusing on electricity. The intervention involved students' collective inquiry and, epistemic reflection on what science is about; students used Knowledge Forum to collaboratively work on pursuing ideas; and students reflected on scientific progress with their own knowledge building inquiry. A scheme was developed in assessing students' views of science; and results showed significantly stronger effects for the knowledge-building group compared with the regular inquiry group on epistemic and conceptual learning. Regression analysis showed that students' forum engagement and epistemic views contributed to their posttest conceptual understanding over and above prior science knowledge. Qualitative analysis suggested how students' experience in knowledge building might shape students' understanding about the nature of science and improve their conceptual understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:29Z (GMT).

Across the group, we find different proportional commitments to the work of either filling in the map of how and where digital media practices travel, or documenting the lived practices of the inhabited territories such as homes, community centers, and neighborhood streets. Together we share a commitment that youth media practices need to be understood in terms of both senses of distribution. Bringing these sorts of approaches together is not without challenges, which will be a focus of our symposium presentations. Our synthetic work will be to explore what can be shared, where to locate tensions, and what new questions this new approach may yield.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:30Z (GMT).

We present empirical studies that examine learning in higher education courses in three different countries. These studies focus on student engagement, participation, and experiences in learning activities emphasizing knowledge practices that resemble professional work, and analyze how enrollment takes place and is facilitated by curriculum design and instruction. The findings show the nature and complexity of the knowledge practices embedded in the curriculum and how students become involved in these activities. The symposium delineates challenges for designing learning scenarios that support such enrollment. Ultimately, the symposium contributes to the ongoing discussion on how enrollment and curriculum design can stimulate and support knowledge-driven learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:30Z (GMT).

Both focal pairs of analyses in this symposium make central use of the theoretical construct of coordination class, a theory is associated with KA usually used for analyzing the structure and dynamics of an individual conceptual system. Coordination class theory is used to extend an IA analysis in the first pair of analyses, and is elaborated on using IA methodology in the second pair.

Ethnographic methods served these studies well by providing access to time-dependent processes, by immersing the researchers in their field sites over time, and by allowing seeing from the inside out to privilege the perspectives of research participants.

In this article, we present an analysis of interviews with members of a Toronto-based activist network that fought against the City's proposed budget cuts in 2011 and 2012. We found that the context of activism spawned a wide variety of mathematics problems related to the activists' overarching goals: understanding the City's use of mathematics, creating their own mathematics, storytelling to the public, and behind-the-scenes tactics. We highlight the ways mathematical activity was always ideological, always accomplished through a division of labor within the group, and always strategically selected. We close by considering processes by which activist mathematicians can be better supported by formal and informal education.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:32Z (GMT).

This session seeks to recognize and capitalize on the wealth of complex systems knowledge learned through everyday practices in informal contexts. We present arguments that are grounded in research taking place in four different communities--with Brazilian samba schools, triathletes, Native Americans, and environmental educators. The goal of the symposium is to discuss (1) how complex systems thinking can be developed through different practices in informal environments, and (2) how an under-representation of diverse samples and phenomena may eschew our understanding of complex systems thinking.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:33Z (GMT).

This effort has produced many interesting games though it is unclear if ""educational video games"" have achieved their promise. Similarly, for many years constructionists have engaged children in learning across a variety of contexts, including game design. While these programs have been successful, their exploratory nature leads to concerns about content coverage. In this symposium we discuss the potential of blending these two design traditions. Constructionist video games infuse traditional game structures with constructionist ideals to create gaming experiences that encourage exploration while ensuring engagement with desired content. This symposium presents the constructionist video games construct and showcases empirical research on the use of such games in both formal and informal contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:34Z (GMT).

This structured poster session brings together researchers of teacher responsiveness in mathematics and science to begin hashing out, with each other and with attendees, the reasons for these differences. Do the different notions of responsiveness stem from epistemological differences between mathematics and science? From differences in the knowledge bases about student thinking in science vs. mathematics?

Affect was compared for school vs. non-school, and within school, STEM coursework vs. non-STEM coursework. Within STEM, affect for a focal physics course was compared to affect for all other STEM courses. School was experienced with higher stress, lower intrinsic motivation, and lower self- efficacy than non-school. STEM and non-STEM courses were not experienced differently, but the physics course was experienced with higher stress and lower self-efficacy than other STEM courses. The results suggest that, broadly, university coursework may undermine intrinsic motivation and that the negative impact occurs in the midst of instruction. More tentatively, the process of engaging with challenging STEM content, such as that of the physics course, may tend to increase stress and undermine self-efficacy.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:35Z (GMT).

However, much of the extant research has occurred in math and science classrooms. The four papers in this symposium examine the nature of whole-class discussion in history classrooms, and begin with the premise that teacher facilitation plays a critical role in the quality and direction of whole-class discussion about the past. The first two papers explore the nature of historical understanding, and the discursive and socio-cultural obstacles that often stand in the way of its achievement in secondary history classrooms. The second two papers take a closer look at teacher learning, growth, and reflection in leading whole-class discussion.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Tabak argued that scaffolding can be productively distributed across a learning environment's varied educational resources, proposing a ""synergistic scaffolding"" design pattern: ""different supports that augment each other; they interact and work in concert to guide a single performance of a task or goal"" (Tabak, 2004). This symposium argues that synergistic scaffolding is particularly apt for informal learning environments like museums, where visitors draw on a diverse array of technological, social, and physical resources while learning. Examples spanning collaborative data exploration, multi-context inquiry learning, mixed-reality simulations, and augmented reality exhibits are presented. Each details the educational resources either intentionally designed into the environments or appropriated by visitors as they learn. These examples highlight how designers can enhance informal learning by looking for potential synergies.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Moreover the cases provide insight into how researchers and practitioners can expand their focus on learning to include the connections and possible coordination across educational experiences in various contexts: school, afterschool programs, home, museums, and community spaces. A focus on cross setting learning recognizes all of these places as rich learning environments with their own histories and cultural practices. We are ultimately interested in how people make sense of and draw connections across settings in order to enhance the possibilities for equity oriented and transformative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:37Z (GMT).

Existing epistemic cognition research has tended towards characterizing this fundamental relationship as cognitive or belief-based in nature. This paper builds on recent calls for a shift towards activity-oriented perspectives on epistemic cognition and proposes a new theory of `epistemic commitments'. An additional contribution of this paper comes from an analytic approach to this recast construct of epistemic commitments through the use of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to explore connections between particular modes of epistemic commitment. Illustrative examples are drawn from existing research data on children's epistemic talk when engaged in collaborative information seeking tasks. A brief description of earlier analysis of this data is given alongside a newly conducted ENA to demonstrate the potential for such an approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:41Z (GMT).

Learning-by-teaching is one such strategy. This entails forming students' groups of enquiry, who come to discuss their research findings with the whole class (learning forums), to encourage the building of shared knowledge. This poster uses quasi-experimental method to investigate the change in the performance of teacher-trainees when using learning-by-teaching strategy, after using non-learning-by-teaching strategies. The poster also explores students' perceptions on their use of the pedagogic strategy, in order to illuminate the conditions suitable for successful implementation of method. Three cohorts of students participate in the study over three years. Findings indicate that the strategy succeeds when students' motivation is high, resources are adequate, and timely corrective feedback is provided.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:46Z (GMT).

Objectives This study examined how students used an intentionally designed text set to generate causal models of the carbon cycle prior to and following an instructional intervention. Using a series of rubrics, we analyzed the pre/post models to determine the extent to which students made use of the texts and the quality of the models that they created.

The skills involved in noticing can be challenging to develop in teacher education programs because of the cognitive load involved in attending to the context of the real classroom environment. Teacher education programs can thereby study a precursor to noticing, such as framing. Framing instruction involves developing a range of ""seeing"" events in the classroom. Thus, preservice teachers must frame their teaching experience in ways that privilege student thinking. In our investigation, we characterized the frames preservice teachers employed in their reflection paper. We found that preservice teachers who used frames that were more attentive to student ideas were more capable at analyzing student understanding in written student artifacts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:57Z (GMT).

We argue that tinkering has value as a productive engineering practice and that it can support more systematic approaches.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:02Z (GMT).

Scientific practices, conceptualized as a subset of social practices, are arrangements of comprehensible and comprehensive ways of knowing and doing. The links and separations between the social practices present in learning environments serve to structure the nexus of practices and allow for the tracing of engagement, participation and learning (Bell, et al., 2012b; Dreier, 2009).

Indeed, in the 21st century, one of the important aspects of media literacy became to know how to behave safe online. However, most educational packages on the topic of e-safety have been developed without much theoretical consideration, and they have not been evaluated. Design-based research has been put forth as a good methodology to considerately develop effective educational materials. Therefore, in this study, a design-based research approach was used to develop educational materials about the risks on social network sites. By developing solutions based on existing knowledge and improving these solutions in 5 iterative cycles of implementation, evaluation and revision, this research results not only in effective practical solutions, but also in context-specific design guidelines that can be used by future researchers, practitioners and educational developers.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:13Z (GMT).

Broadly, epistemic cognition encompasses explicit thoughts about the nature of knowledge as well as reasoning processes related to knowledge claims and justifications. Learning scientists are invested in understanding epistemic cognition in a variety of authentic settings, but it is challenging to analyze data in meaningful epistemic categories. Participants in this workshop will briefly discuss varied conceptualizations of epistemic cognition and will focus on how to apply these conceptualizations to empirical research. We will explore empirical methods that extend beyond traditional interview and questionnaire methods to better expose authentic, ongoing epistemic thinking. Presentations and discussions will explore means of revealing epistemic thinking in classrooms and other settings and methods of analyzing data from learners' interactions and discourse.

While ownership is beneficial to promoting science engagement, in this study, we show that conflicts in ownership of science learning manifest and can hinder learning. We document three focal learners who faced tensions and conflicts in their ownership of science learning. Specifically, we examine how learners' development and conceptions of ownership at home and school influenced how ownership of learning was expressed in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry (KC). We argue that learners' expressions of ownership are a reflection of their identity development in science and that conflicts are a part of this manifestation.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:24Z (GMT).

This study traces how two high-performing fifth grade students engaged in scientific modeling across three modeling-centered units over one and a half years. To analyze their epistemologies in practice over time, we examined their model-based explanations and reflective talk about the rationale and purposes of their explanations. While both students developed more mechanistic explanations of phenomena, they did so in different ways. One developed a meta-level rhetorical strategy to explain ""how and why"" phenomena occurred, even in non-prompted contexts. The other used a reductionist analytical strategy to look for deeper level mechanisms of phenomena. These cases provide evidence that students develop EIPs across contexts, and leads to insights about what develops, what might influence this development, and how EIPs can be further supported in classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:24Z (GMT).

Such courses have obvious strengths in their ability to convey (usually lecture-based) content at extremely low cost to widespread, and often underserved, student populations. At the same time, MOOCs, for the time being at least, reflect traditional (and often contested) values in education: the default assumption for a MOOC is that a teacher or professor will present facts or interpretations, record these as video or slide presentations, and convey them to an extensive audience of (usually individual) students. This paper addresses the default assumptions of MOOCs in the light of two decades of research in the learning sciences, focusing on themes of collaborative work, embodied cognition, and both the limitations and opportunities of learning analytics. With these themes in mind, we suggest paths for research and exploration into the next generation of MOOC design.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This TST focused on re- representing user performance in the exhibit, and was designed to help interpreters shape visitor discourse and inquiry. Four cases are presented to illustrate how interpreters orchestrate their collaborative facilitation when a meditational tool is present, and how the epistemological role of TST shifts. We document interpreters successfully using TSTs to coordinate shifts in facilitation based on the state of the interactive exhibit, and using live data representations to connect visitors' personal experiences with exhibit content, demonstrating several potential uses of TSTs as mediational tools for dynamic exhibits.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:25Z (GMT).

Results indicate that Latinas faced many cultural constraints within the landscape of computing, including isolation, marginalization and microaggressions, yet they also described practices and relationships that helped them to persist in their majors. Successful disciplinary performances and access to Latina role models were pivotal in students' adoption of empowered identities. Study participants challenged the notion of computing as a competitive, individualistic enterprise that permeated the local and global computing communities in which they operated. Instead, they developed identities as engaged, community-oriented computer scientists and enacted these identities through their everyday practices in their departments and in the local community.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:26Z (GMT).

Model one, Classic Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, assumes that either complete transfer of skill occurs or no transfer occurs; model two (BKT- PST), an extension of BKT, assumes partial transfer and tests that assumption; and model three, a variant of BKT-PST, assumes no transfer and tests this assumption.

In reform-oriented activities, students first engage in concrete situations, wherein they achieve situated, intermediary learning objectives (SILOs), and only then they rearticulate their solutions formally. We define SILOs as heuristics learners devise to accommodate contingencies in an evolving problem space, e.g., monitoring and repairing manipulable structures so that they model with fidelity a source situation. Students achieve SILOs through problem-solving with media, instructors orient toward SILOs via discursive solicitation, and designers articulate SILOs via analyzing implementation data. We describe the emergence of three SILOs in developing the activity Giant Steps for Algebra. Whereas the notion of SILOs emerged spontaneously as a framework to organize a system of practice, i.e. our collaborative design, it aligns with phenomenological theory of knowledge as instrumented action.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:27Z (GMT).

The study compared four groups, Direct Embodiment, Surrogate Embodiment, Imagined Embodiment, and No Embodiment (control). The findings suggest that learners learn better and have higher motivation when they engage in embodied learning than when they experience no embodiment, and that role-playing as avatars in virtual environments and role-playing physically both enhance learning and motivation more than imagining actions and reading. The findings suggest that role-play can make learning more meaningful.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this case study, we used a communities-of- practice framework to analyze how students' perceptions of the epistemological purposes of several classroom activities change over time. We found that students used their everyday experiences in ways that allowed them to engage in and describe modeling practices that contributed to their classroom's knowledge building goal. In addition, we found that students' articulations of that goal became more epistemologically sophisticated over time.

Since social factors influence learning from this paradigm, understanding which social behaviors a teachable agent should embody is an important first step for designing such an agent. Here, we focus on the impact of causal attributions made by a teachable agent. To obtain data on student perceptions of agent attributions, we conducted a study involving students interacting with a social robot that made attributions to ability and effort, and to the student, itself, or both. We analyzed data from semi-structured interviews to understand how different attributions influence student perceptions, and discuss design opportunities for manipulating these attributions to improve student motivation.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:31Z (GMT).

In characterizing teachers' progress toward greater responsiveness, researchers typically code teachers' attention as shifting toward the intellectual content (substance) of students' ideas and away from other foci such as students' correctness. These schemes, however, do not distinguish between different aspects of the substance of students' ideas. In this paper, we argue that a science teacher, Mr. S, demonstrates progress not by shifting toward greater attention to ""substance,"" but rather by shifting in the facet of student thinking to which he primarily attends and responds. He shifts toward attending to causal stories (mechanistic explanations) and away from causal factors (potentially relevant variables). We argue that such shifts toward more sophisticated epistemic practices should be targets of professional development and of the assessment of responsive teaching.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:31Z (GMT).

In this report, we present an alternate strategy, which we call the General Principle Strategy (GPS). We report on preliminary results of a classroom study where we taught students in two conditions to use CVS or GPS, respectively, in the context of several physics topics. We find evidence that both strategies help students figure out the multivariable relationship underlying the working of a balance scale, as inferred from associations between their performance on a written posttest and on a computer game-based posttest. Based on these results, GPS shows promise as an effective way of teaching multiple variable relations that underlie a wide variety of physics phenomena.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:33Z (GMT).

We build on existing efforts by defining DBR as an iterative process of 6 phases: focus, understand, define, conceive, build, and test, in which other scientific processes are recursively nested. By better articulating the process of DBR, this definition helps us to better craft, improve, communicate, and teach design-based research.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:34Z (GMT).

We illuminate instances of teachers constructing evidence while engaged in a professional development workshop where they are tasked to reconstruct the geological history of a national park. We illustrate four cases, some of which involve the successful construction of evidence and some of which involve embedded challenges with constructing evidence, such as difficulties with background knowledge and individuals ""seeing"" different information in the same phenomena.

As a bottom layer of the framework, the ""pre-coding"" phase makes it possible to translate the raw data into machine-readable and context- independent language, and to make Natural Language Processing tools aware of users' preferences and underpinning mechanisms of identifying the desired pattern. Explorative but promising evidence is reported toward a more comprehensive perspective by combining qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the discourse data.

To investigate this hypothesis, we draw on evidence collected by youth researchers as part of a study of five learning environments that aim to support cross-setting pursuit of interests. Findings from this study support claims that youth do facilitate access to valued learning spaces for their peers, and that friendships can be central to sustaining interest in activities. The data from this youth ethnographic study supports placing a priority on relationships, as well as content, within sites for interest driven learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:36Z (GMT).

However, challenges exist regarding how to describe and measure indicators of this reciprocity. We explored the ways in which 8th and 9th grade students utilized physical dynamic tabletop models towards developing sophisticated understandings of full scale Earth System processes. This approach allowed us to identify and describe evidence of the ""bootstrapping"" that occurs between understanding the model as a scientific representation, and understanding the science concepts of the represented entities, configurations, motions, and emergent phenomena in the real Earth System. We argue that this notion of bootstrapping is a productive means to conceptualize and support the development of students' epistemological understandings of both scientific models and the represented science concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:36Z (GMT).

The contexts in which learning occurs are in fact complex systems with elements or agents at different levels--from neuronal, cognitive, intrapersonal, interpersonal, cultural--in which there are feedback interactions within and across levels of the systems so that collective properties arise (i.e., emerge) from the behaviors of the parts, often with properties that are not exhibited by those parts. We analyze the long running cognitive versus situative learning debate and propose that a complex systems meta-theory of learning (CSMTL) provides a principled way to achieve a theoretical rapprochement. We close by considering other theoretical and methodological implications of the CSMTL for research in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:37Z (GMT).

This analysis focuses on a group activity where children use a mobile app to identify a mystery tree, analyzed through video-based Interaction Analysis. The findings reveal a collective engagement afforded by a coordinated interaction between sensory modes (verbal, gaze, touch, spatial) and mobile technologies (iPads, AR content).

We developed algorithms to score student drawings and designed guidance for each score level. The guidance was intended to promote coherent understanding. We compared computer-generated guidance to teacher guidance in two studies, conducted with over 300 students in secondary classrooms. The studies suggest that automated guidance is as effective as teacher guidance for improving student understanding. Teachers appreciated the assessment of class progress provided by the automated guidance. They reported that it took them several hours to grade their five classes of 30 to 40 students. Thus, automated guidance can reduce the time teachers spend evaluating student work, creating more time for planning lessons, facilitating inquiry, or guiding individual students.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:39Z (GMT).

To this end, we propose a preliminary conceptual framework, called Computer-Enhanced Dialogic-Reflective Discourse, which explains the dimensions of discourse in which students co-explore the challenges arising from their collaborative learning experiences.

The findings point to the strength of this methodological triangulation by further elucidating verbal and non-verbal forms of positioning. Specifically, the results illustrate how the focal student was prevented access to shared learning artifacts and group discussion due to her group members' (likely unintended) `exclusive talk' and `physical blocks'. Whether and how the observed acts of positioning are associated with social categories (i.e., gender) are discussed and implications for the implementation of collaborative learning activities are raised.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:40Z (GMT).

Pushing on Grossman, Smagorinsky, and Valencia's (1999) five levels of appropriation, results indicate that the teachers appropriated tools for different pedagogical reasons, such as appropriating the tools to organize their students' learning, to accommodate their students' learning needs, and to integrate other professional development initiatives.

Building on theoretical works from learning sciences, educational psychology and sociology, shared epistemic agency is conceived as a complex phenomenon that emerges in a dynamic way, and is defined as a capacity that enables groups to carry out collaborative knowledge-based activities that lead to a shared outcome. A comparative analysis of empirical studies of agency shows different ways epistemic agency is expressed in the context of individual and collaborative groups' learning and research communities' knowledge work. This discussion foregrounds the idea that creating intellectual interdependence, which is deemed necessary to co-construct knowledge, is an effort that can be assigned both to individuals and groups, but also to how the structural context affords and facilitates this interdependence.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:42Z (GMT).

Using a sociocultural framework that incorporates activity systems theory (Engestrm, 1987) this research reports on how tensions and contradictions between institutional, instructional, and student perspectives on learning in a one-to-one environment foreclose opportunities for agency and technology literacy development, in spite of access to 21st century learning technologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:43Z (GMT).

First, we developed an empirically-based learning performances framework that integrates relevant science content and modeling practices. This framework a) grounds the iterative adaptation and enhancement of a commonly-used curricular unit and b) lays the foundation for ongoing development of an associated learning progression. Second, we report on findings from analysis of 3rd-grade students' model-based explanations around the water cycle. Results indicate that elementary students generate mechanism-based causal claims and highlight target concepts and modeling practices emphasized in students' model-based explanations for hydrologic cycling.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:44Z (GMT).

Then we describe the theoretical and methodological foundations of social network analysis. Exemplary studies that use social network analysis including studies on legitimate peripheral participation are presented. We conclude that social network analysis can enable us to make inferences about participative learning across specific setting and individual communities. For the future, the challenge is to relate dynamically changing patterns of legitimate peripheral participation to emerging and changing epistemic practices of a community.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:44Z (GMT).

Using a mixed methods approach, quantitative patterns were identified in the distribution and content of student talk at multiple grain-sizes, which were analyzed in conjunction with pivotal sequences of interaction. Findings indicate that despite the existence of participation structures designed to foster equitable collaboration, inequities emerged in both dyads as students positioned themselves and their classmates with identities as more or less competent in computer science. While in the first dyad this positioning was often overt, in the second dyad positioning assumed a more passive form. Further, there is evidence that these positionings had an impact on students' opportunities to learn.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Preliminary analyses indicate a beneficial effect of note-taking on handouts on knowledge about information presented on slides after the additional review phase, which appears to be mediated to a substantial extent by the processing of information presented on slides while watching the lecture.

A content analysis is performed on 5187 journal articles drawing from 12 top journals from 2003 to 2012. This content analysis was semi-automated and guided by an initial theoretical frame. The results reveal that research trends in the Learning Sciences have remained largely consistent except in the area of individual differences and affect, which has increased over the years. Key strengths of Learning Sciences include research on small group learning, inquiry, problem solving, argumentation, and mixed-methods. As the LS reflects on its state of practice, it should recognize that the field has achieved many research distinctives, yet, there are several opportunities for further research growth.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:49Z (GMT).

Second, there is a lack of teacher presence and voice in the national dialogue on education reform and assessment. In this study, teachers led and participated in a professional community focusing on STEM education research. In this community, teachers became increasingly responsible for designing and enacting learning experiences for themselves and their colleagues. We investigated the characteristics of the science teachers' learning process. Findings suggest that teachers who participated in this model generated knowledge and practices about teaching and learning while simultaneously developing identities and practices as education reform advocates and agents of educational change.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:52Z (GMT).

This paper introduces an analytic tool called classroom discourse analyzer (CDA) to address these difficulties, as shown in the analyses of classroom discourse from a fourth grade science class. The analyses demonstrate how CDA can be used by teachers to support their reflection on classroom talk and how it can provide personalized, data-supported evidence to inform teachers' classroom practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:53Z (GMT).

In order to understand how collaborative problem solving discourse shapes the creativity of collaborative products (as measured by the novelty of those products), we analyzed collaborative problem solving talk and the resulting products designed for fictional character by 9 groups of middle- school aged youth.

Such relationships can be described from the perspectives of either item characteristics or student abilities. Existing methods of analyses focus predominantly on the `item-side' of the equation and much less research addresses construct relationships from the `student-side'. In this study, we supplemented a Multidimensional Item Response Modeling approach with a Latent Class Analysis to more fully explore both within and between-construct relationships. We analyzed student written responses (n=317) to 31 ordered-multiple-choice items targeted at five constructs in a genetics learning progression. We present our finding with the goal of comparing and contrasting the types of inferences that can be made with both measurement approaches.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:54Z (GMT).

Analysis of students' written arguments, in the context of an assessment task in genetics, suggests that students use both secondary epistemic criteria, relating to communicative features of models (labels, drawings), as well as primary epistemic criteria, relating to evidence-model fit. Most students used at least one, and often several, provided pieces of evidence to support their arguments.

In this paper, we show how one student responds differently to two similar problems set in physics and calculus problem contexts. We argue that beyond a content knowledge diagnosis, an epistemology diagnosis and an accountability diagnosis can also plausibly contribute to an explanation of why this student approaches these two similar problems differently, presenting additional considerations in fostering interdisciplinary transfer.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:56Z (GMT).

The group with a more successful model and more coherent final explanation judged their own work against scientific norms explicitly throughout their building process, while the less successful group remained focused on social and academic norms as they evaluated their work. When students explicitly invoked particular norms, subsequent arguments tended to coalesce around the explicitly identified norm. Particular strategies for dispute resolution aligned students with either scientific or social academic norms. We suggest the need to make norms and the negotiations around norms visible for students and to encourage science students to use scientific norms when evaluating their work.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:56Z (GMT).

There are ad- vantages to this integration, for both engineering and literacy goals of instruction: The stories provide ""clients,"" to support students' engagement in engineering, and understanding clients' needs involves close attention and interpretation of text. Results are encouraging, but mixed, in part for variation in how students frame the task. For instance, while students often pay close attention to the stories, interpreting and anticipating their fictional clients' needs, they sometimes focus more on the teacher and what they think she would like to see. This variation occurs both within and across groups of students, and it motivates studying the dynamics of student framing. Here we examine two students' stability in framing their work as nascent en- gineers.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Data sources included 30 science lessons focusing on whole-class discussion from three early elementary teachers' classes. Data were analyzed through constant comparative method and enumerative approach. The findings indicated: (1) teachers used multiple roles in establishing argumentative discourse as they persistently implemented an argument-based inquiry approach, (2) as teachers used multiple roles in establishing patterns of questioning, framing classroom interaction, students' higher levels of cognitive thinking was promoted, and (3) as teachers' patterns of questioning changed, the frequency of students' talk increased and the dialogical interaction between students and teachers became more evidence-based and connected.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:57Z (GMT).

In prior work, we found that when providing verbal justifications, learners' speech patterns predict whether their justifications are mathematically sound. However, current views on the embodied nature of cognition suggest that actions and speech may co-constitute reasoning processes. The current study investigated whether the gestures learners use while formulating proofs also predict proof validity. 120 undergraduates provided verbal justifications for two mathematical tasks. We analyzed speech patterns in participants' justifications using text analysis software, and we coded participants' gestures as dynamic or static. Results showed that dynamic gestures were correlated with mathematically valid proofs and with specific patterns of speech. A stepwise logistic regression model found that speech and gesture separately account for unique variance in a model predicting proof validity, indicating that gesture contributes to mathematical reasoning in an abstract task domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:58Z (GMT).

We focus our analysis on two African-American boys, Damian and Jamal, who are best friends and avid gamers.

The goal of the videogame is to give students practice with fractional-whole operations. In addition to logging interactions students made during gameplay, pre and post-tests that capture students' fractional knowledge in a classroom environment are reported and discussed. Results indicate that while story may not seem to be a critical factor in improving learning, its benefits and impact on learning may be more nuanced and complex.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:59Z (GMT).

We define expansive framing as the perspective that learning is connected to other times, places, participants, and topics, and that the role of students is to generate and share knowledge. We examine the degree to which high school biology students aligned themselves with this perspective. Using correlational and discourse analyses of students' performance on transfer assessments in relation to their perceptions of the expansive relevance of their class, we present evidence of a relationship between alignment with expansive framing and transfer. Students who perceived greater temporal relevance across past experiences, current learning, and future opportunities displayed the highest levels of transfer.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:01Z (GMT).

Cognitive researchers rarely consider motivational processes, and interest researchers rarely consider cognitive process. However, it is essential to consider both since achievement and interest are in fact intertwined. In this paper we (1) discuss a theoretical model that intertwines cognitive and interest development, (2) describe how that model informed the development of educational materials, and (3) report on the results of the motivational components of a randomized research study examining the impact of text genre on interest. We hypothesized that students with low levels of interest would receive greater benefit from narrative text formats, whereas students with high levels of science interest would benefit more from expository text formats. The results of this research showed the opposite effect. Students with high levels of interest perceived the narrative texts as more interesting and useful for learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The findings revealed a wide range of sourcing practices. High sourcing participants made more sourcing activities, paid more attention to source characteristics, and made source-source comparisons. Higher levels of sourcing were found to be related to subsequent argument complexity.

Within the store and across multiple hubs in this neighborhood, we found six central processes that facilitated change: building relationships, building community, being family, communicating, belonging, and becoming. Additionally, we found that transformational pathways situated in the social, cultural, educational, economical, political, and research realms drove and connected these hubs, creating momentum towards sustainable change. We use the concept of a rhizome to explore how various hubs were connected through these transformational pathways and how redundancy across hubs created new developmental trajectories for community members. Looking across hubs, we found that transformational processes were generated when multiple and divergent discourses were intentionally allowed to remain in tension, rather than being compelled into consensus (creating what we call spaces of dissensus).","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:05Z (GMT).

The characteristics of emergent communities in an educational setting were not fully congruent with either CoP or CoL and their theoretical principles. This paper delineates the need for an emergent notion and model, termed ""community of learning practice"", which incorporates elements from both CoP and CoL, but simultaneously aims for balance between emergence and design in an educational setting to an extent that allows communities to grow through members' voluntary participation and negotiated community structure.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:06Z (GMT).

Despite having a reputation for being nothing at all, close examination of social silence reveals various kinds of silence, arising under different conditions, playing a variety of roles in the temporal order of social interaction. What distinguishes one silence from another? For instance, why are some moments of silence experienced as uncomfortable and others as unremarkable? Here I introduce a conceptual framework for describing a variety of social silences, built on the work of conversation analysis and an ethnographic study of silence in the religious practices of Quakers. A focus on social silence naturally makes the unspoken dimensions of interaction salient and offers new confirmation for the view that face-to-face learning and communication are always partly constituted by embodied (non-verbal) actions. The included framework, descriptions and empirical data serve as platform for two theses: 1) calibrating to the acoustic environment is a basic way that individual behavior is situated in its social context; 2) group silence regulates collective attention by directing it to the present moment of social interaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:09Z (GMT).

Our reflection on applying PD in the learning sciences suggest a more democratic and effective methods for objectives such as: defining research and learning goals, practices that consider multiple participants in design, practices for establishing participatory living labs for design research, developing infrastructure for sustainable participation, and using PD as a way to seek transferable rather than generalizable outcomes.

We focus on the changes in participation as such changes pertain to scientific practices of argumentation, modeling, and experiential, imaginative, and mechanistic reasoning strategies. Drawing from students' discourse and gestures, conjectures are made about scientific practices being particularly well suited for fostering productive disciplinary engagement for emerging bilingual students.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:10Z (GMT).

In this paper, we examined how the use of contrasting video cases can support participants' learning to identify the ways in which teachers' actions shape students' opportunities to think and reason during their engagement with cognitively complex instructional tasks. Qualitative analysis of two sequential professional development sessions revealed that contrasting video cases supported participants' productive discussions about teacher's pedagogical actions and the ways that these actions shaped how students work on cognitively demanding tasks.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:10Z (GMT).

In contrast to a prior study that found self-explanation was not associated with learning about emergence, students learned significantly more in the self-explaining con- dition. To shed light on how different types of self-explanations are related to learning, we analyze the content of students' explanations and their association to learning outcomes; we also present qualitative analysis of students' misconceptions and how these relate to existing theories of emergent attributes.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:13Z (GMT).

Our multi-level analysis focused on students' learning of specific programming concepts, effects of collaborative and task design on learning, and their personal reflections.

We argue that constructionist gaming approaches promote not only meaningful content and collaboration but also creative and critical skills in the context of coding. We propose that future discussions of serious gaming ought to be inclusive of constructionist approaches to better realize the full potential of gaming as a means to genuinely connect children to technology and to each other and how this potential for more meaningful connectivity can address the persistent access and diversity issues long facing gaming cultures.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:14Z (GMT).

In the case of the Bifocal Modeling activities discussed here, a group of high-school students designed computer models of bacterial growth through reference to a physical experiment they were conducting, and they were able to validate the effectiveness of their model against the results from their experiment. Our findings suggests that as students compare their virtual models with physical experiments, they encounter ""discrepant events"" that contradict their existing conceptions and elicit a disequilibrium.

""Deep hanging"" entails authentic tasks in rich contexts, providing access, capitalizing on opportunity, and building interpersonal relationships. Data include reconstructive history interviews with mentors and video of their interactions with youth in the afterschool program. The conceptual framework for this paper explores the ways that constellations of situated events lead to changes in sociomaterial practices overtime. Findings suggest that surfacing and exploring mentors' self-position with respect to STEM is crucial to understanding how they will position youth.

However, some forms of scaffolding may overload novice-students' cognitive capacity or short-circuit productive exploration of the problem space. Hence, we evaluate the effectiveness of scaffolding in a virtual simulation in physics, considering students' attitudes and prior knowledge. 100 undergraduate students completed either a scaffolded or a relatively unstructured activity, followed by another unstructured activity. While the given scaffolding was beneficial for students with high prior knowledge, it did not assist students with low prior knowledge. Furthermore, the scaffolded activity increased students' attitudes towards memory-and-recall in a way that transferred to the later unsupported activity, where these goals were no longer appropriate. Last, prior knowledge did not contribute to learning outcomes in the presence of intuitive grounded feedback. We explain these results in terms of productive failure and cognitive load.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We propose a theoretical construct, metaphorically termed the internal metric for certainty in explanation, to account for the process of internal evaluation. We suggest that the internal metric is multidimensional, and discuss three dimensions: (1) intuition; (2) local coherence; (3) mechanistic reasoning. We argue that these three dimensions are highly active in self-evaluating explanations about phenomena in the physical world. We operationalize these dimensions into empirically traceable terms. We illustrate our framework through an analysis of an episode of a student's reasoning about what causes a plastic bottle to shrink when air is pumped out of it. The analysis demonstrates that the framework can explain conviction in an explanation, as well the preference for one explanation over another.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:17Z (GMT).

How might technology support these exchanges? And how might documenting these exchanges inform teachers' and researchers' improvements to their instruction and design? We describe the Public Idea Manager, a new curriculum-integrated tool that supports students exchanging ideas during web-based science inquiry. Our exploratory analyses show relationships between the diversity and sources of students' ideas and the quality of their explanations.

Partially but not entirely explained by socioeconomic factors, REM underperformance is associated with different and inequitable sociocultural demands between informal and formal settings where REM children learn and develop. ""Culturally responsive"" classroom teaching is posited to help remedy this situation, but conceptual clarity and empirical support are limited. To address these limitations I recommend the learning sciences closely study cultural dimensions of social interactions across diverse classroom settings. Derived from a synthesis of research and theoretical traditions, I present an emergent framework of sociocultural interactions in classroom settings--10 dimensions organized into three domains: Life Applications, Self in Group, and Agency. I describe the constructs and address implications for design research: the need for reliable observation, and stronger theories of classroom settings/contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:18Z (GMT).

Taking a Cultural- Historical Activity Theory with Institutional Theory framework (CHAT-IT), a discursive analysis of ILT meetings displays the seeming resolution of manifestations of cultural- historical contradictions within the ILT's enactment of the IR practice. Yet, further analysis of and interviews with individual members troubles these resolutions, particularly when seeing IR as a coercive, mimetic, and normative mechanism. As one of few studies adopting the CHAT-IT framework, this case study supports the fruitful, dialogical understanding of organizational learning as culturally and historically situated activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:18Z (GMT).

We identify a history of ideas inside and outside the learning sciences that inform this objective, including the political dimensions of the field's founding theorists. We then offer examples of ways these tensions manifest in our own empirical work, and conclude by considering how explicit attention to political dimensions of learning can advance our theories about what learning is, about what it is for, and about the conditions that give rise to deep forms of learning for all.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:19Z (GMT).

Often, discussions of connected learning focus on children and youth with an emphasis on informal, out-of-school settings. We argue college students and adults may benefit just as much from connected learning, and formal settings of learning should not be neglected in conversations of connected learning. We describe and analyze a new university course called Craft Technologies, developed to engage non-engineering, non-computer science major students by creating projects that would change the way they thought of and used computers and electronics.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:20Z (GMT).

Data from interviews, surveys, and tests reveal that visitors' knowledge significantly increased after engagement with multiple visualizations. Both children and adults attributed their understanding to the affordance of multiple visualizations to accommodate a range of learning styles and to offer a diverse range of types and depth of knowledge. Based on these findings, we suggest that designing for multiple visualizations in museum exhibits is a positive approach to increasing visitors' understanding of scientific knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:21Z (GMT).

Students from six 3rd-grade classrooms generated models of the water cycle during an 8-week water unit. Findings suggest that students in the scaffolded group (n = 120) more frequently represented sequences of water underground than the unscaffolded group (n = 112). However qualitative results indicate the scaffolded group was also less likely to generate model-based explanations from their sequences of `hidden' water processes. We conclude that embedded curricular scaffolds may support students to consider `hidden' components but, alone, may be insufficient for theory building.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:21Z (GMT).

Each student in a group read a different document related to learning environment principles (expert group work). Then, students worked together to integrate the ideas in the documents through discussion (jigsaw group work). We examined the proposed design by analyzing the types of regulation that students used and by interpreting their means of solving social conflicts. Furthermore, the relationship between group characteristics and learning outcomes was explored. Results show that stable engagement in socially shared regulation of learning in the jigsaw group was related to better learning outcomes. In addition, students failed to maintain their socially shared regulation when members had different regulation strategies for solving their social conflicts in groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:25Z (GMT).

In this paper, we consider how the ICAP framework can be used in the evaluative stages of the instructional design cycle to assess learning tasks and implementation. Using an example lesson from a language arts classroom, we describe the evaluation methodology, consider how analyses revealed potential disconnects between intention and implementation, and discuss how ICAP- based evaluations may advance the design cycle by informing future lesson plans.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:25Z (GMT).

In doing so, they need to engage in sense-making processes to build up conceptual understanding of the connections, and in fluency-building processes to fast and effortlessly use perceptual properties to make connections. We investigate how these learning processes interact, and consequently, which learning process should be supported first. We contrast two hypotheses: (1) conceptual understanding facilitates fluency-building processes, and (2) fluency enhances sense-making processes. We conducted an experiment to investigate whether students learn better if they receive sense- making before fluency-building support, or fluency-building before sense-making support. We assessed students' learning outcomes, problem-solving behaviors, conceptual reasoning, and visual attention. Our results show an advantage for supporting sense-making processes before fluency-building processes rather than vice versa. We conclude that instructional materials with multiple representations should first support sense-making processes and then support fluency-building processes in connection making.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:26Z (GMT).

As such, new educational models have called for learning environments that improve spatial ability. These environments neglect the role of representational competence in supporting spatial thinking in individual STEM fields. This short paper reports a preliminary investigation concerning the unique contribution of representational competence to spatial thinking in the discipline of organic chemistry. Using authentic disciplinary tasks we show that student achievement and response time depends more upon their developing representational competence in chemistry than mental rotation ability and that the format of a disciplinary representation can significantly mediate spatial thinking. Given these findings we argue that new learning environments that target representational competence may be more effective at supporting spatial thinking than those that attempt to train generic spatial ability.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:27Z (GMT).
