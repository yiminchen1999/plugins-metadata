However, very little is known about the actual, everyday use of ubiquitous social network technologies for learning and study purposes in secondary schools. In the present work, we present findings from two survey studies on representative samples of Israeli, Hebrew-speaking teenagers (N = 206 and N = 515) which explored the scope, characteristics and reasons behind such activities. Findings show that such practices can be described best as online knowledge sharing, that is: the up- and downloading of knowledge and knowledge sources to social network peer groups. This teenage, school-related knowledge sharing is common and widespread, entails different types of knowledge, and is mainly motivated by prosocial motives, as well as expectations for future reciprocation. Sharing is predicted by individual differences, such as gender, collectivist values, mastery goal orientations and academic self-efficacy. Relations between competitive-individualist values and sharing are more complex, and are, among others, moderated by expectations for future benefits. Implications for educational practices and for collaborative learning theories are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The eye-tracking activities helped make visible and public students' private visual strategies. Utilizing these data and other multi-modal representations, students participated in a collaborative, metacognitive, reflective process regarding their own visual strategies, the mental processes of others, and comparisons within. This activity was one of an ensemble of technological activities and artifacts that afforded students a way to collaboratively engage with otherwise private, and often tacit thoughts.

Students investigated Netlogo (Wilensky, 1999) models that included features relevant to their chosen topic. After exploring one of the computer models, students met in jigsaw groups (Aronson & Patnoe, 2011). Results on assessment items matched to each investigation show that scores improved across all topics for all students.

In this study, we define participation evenness plus the dimension of the quality of students’ notes as “idea evenness”. Adopting the entropy and using the depth of understanding within students’ theorizing notes as the parameter, we analyzed the idea evenness of five Knowledge Building communities. We found that the idea evenness values are high in four of the communities and can reflect the different distributions of students’ depth of understanding in different communities.

Two researchers collaborated with a group of high school students with a shared goal of designing school technology practices that were meaningful to the students. Informed by theories of infrastructuring forms of participatory design (Le Dantec & DiSalvo, 2013), the collaboration explicitly sought to re-mediate the social relations of designing the school’s organizational practices with technology. This study analyzes the development and implementation of a student-designed school technology practice as a case study to examine how infrastructuring forms of participatory design mediated shifts in power relations and organizational practices at the school site. Results indicate that forms of participatory design which seeks to address social relations in the process and outcomes of design can contribute to shifts in student roles within the school and facilitate boundary crossing (Akkerman & Bakker, 2011) in which student goals were reflected in new organizational technology practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:47Z (GMT).

High and low performing teams were identified based on number of social challenges experienced by the team. Challenges and goals were measured using a modified version of AIRE (Järvenoja, Volet, & Järvelä, 2013). Using a mixed methods exploratory approach, preliminary results showed that teams whose members (a) interacted with more positive social-emotional interactions (b) reported more team-oriented goals, and (c) had prior familiarity with each other, reached higher levels of mutual trust and shared mental models. Specifically, findings highlight the role of socio-emotional interactions in enhancing mutual trust and shared mental models, and have implications for teams composed of learners with heterogeneous expertise in CSCL environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:49Z (GMT).

The two approaches are scripted collaboration and Knowledge Building. Rather than focusing on similarities and differences, the symposium will address deeper problems such as reconciling external supports of all kinds with the self-organizing character of knowledge construction and integrating such supports into classrooms viewed as knowledge-creating communities. The centerpiece of the symposium is a panel discussion that includes experts who provide different theoretical viewpoints. In its synthesis the symposium will capture and make sense of what is strongest in the two approaches and provide a broad conceptual basis for next-generation initiatives.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:54Z (GMT).

A repeated measures survey was conducted at the end of high school and results compared from the end of middle school to the end of high school. For girls who had developed an interest in a computing career by the end of middle school, interest in computing increased. Aspirational expressions of interest, defined as stating an interest in computing, were highly correlated while embodied expressions of interest, defined as engaging in computing activities such as classes, clubs, or hobbies were generally not correlated. Participants appeared more definite in their attitudes towards computing by the end of high school, particularly interest in computing as a career and college major, than they had at the end of middle school.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:56Z (GMT).

First, they can provide collaboration scripts that adaptively react to student actions and prompt them to engage in effective collaborative behaviors. Second, collaboration often involves multiple visual representations. But many students have difficulties in making sense of representations. Educational technologies can support students in doing so by adapting to how they construct, interpret, and connect representations. We conducted a quasi-experiment with 61 undergraduate chemistry students to test the effectiveness of an adaptive collaboration script that prompts students to discuss visual representations. A control condition collaboratively solved worksheet problems with multiple visual representations without a collaboration script. An experimental condition solved the same problems using an educational technology with the script. The experimental condition showed significantly higher learning gains on a transfer posttest and on complex questions on a midterm exam three weeks later.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:57Z (GMT).

Many innovative approaches to classroom design come with the intention that practices of the people who are experts in a domain are enculturated by classroom students. This idea, known as authenticity, has been carefully conceptualized in a large variation of educational settings. Cognizant of the inherent gap between conceptualizations and their implementation, we used a constant-comparative method to analyze different variations of authentic learning designs. With the aim of bridging this research-practice gap, our analysis resulted in a model of cultural interaction within learning environments based on different configurations of participants and settings. The conceptual contribution of our research is a refined framework of authenticity that foregrounds the role of human interaction in cultural mediation. Practically, our model contributes new insights into the design of authentic learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The study was conducted with 382 4th and 5th grade students. Students across all three conditions had significant learning gains. However, the combined condition had higher learning gains than the individual or collaborative condition. This difference was more pronounced for 4th grade students than for 5th grade students. In addition, we found that students in the combined condition expressed higher situational interest in the activity compared to those working individually and the same as students working only collaboratively. Through a combination, we may support better student learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study demonstrates how an anchored annotation system was used in a first semester online, asynchronous doctoral course to support more effective reading-centered knowledge construction. We investigated the discussion activities of 12 online doctoral students as they explored seven articles during two non-consecutive weeks.  Through analysis of 591 student comments and replies, we examined how students used the anchoring system as a support to help make sense of the articles. We found that using anchored annotation reduced coordination activities and supported knowledge construction, particularly interpretation and elaboration of ideas.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:00Z (GMT).

Concerning communication behavior, we found no effect of content-related information, but a main effect of partner information indicating that the visualization of a learning partner’s knowledge deficit implicitly guides learners to give longer explanations.

Phenomenological analyses of students’ uncertainty attributions (N = 840) identified five distinct patterns: self-introspection, personal theories and experiences, data source acknowledgement, scientific description based on singular causal accounts and frequency of observations, and deep uncertainty based on epistemic or ontic accounts. Discourse captured on video illustrated how intelligent feedback enhanced uncertainty attribution.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

As opposed to traditional pen and paper tests, we designed a series of hands-on task that participants complete before and after a maker workshop. In this paper, we contrast high-school students’ performance with experts (graduate students in mechanical engineering) and found evidence that the students’ behavior became more similar to experts’ after participating in a maker workshop. For the scope of this paper, we focus on a single task and describe in detail our coding scheme and analyses. Additionally, we show how a combination of qualitative and computational analysis helped us develop metrics to compare novices’ and experts’ performances. We conclude by discussing the potential of this type of assessment for supporting students’ learning in makerspaces. \","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this dual eye-tracking study, with 36 participants, a two-staged within-group experiment was conducted to investigate students’ collaboration and learning gains in an interactive display. The results show that collaboratively, pairs who have high gaze similarity have high learning outcomes.

Individual measures revealed learning gains on content tests and documentation of shared ideas during collaboration. Group measures revealed increased conceptual discourse over time and streamlining of the research process. Measures at each level indicated distinct paths of inquiry for students and groups; however, these differences were not associated with negative conceptual outcomes.

In this study, we hypothesized that a curricular model based on scientific practices and agent-based simulations to teach biology through a complex systems lens would support students’ coherent understanding of biology. We investigated the extent to which and ways our curriculum supported students’ biology coherence. Units covered topics of diffusion, ecology, enzymes, evolution, genetics, and modeling.

In a study of undergraduate novice computer science students working in pairs, we observed that the students who produced the lowest quality solutions expressed uncertainty more often than those who produced middle-quality solutions. Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously. These findings provide insight into how best to support collaborative learning during uncertainty.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We investigated (1) whether the combination of these frameworks can be fruitfully applied to model scientific reasoning processes and (2) what unit of analysis researchers or instructors should choose to answer questions of interest. One novel aspect of our study is that we compared epistemic networks in case of collaborative vs individual reasoning processes.

A corpus of 55 conversations in which participants used explicit links between utterances where they considered necessary for clarity was used for validation. Our study represents an in-depth analysis of multiple methods used to identify implicit links and reveals the accuracy of each technique in terms of capturing the explicit references made by users. Statistical similarity measures ensured the best overall identification accuracy when using Mihalcea’s formula, while WordNet-based techniques provided best results for un-normalized similarity scores applied on a window of 5 utterances and a time frame of 1 minute.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:10Z (GMT).

The overall aim was to understand how to integrate community-driven science and urban development in school education, in addition to identifying the knowledge and practices that emerged from the process. Our study presents survey data from two 7th grade classes (50 students 13–14 years of age) that developed Minecraft and LEGO models that re-designed their neighbourhood to solve local problems. The results show that, over the course of the project, students became aware of the authentic knowledge they possess about their urban area and that they are able to connect it to structural changes.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:15Z (GMT).

Research suggests that these features may enhance learning by providing formative feedback. To understand how technology and collaboration support learning by providing formative feedback, we conducted an observational study in a traditional and an active learning version of an undergraduate chemistry course. Results suggest that technology-provided feedback in the active learning intervention enhanced collaboration. We identify specific challenges and opportunities in technology design and active learning interventions for computer-supported collaborative learning research to address.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:16Z (GMT).

For the CSCL research community, the adoption of SNA techniques as part of the methodological repertoire requires adequate understanding of the core concepts, their potential contributions, and limitations. We started from the hypotheses that (1) most applications of SNA in CSCL research make use of a small set of basic methods; and (2) the discourse related to SNA is partly inadequate or imprecise. To further analyze and corroborate these “issue hypotheses” we have used network analysis techniques in order to reveal relations between SNA measures and specific aspects of CSCL research (activities, contexts, research methods) based on a corpus of 90 published studies.

The results from 190 students from an introductory programming class working in 95 pair-programming teams demonstrate that this simple modification to pair programming had a significant positive effect on test scores and on substantive contributions in collaborative dialogue.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:17Z (GMT).

These data and multi-camera videos were used by humans to code episodes as collaborative vs. various kinds of non-collaboration.  Using just the speech and tablet log data, several detectors were machine learned. The best had an overall accuracy of 96% (Kappa=0.92), which is higher than earlier attempts to use speech and log data for detecting collaboration.

We examined how different graphing activities during science inquiry helped to develop these interrelated abilities in students. Grade 7 students (N=117) worked in pairs on a web-based cell biology unit to either generate or critique graphs of the effects of proposed cancer treatments on cell numbers. All students gained in their graph and science explanation abilities. While students who critiqued graphs gave better overall explanations within the unit, students who constructed graphs better applied their conceptual understanding of science to explain their graphs, both within the unit and later on the post test. We interpret these findings in terms of the relative affordances and constraints of critique and construction activities, and observe students’ common misunderstandings of graphs. This study has implications for designing instruction that supports students’ uses of graphs within science contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In peer tutoring, for instance, tutors may avoid providing feedback to their partners to avoid the face-threat to their tutee. In this paper, we explore how the interpersonal closeness between tutor and tutee impacts tutors’ use of indirectness with feedback and instructions, and the impact those moves have on tutees’ problem-solving. We found that stranger tutors use more indirect instructions and provide more positive feedback to their tutee than friend tutors, and that stranger tutees attempted and solved more problems when their tutors used indirect instructions. We found no effect for dyads of friends, suggesting that interpersonal closeness reduces the face-threat of direct instructions. These results demonstrate that designers of CSCL tools should incorporate awareness of students’ relationships into their systems, as that relationship impacts students’ collaborative learning behaviors.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:25Z (GMT).

Two pairs of students were purposefully selected from a cohort of eighteen 11th graders, due to their diametrically opposing views about their immersive experience. The analysis of students’ discourse during the activity, and of post-activity interviews, yielded a coherent indicator of immersion. To investigate whether each pair’s immersion affected the learning process, we analyzed activity logs, discourse and learning outcome of the two pairs during the collaborative learning process.

GroupWork was used to facilitate real-time group-based formative assessment and other problem-based activities in the classroom. Specifically, we examine the short-term and long-term impact of this implementation on students’ learning outcomes and experiences compared to performing formative assessments where students work individually. Results show significant performance improvement for each student and for each assessment question when students are allowed to discuss their solutions with peers. The formative assessment grades after collaborative problem solving are shown to have a strong correlation with final course grades, suggesting that collaborative problem solving may have a lasting benefit.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:35Z (GMT).

When the exhibit elements being tested are intended to support open-ended group exploration and dialogue, existing knowledge-based metrics like measuring the amount of content recalled don’t quite apply. Visitor groups can explore the educational content in idiosyncratic ways, meaning that not all groups have the same exposure to content, and the learning arises from the visitors’ conversations. In order to evaluate learning outcomes for CSCL exhibits, we present a method for quantifying idiosyncratic social learning, Scoring Qualitative Informal Learning Dialogue (SQuILD), and demonstrate how it was applied to A/B testing of a collaborative data visualization exhibit in a metropolitan museum.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:37Z (GMT).

Prior to collaboration, students watched one of three instructional videos modeling either domain knowledge, collaborate reasoning, or both. There was no impact of video type on student talk behaviors, nor posttest scores. However, we found a correlation between high rapport states and strong reasoning states, as well as a marginal effect of more co-constructive reasoning leading to improved posttest scores. This work demonstrates that students’ rapport states may play a role in students’ reasoning states, and thus calls for a deeper investigation within the CSCL community about the role of rapport in peer learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:40Z (GMT).

In a field study at two multi-disciplinary scientific events (Alpine Rendez-Vous 2011 and 2013) including N=287 researchers, we investigated selection patterns, looking specifically at career level and disciplinary background, and included a cognitive group awareness intervention. While we could not completely explain how researchers choose with whom they interact, we found that transitivity and interaction duration are relevant for later collaboration. Cognitive group awareness support was beneficial for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Career level was a less relevant factor.

If the effect of script based support is mainly by means of its effect on collaborative processes, it would be reasonable to expect that if two forms of support manipulate the same process variable, they would provide redundant rather than synergistic effects when offered together. However, explicit forms of scaffolding may provide additional benefits from the reification of the processes that they provide, which could be received as instruction. This paper contributes to research on dynamic support for collaborative learning by proposing a novel form of micro-level prompt designed to elevate the amount of Transactive exchange. In a 2×2 factorial design, we measure the impact of this explicit form of scaffolding and an implicit form of support for Transactive exchange developed in prior work, alone and in combination in terms of impact on two key outcomes, namely collaborative product quality and acquisition of multi-perspective knowledge. In this study, the pair of manipulations provide synergistic support for group product quality, but only the explicit support contributes to acquisition of multi-perspective knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:42Z (GMT).

This current study, by coding emergent leadership and relational thinking from two sets of small group discussions (25 in total), revealed that over time, children exhibited more leadership and relational thinking in the second collaborative discussion than their first one. In addition, intellectual leadership moves, rather than organizational leadership moves, were positively related to generation of relational thinking.

However, the collaborative and cooperative character of making poses a tension to traditional portfolio assessment that is focused on showcasing individual achievements. Together, this calls for an expanded understanding of the use of portfolios in maker education. We examined the types of portfolio entries at two youth-serving makerspaces (one out-of-school and one in-school), and observed the documentation of personal and shared projects in personal and shared portfolios. Our main findings are that, compared to portfolios that focused on personal work alone, portfolios that included shared projects and documentation presented richer showcases, showing technical and social engagement, assessment by people across a distributed community, and possibilities to narrate work to multiple audiences. This has implications on the facilitation of maker portfolios and broadens portfolio assessment to show the role of the learner in society.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:47Z (GMT).

We assigned real, de-identified grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to four panels of experienced NIH reviewers, one of which met via videoconference. The videoconference panel was slightly more efficient than the face- to-face panels, but the outcomes of their decision making (i.e., the scores assigned to grant applications) did not differ. However, preliminary analyses suggest there are differences in the nature of the collaborative discussion among reviewers between the two meeting formats. We discuss implications for research into technology-mediated collaborative decision making, as well as for the scientific grant peer review process broadly.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:48Z (GMT).

This approach identifies points of contact between pre-existing practices and collaborative structures and pedagogical considerations. This enables designers to infuse pedagogical innovations into the activities that local participants already value and perform, achieving benefits akin to participatory design approaches. This can be productive for building on local practices that may be difficult to elicit through design discussions, especially if these local practices are part of learners’ counterculture.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:49Z (GMT).

Starting from an initial set of 823 papers, identified in major databases, each paper was coded by multiple researchers to identify demographics (sample sizes, countries, work domains), methods (data sources, technology design) and outcomes (analysis, forms of collaboration). Finally, only 26 papers met our selection criteria, which illustrates that CSCL research is dominated by K-12 and higher education contexts, while vocational learning contexts are under-represented in this field of study. This observation spurs the question if there is anything unique in VET worthy of being investigated through a CSCL framework. Our analysis hints at a positive answer to this question, both for technological and collaborative components.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

By analysing how students and teachers move and interact in relation to each other, the space they are in and the objects within it, we can gain a greater understanding of the physical nature of collaborative group-work. This understanding can help us to create a learning environment that intrinsically but unobtrusively supports access by all user profiles who seek to engage with it, thus promoting equity of engagement and participation. Using the example of the design of a Learning Analytics System (LAS) and the educational furniture in which it is implemented, we will show how the physical design of a CSCL implementation can support increased collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:52Z (GMT).

We analyzed the reflections of 23 students, who worked in pairs over a series of fifteen 90-minute workshop sessions, about their experiences collaborating and communicating across the different domains of e-textiles creation (e.g., design, circuitry, coding, and crafting). Student perceptions highlighted potential causes of these interactions across these multiple domains, which are distinct from pair programming activities. In the discussion, we address how these perceptions inform the design and development of more equitable pair e-crafting arrangements.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:55Z (GMT).

As a vehicle of perspective-taking, the tangible puppetry CSCL can create a learning environment that reduces the participants' anxiety or apprehension toward evaluation, drawing out various types of pupils or students, so that they can learn various perspectives. A classroom study revealed that the effect of tangible puppetry role-play remained in the immediate transfer task; the participants could elicit a variety of voices from possible pupils even in the self-performed role-play, and they did not lose such perspective immediately on their essay. However, the mutual feedback discussions in the third session changed significantly, as similar to the first trial. This paper discusses necessary future directions to promote better reflection and to deepen perspective-taking through the tangible puppetry.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:02Z (GMT).

However, educators continue to find it challenging to develop science agency – an action-oriented mindset, among students. In this paper, we evaluate a curriculum that encourages middle school students to identify problems that interfere with their daily lives and take action by creating mobile apps to resolve them. We analysed reflections of 13 students, who worked in pairs over a series of twenty-four 45-minute classes, to create mobile apps using App Inventor. Our findings suggest that enabling students to create socially relevant mobile applications can be a precursor to developing an action-oriented mindset.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:03Z (GMT).

When vibing with one another, skaters and videographers fall into collaborative, rhythmic cycles. This collaborative mastery is illustrated specifically through a focus on the cycles of reflection and nurture that skaters and videographers enter into when honing their respective crafts. This paper advances understanding of youth digital media production in the rich, yet understudied, action sports community, drawing out potential implications for the design of digital media learning settings, broadly. \","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:04Z (GMT).

Specifically, we investigate what kinds of messages elicit useful responses for those seeking help. We found that, compared to posts that contained only text, posts that contained media elements such as images and videos had a higher response rate and more resolved problems. Based on our analysis we attribute this to the more descriptive and explanatory power of multimedia elements and their ability to represent physical objects. The findings suggest that guidance for crafting messages using multimedia can lead to more equitable participation and learning in online Maker communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:05Z (GMT).

The present study investigates the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai, India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months. The experimental group played on a platform that supported instant sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All other aspects of both platforms were same. Analysis of process data of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement with the game. Students from control group lost interest in the game after some days, while experimental group students remained active on it till the end of the four-month period.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:07Z (GMT).

The problems identified in Course 1 included a high dropout rate, low participation in group work, and low course satisfaction. These are typical problems in large online courses. However, their significance increases when they occur in the context of small group collaboration.

We analyzed a data set of 30 elementary students learning fractions with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Our initial analyses focus on the link between use of language that is face-saving (e.g., marking identity with statements such as “we are great”) or face-threatening (e.g., insulting), and students’ preferences to collaborate and compete. We found only non-significant correlations between these two broad categories, but found significant correlations between dialogue indicators, such as the use of identity markers and joking, that suggest directions for subsequent studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:13Z (GMT).

The discussion in this paper serves as a first step in articulating how (1) CSCL tools can transgress and thus question official learning and working places and (2) how transgression can foster re-ordering of places and their practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:15Z (GMT).

Literature has revealed that learners had difficulties in collaborative argumentation on SSIs. The use of knowledge building pedagogies may be helpful for facilitating students’ collaborative argumentation. To examine the perspective above, this study attempted to integrate the KB pedagogies in collaborative argumentation regarding SSIs. In this study, learners’ collaborative learning behavior patterns in the context of online argumentation learning activities were explored. The participants were 48 university students from two classes and were randomly divided into experimental and control group (n=24 for both groups). The control group only received argumentation instruction, while the experimental group received explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation (CA) instruction (focusing on both argumentation instruction and collaboration nature of argumentation). Then, the two groups of students were asked to participate in KB-based argumentation for four weeks, in which the control group was provided with original KB-based openers in the KF while the experimental group was provided with CA-based openers additionally. Data was mainly from students’ online activities log files in KF. By analyzing the students’ knowledge building and collaborative argumentation behavioral patterns, this study found that these two groups of students revealed different collaborative learning behavior patterns. However, the students in the experimental group benefited more in both their knowledge building and collaborative argumentation from the proper adoption of knowledge building pedagogies and explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation instruction in online SSI-based argumentation learning activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:16Z (GMT).

Each year students studied human body systems over a whole school year using Knowledge Forum (KF). Both classes worked with an idea-centered, principle-based framework of knowledge building; students in class B (year 2) particularly engaged in reflective structuration to co-construct structures of inquiry as their work unfolded. Qualitative analyses of rich classroom data elaborated the reflective structuration process in class B. The analyses of student online discourse showed that compared to class A in year 1, class B made more purposeful and sustained contributions to understanding various human body systems and developed more sophisticated explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:17Z (GMT).
