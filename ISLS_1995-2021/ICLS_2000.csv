A follow-up study in three more classrooms yielded the dramatic reasoning gains we had been seeking, partly by addressing four unresolved issues from the prior research. First, addressing previous difficulties implementing GenScope in shared computer labs, the follow-up study used laptop computers installed in the biology classroom. Second, addressing problems establishing valid comparison classrooms, we established a more valid comparison classroom that did not encounter ""carry over"" from the GenScope classrooms. The third issue concerned continuing refinements made to the GenScope curriculum. The final issue concerned one aspect of that curriculum, formative assessments that used the familiar GenScope dragons to scaffold reasoning targeted in our summative assessments. By withholding these activities from one of two GenScope classrooms, the present study confirmed that this enhancement to ""systemic"" validity (Frederiksen & Collins, 1989) presented a small, acceptable degree of compromise to ""evidential"" validity. The specific results and the broader collaboration are considered in light of recent federal policy reports regarding educational technology, educational research, and assessment practices.",cognition,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Hickey.pdf,"assessment, learning environments, scaffolding, science education"

Significant differences were found both at the conceptual level and at the level of basic epistemological and ontological presuppositions and beliefs. It is suggested that helping students understand and use complex systems knowledge will require helping students construct a richer conceptual ecology which embraces both non-reductive and decentralized thinking, multiple causality, non-linearity, randomness, and so on. It is hoped that this research might contribute to efforts that are exploring ways for students to acquire a powerful conceptual toolkit based on emerging scientific and social science research into the dynamics of complex systems.",cognition,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Jacobson.pdf,"Cognitive science, modeling/models, science education, student beliefs."

The model has been developed in an empirical study where we examined the quality of asynchronous interaction in web-based conferencing. Because all successful communication presumes perspective-taking skills and reciprocal understanding among the participants, we studied whether the students are able to reach in reciprocal interaction and thus create educationally relevant high-level web-based discussion. The subjects of the study are pre-service teachers in the USA (N=40) and Finland (N=30) who use an asynchronous web-based tool called Conferencing on the Web (COW) to collaborate in creating joint case-based descriptions in different areas of teaching and learning. The results of the study point out different levels of web-based discussion. More specific analysis of the quality of each discussion level focused on perspective taking in communication. The results support our hypothesis that higher level perspective taking was related to higher level discussion. The relevancy of perspective-taking theory as a tool for analysing web-based discussion is discussed.",cognition,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Jarvela.pdf,"web-based learning, perspective-taking, electronic discussion"

We explore two key issues: teachers' beliefs about the functionality of the tool, and ways in which teachers customize it to support inquiry-based learning. Using interview data and software artifacts, the study explored some of the striking similarities and differences in beliefs and tool customization across three teachers engaged in the same instructional unit. Findings provide evidence for an initial category scheme of tool functions perceived by teachers to meet both teacher needs and student needs in scientific investigations. Additionally, teachers' customized Portfolio templates revealed a continuum of general-purpose to task-specific designs to scaffold student inquiry within or across science units. Implications for future research are discussed in light of these results, including a need to expand on the existing belief category scheme and customization examples, and a need to do longitudinal research that will shed more light on changing beliefs and use as a result of experience.",cognition,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Matese.pdf,"teacher beliefs and practices, science education"

The system is enriched with the mutual linking capability that requires the learners to explicitly think about and comment on relationships between two pieces of information. In a course on human problem solving the students first studied and reported some classical problem solving literature. The students are then asked to make relations among their presentations by utilizing ReCoNote's mutual linking function, and report to the class the linkages they made. In the third phase, a report on the characteristics of humans as problem-solving systems was required as the summary activity. The log data analyses reveal that the students visited other groups' notes often and as the course develops, links spread from within one's own group's notes to cover notes created by other members belonging to other study topics. Students who actively used the system tended to turn in high-quality summaries. The system has been used in three half-year classes and the initial analyses of the activities have revealed that this mutual linking did in fact help the learners learn rather complicated topics in cognitive science.",cognition,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Miyake.pdf,"cognitive science, higher education, learning environments, reflection"

Teachers need to learn new methods and content to enact reform-based curriculum. Educative curriculum material designed to address teacher learning as well as student, is one potential vehicle. Our work is embedded in an ongoing urban systemic initiative of a large public school district to reform science education. As part of this effort, science curriculum materials were developed that were consistent with constructivist ideas, addressed national and local goals for student learning and educative for teachers. Three middle-school teachers with limited experience with physics and project-based science enacted a 10 week, force and motion unit using educative curriculum materials. Classes were videotaped daily and teachers were interviewed periodically throughout the unit. Through qualitative analysis across data sources we found teachers used and learned from educative features in the materials. In addition, educative features addressing pedagogical content knowledge were used more often and more effectively than those that addressed either pedagogical or content knowledge. Our work indicates educative curriculum can facilitate teacher learning necessary for improved practice and informs development of materials for all teachers as well as those participating in urban reform.",cognition,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Schneider.pdf,"professional development, curriculum, science education, educational reform"

One particular challenge is how to introduce learning technologies within a currently enacted curriculum. To meet this challenge student supports must both be imbedded within the technology itself (intrinsic supports) as well as within the classroom (extrinsic supports). Learner centered design research (Soloway 1996; Stratford, 1996, Jackson, et al., 1996) has described several intrinsic supports which facilitates students in learning technologies. This study extends this line of research on the issues of imbedding learning technologies by concentrating on the classroom supports that enables technology to be introduced seamlessly within a curriculum.

Issues of expertise, automaticity, and competency are explored in a case study of a 8th grader in the domain of algebra equation solving. Multiple levels of competence, leading to expertise, are described.

A review of some of the existing literature within the domain of mathematics learning indicates that little useful theory has been developed to explain how conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge are related. A primary reason for this deficiency is that knowledge of concepts is treated as a multi-faceted and rich construct, while procedural knowledge is very narrowly defined and operationalized. Philosophical and historical foundations for this differential treatment are discussed. It is suggested that distinguishing between knowledge type and depth of knowledge illuminates alternative ways in which procedural knowledge can be known and understood.

This study examines a set of such models constructed during a high school investigation of a local creek. Affordances for the demonstration of conceptual, epistemological and strategic understandings were identified before searching for these understandings in the models. The computer models as a set represent a substantial portion (70%) of the scientific content in the creek project. Ecological content was most strongly represented in the models and most students were able to model causal linkages between biology, earth science, physical science and/or environmental science phenomena. The models potentially represent a much smaller proportion of the epistemological and strategic content of the project. However, these understandings were more tightly scaffolded by the task, so most of the models showed evidence of these types of understandings. Analysis of the content in the models provides evidence of the veracity of students' understandings.

The results of the pre- and post-tests show that students' understanding of chemical representations improved substantially (t=13.9, p<.001, effect size= 2.68). The analysis of video recordings reveals that several features in eChem helped students construct models and translate representations. Evidence also shows that high engagement students' discussions involved both visual and conceptual aspects of representations, which in turn may deepened their understandings of representations.

In particular, scaffolding in the form of prompts and hints are investigated for supporting causal explanations of scientific evidence (or argumentation) and promoting more general reflection. The results imply that both kinds of scaffolds support students' knowledge integration in important ways. The paper concludes with the claim that the guidance software helps students identify ways to improve their understanding by helping students think individually and collaboratively to provide alternative examples, thought experiments, and counter-evidence for consideration, and by providing a place to make their own thinking about these ideas visible and explicit.

The classical view of individual selection stresses the importance of competition between individuals for resources and survival. On this view, altruistic and cooperative behavior appear to be disadvantageous for evolutionary success. However, looking at evolution as a complex system, altruism and cooperation can be seen as valuable traits for individual survival. The EACH project developed hands-on materials that enabled students to engage and test their intuitions about the fitness and evolutionary success of altruistic behavior. The primary materials consisted of a set of multi-agent models (written in StarLogoT) and associated activities that guided students in exploring evolutionary scenarios.

In this paper we look at how a CoWeb ­ an unstructured collaboration space ­ was used to support a large college design class. Although the CoWeb was used for several purposes, we focus specifically on how it was used to support class discussions. We start with why we feel CoWeb discussions, and more generally online peer interaction, may be useful in light of our pedagogical goals. We then analyze the structure of the discussions and how students perceived them, and discuss how the online environment may have influenced behavior. From this analysis, we conclude the CoWeb was effective in helping students think about open-ended issues through online peer interaction.

In an earlier paper (Hansen, Schrimpsher, & Narayanan, 1998) we described a research project based on the premise that a rethinking of algorithm animation design is required in order to harness its power to enhance learning. The key insight was that for algorithm animations to be effective, they had to be ""chunked"" and embedded within a context and knowledge providing hypermedia information environment. In this paper, we report on ablation studies which were designed to discover which aspects of the prototype hypermedia visualization system that was developed (called HalVis) contributed to student learning. These preliminary studies led to a surprising discovery that interactive and animated analogies appear to significantly prime learning about abstract and dynamic algorithm behaviors from subsequent visualizations. We first present the interactive features and learning modules of HalVis. Two ablation experiments conducted on HalVis are then described.

We identify two key difficulties. Firstly, neither learners nor tutors, who are used to more traditional methods of teaching, know exactly what to expect from PBL or how to behave appropriately within their new roles. Secondly, these problems are compounded by having to interact within a socially unfamiliar computer-based learning environment. We frame these difficulties in terms of schema theory which suggests that people behave and know what to expect from situations according to mentally represented scripts describing the typical course of events. We apply computational descriptions of these scripts, i.e. PBL-protocols, which guide and control social interaction in virtual PBL groups according to (a) the phase of the learning process and (b) the specific roles of tutor, learner and expert; three roles which are typically distinguished in the problem-based learning method. The PBL-protocols restrict the type of contributions allowed for each role type for each phase of the PBL learning process.

Habits, for Thorndike, could be divided into the instinctive and the acquired. Within his psychology, both types of habits consisted of predispositions to respond in particular ways to particular stimuli. Habits were a primary concern for Dewey, as well. Most day-to-day conduct, he believed, is ruled by habit. When disrupted, however, conduct comes under the influence of impulse and intelligence. Dewey introduced the term inquiry for the process by which intelligence recovers a situation that has in some way become problematic.

However, past research has shown that simply placing mentoring opportunities at the disposal of all students is not enough to make telementoring effective on an equitable basis. When mentoring relationships are conducted via private media like e-mail, the students who most need to see models of successful mentoring are, in fact, the least likely to encounter them. In the worst case this leads to a ""rich get richer"" dynamic, in which only students with previous experience of supportive learning partnerships are able to draw benefit from them. In design experiments conducted in Toronto-area high schools, we orchestrated telementoring relationships in a Knowledge Forum(TM) database � an asynchronous, electronic group workspace. In this new model of telementoring, students could (and did) ""peek"" into the telementoring dialogues of their peers. This ""opportunistic model-seeking"", as we call it, allowed students to develop more sophisticated ideas about the kinds of advice and guidance they wanted from their mentors, defeating the ""rich get richer"" dynamic.

Technological infrastructure of the study was provided by the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environments (CSILE) The study applied social network analysis to investigate written comments logged by 28 grade 5/6 students to CSILE's database. The study indicated that although the density of interactions within the CSILE class was rather high, there were large individual differences in regard to participation in CSILE-mediated discourse. Further, the analysis revealed that average- and high-achieving female students dominated discourse interaction within the CSILE class, and carried the main responsibility for all students' collaborative building of knowledge. An important characteristic of CSILE students' culture of interaction was that female and male students interacted mainly within their respective gender groups. Within the groups a significant amount of communication took place between students representing different achievement levels.

74,"Windschitl, Mark",The Diffusion and Appropriation of Ideas: An Investigation of Events Occurring Between Groups of Learners in Science Classrooms,"Researchers have conducted numerous studies on the interactions of individuals within groups, however, there has been little research on phenomena occurring between groups of learners in classrooms. This exploratory study identifies and categorizes different events occurring between members of different learning groups in three ninth-grade physical science classrooms. Distributed cognition is used as a framework for describing how inter-group interactions serve to diffuse ideas throughout the collective, how these interactions influence the processes and products of students' work, and how characteristics of learning tasks themselves afford or constrain different kinds of inter-group interactions.",socialcontext,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Windschitl2.pdf,"science education, social cognition, high school"

However, working with online adults presents unique challenges for designers of educational technologies as well. In this panel, we will examine the issues affecting the design educational online communities that integrate adults, as well as the role that adults play in making these communities scale to many classrooms.",specialsessions,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Ellis.pdf,"computer-mediated communication, discourse, distributed learning environments, life-long learning"

In this symposium, discussion focuses on the relation between user and the site. Short presentations of four different sites will be followed by discussion of: (a) how change might be described; (b) the constraints and possibilities inherent in a site; and (c) how the ""culture"" of a virtual community might be described.",specialsessions,unknown,http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Renninger2-new.pdf,"computer-mediated communication, learning communities, learning environments"
