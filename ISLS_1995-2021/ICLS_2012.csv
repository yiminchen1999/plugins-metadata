The participants were working by turns on a common presentation that should outline their opinions on the topic. During this alternating process they had to think aloud to make individual processes observable. In addition, we analyzed the development of the shared text. We combined a content analysis and the think-aloud data to measure internal and external processes of knowledge construction, and we describe how these processes influenced each other. This procedure led to insights into the development of perception shared by the participants and into the resulting knowledge construction with respect to quantitative and qualitative processes. In particular, we analyzed the interplay between the participants' thinking and writing processes as well as the co-evolution of their thinking and writing as cognitive and social processes. In our conclusion we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding processes of knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

One reason for this disengagement is that learners are often not given the chance to choose how to pursue their personal goals using science reasoning. Therefore, we are creating science programs that emphasize life-relevant learning - the ability to engage science learners in the context of achieving their own goals. We developed Kitchen Chemistry to engage and support children in the design of their own personal investigations. In this paper, we use a case study analysis to examine three groups of learners in Kitchen Chemistry. We analyze the decisions that learners make, how learners make these decisions, and the supports needed to make informed choices. We examine how the use of semi-structured activities, whole group discussions, adult facilitation, and mobile technologies interact and support learners in their decision-making practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:32Z (GMT).

In this experiment students were engaged in discussion and reflection of the concept of promisingness and used a Promising Ideas tool to identify promising ideas in their written online discourse. They used the tool for two refinements of idea selections to focus ongoing community dialogue. Results suggest that students as young as 8 years of age can make promisingness judgments that facilitate knowledge advancement in their work. These results inform future work in classroom interventions and tool development to promote promisingness judgments in collaborative knowledge building.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:33Z (GMT).

In this paper we describe our analysis and methodology, which are shaped by the Ecology of Resources design framework (Luckin, 2010). Findings suggest teenagers are aware of energy issues at an abstract level, but do not apply this information in the context of their behaviour. We identify indirect energy use and the relative energy intensity of different behaviours as important areas for learning. For example, behaviours of particular relevance to teenagers are use of electronic devices, and choice of food and personal care products. These findings have implications for the design of technology to support learning about energy in informal contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We illustrate these concepts and our video research methodology within two case studies. The first case study concerns tactile reading with a visually impaired student at primary school. The second case study refers to a learning situation proposed by Brousseau (2004), the Treasure Game, which one can see as a fundamental situation for the representational process. By contrasting the two cases, we attempt to identify two different kinds of equilibration works. We show how these two different equilibration works involve different ways of articulating the twofold semiosis in the didactic transactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:36Z (GMT).

Drawing from observations and interviews with 35 high school youth that created e-textile artifacts, we identified three different approaches ranging from giving up on desired designs to making something functional or not finishing or getting a design to work because of unwillingness to give up on aesthetics.

This paper examines whether and how published LPs and LTs address issues of equity. It presents a case study where a curriculum guided by an LP closed or reduced gaps between mainstream and minority groups. We argue that implicit in most LP/LT work is a definition of equity as equal treatment for all students, and propose an alternate definition involving responsive instruction and materials that contemplate individual differences. From the analytic literature review and case study, we abstract guidelines for the development of LPs and LTs, and curriculum materials based on these, to make them more responsive to students and thus more equitable.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:37Z (GMT).

It follows that population correlation estimates of the relationship between self-efficacy and training transfer should be higher in those conditions that afford computer support and collaboration. This meta-analysis (29 studies, k = 33, N = 4,158) tested this assumption. Based on social cognitive theory, results suggested positive population correlation estimates between self-efficacy and transfer (U = 0.39). Results also showed that effect sizes were higher in trainings with rather than without computer support, and higher in trainings without rather than with collaboration. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of complex social and computer-mediated learning environments and their practical significance for scaffolding technology-enhanced learning and interaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:38Z (GMT).

Interviews are also conducted with students and teachers to further tease out the underpinnings of children's conception of learning. The content analysis of 183 drawings revealed that technological tools were more prominently featured in mix-achievement classes than high-achievement classes. The reasons for such discrepancy emanate from the distinct learning priorities of and strategies used by these two groups of students.

We detail how cooperative learning constructs were designed into the narrative and game mechanics, and how evidence of these features emerged during play. We found that the jigsaw puzzle design of game challenges supported collaboration between groups; daily, whole-class discussions strengthened group processing; and real-time, chat-based dialogue among students themselves and students with an in-game character enhanced promotive interaction (e.g., providing positive reinforcement).

In the learning process, the learners developed the following understanding in innovation diffusion: teachers' adoption decisions are based on limited rationality and local information; teachers have nonlinear influence on each other through social networks; teachers are heterogonous agents; and diffusion is a process of emergence. The learners also learnt to leverage on social networks to foster effective innovation diffusion. While agent-based model building faces challenges for learning CAS in the social science domain, this study shows that engaging learners in reflection activities helps to overcome the challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:40Z (GMT).

First we analyze learning in explicitly embodied cultural practices (e.g., surfing), then analogize to the implicitly embodied practice of mathematics. We next contextualize this analogy via interpreting data collected in a design-based research study, in which twenty-two 9-to-11-year-olds developed notions of proportionality through participating in guided problem-solving activities in an embodied-interaction space. In both surfing and mathematics, we argue, learners develop ""embodied artifacts,"" i.e. body-based and modular rehearsed actions. Embodied artifacts lend individuals entry into disciplinary competence via participation in action, refinement of operations, and integration into activity structures. Furthermore, embodied artifacts may become ""conceptual performances,"" wherein performance not merely augments, but stands for and constitutes understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:40Z (GMT).

An assessment of such maps can help to detect misconceptions and can serve as a basis for learner feedback. If used as a basis for agent-based scaffolding, the assessment needs to be calculated automatically by the system at run-time. Previous approaches have used an expert concept map as a reference for calculating such quality measures. This paper describes an approach that works without an explicit expert concept map but only uses more general domain ontology. To determine and adjust an automated quality measure student concept maps were collected and analysed by experts. The expert judgment was compared to certain structural measures based on graph-theoretical concepts and to enriched measures that additionally included ontology relations. It turned out that the inherent characteristic of concept maps as scale-free networks rules out certain structural measures as positive quality indicators.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:41Z (GMT).

We scored the conceptual content of the ideas students recorded, how students organized their ideas, and the coherence of students' explanations. Regression models show that students' ability to distinguish ideas predicted explanation coherence more strongly than the number of relevant ideas they recorded. Three cases illustrate difficulties some students had using molecular concepts to support their explanations. The findings demonstrate how this new technology can permit closer examination of students' learning progress and inform curricular refinements.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:42Z (GMT).

Results indicate that the individual-cognitive component was facilitated by the provision of heuristic worked-out examples, whereas the social-discursive component was fostered through the use of collaboration scripts and of heuristic worked examples. Both scaffolds were especially helpful for learners with higher general ability. It appears that scaffolds on a content level as well as scaffolds on a social level are necessary to help learners attain high levels of mathematical argumentation skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:42Z (GMT).

Recent models from a more situated perspective seem much more capable of explaining the variability seen empirically. This paper adds to this situated perspective by outlining a research approach for ""locating"" epistemic beliefs within analyses that triangulate between people's participation in knowledge construction and evaluation, the artifacts such participation may produce, and individual's reflection upon both participation and artifacts.

Results showed that students in the scripted condition outperformed students in the unscripted condition with respect to revision behavior and text-quality. Results from analyzing students' discussions during the writing activity revealed increased coordination concerning task division and increased communication frequency for students in the scripted condition.

High school students studied the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment unit, Global Climate Change in one of three conditions. We compare student learning outcomes. We find that traditional spacing resulted in larger gains, in apparent contrast to the findings of many studies of distributing practice. We further investigate this finding to understand how spacing might have impacted revisiting and restudying of earlier work. Specifically, we use log files to determine how students revisited earlier work, finding that condition moderated the effect of revisiting on outcomes. Students in the distributed condition tended to revisit proximal steps, whereas those in the clustered condition tended to revisit steps while writing explanations at the end of the unit. We discuss implications and directions for further study.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Typical questions implied by this stance include: How do we help students develop more accurate or fruitful knowledge structures? How do we overcome misconceptions in science or mathematics? How do we train skills more efficiently, employing what we know of human memory and learning? How do we encourage the growth of metacognitive skills? While such questions are interesting, this paper argues that they are ultimately peripheral for the purposes of designing effective educational technology. Indeed, the ""cognitive science stance"" tends to ignore or take for granted issues that are, in fact, much more central and productive in guiding design. These are questions rooted in anthropology, not cognitive science. They include: How and why do children make friends? What features of physical settings encourage (or discourage) the development of children's interest? Why, and in what situations, do children develop intense intellectual passions and obsessions? This paper discusses the sorts of questions that designers of educational technology need to ask in order to make progress beyond the confines of cognitive science research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:44Z (GMT).

I embark from the conjecture that these shortcomings result from cognitive discontinuity between intuitive forms of sense-making that deal with objects and actions and algebraic formulas traditionally used in this discipline. I propose and that a new form of representation, agent-based models, may offer greater cognitive continuity from sense-making to disciplinary knowledge. Study 1, an analysis of textbook content and lecturer practice, confirmed the cognitive-discontinuity conjecture by implicating the epistemic challenges of converting sense-making into formulas. Study 2 was a longitudinal evaluation of an agent-based, complementary curricular unit for materials science undergraduates. A micro-ethnographic case study of one student's progress through this unit documents the challenges and achievements of appropriating the agent based perspective as means of empowering sense-making.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:44Z (GMT).

We do so by offering a micro- genetic analysis of a relatively surprising case of transfer by a student in a high school biology class.

Comparing two classes across two years, we considered how the timing of feedback impacted student engagement. Findings suggest that providing consequential feedback in the form of a narrative outcome supported students to offer more mathematical justification, consequential justification, and to engage critically with the mathematical content within their written recommendations. The impact of consequential feedback appears to be potentially heightened by total time in class discussion, presence of more frequent discussions, and increased immersion in the narrative.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:46Z (GMT).

Findings suggest that students may follow multiple non-linear trajectories towards an increasingly coherent understanding of ecosystems. Even so, the ability to observe phenomena at multiple macro/micro and biotic/abiotic levels may be an underlying constraint to also observing integrated structure-behavior-function relations and the development of a more coherent understanding of ecosystems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:47Z (GMT).

Because representations are the only external input that learners use to make sense of imperceptible phenomena, the design of the representations becomes critical. However, studies imply that commonly used conventional visual representations tend to direct learners to overestimate imperceptible sizes and underestimate the difference between them. Hence, the need for a novel representation that can provide the way learners an alternative experience with the imperceptible sizes emerges. To address this issue, we designed a multimodal representation that incorporates temporal sense to transmit imperceptible sizes. In this paper, we introduce our recent research that explored the different effects of the compressed and extended form of temporal experience on student learning of the range of imperceptible sizes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:47Z (GMT).

However, the interpretation of latent topics is still a challenge, which hinders the use of this state-of-the-art technology from wider use in CSCL contexts. In a recent paper, we put forward a novel topic discovery method, the fLDA model, based on Minsky's Frame theory. This method has the advantage of providing outputs that are potentially more easily interpretable for generating the topic of each thematic cluster. In this paper, we show how fLDA can be used in extracting and visualizing the topics of asynchronous online discourse from four classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:49Z (GMT).

In the first study, students were either provided or not provided with monohybrid inheritance pre-requisites for their complex problem-solving activity. The second study compared a teacher-led with a student-led comparison and contrast during the consolidation phase. Findings of the first study suggested that students may not have adequate priors to generate representations and solution methods that explore multi-level conceptions. Findings of the second study suggested that teacher involvement in the compare-and-contrast may be beneficial for better knowledge assembly.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:49Z (GMT).

In the experimental condition, they received individual scores of dilatory behavior mirrored in a line chart. We were interested in whether potential advantages of the line chart can be traced back to non-specific signaling of dilatory behavior or to specific individual feedback. Therefore, we compared the experimental group with two control groups: without visualization or with random visualization. The random visualization was expected to have a signaling but no feedback effect. Results supported the effects of signaling and individual feedback. Participants with random or veridical visualizations were more likely to engage in self-reflection, but only those who received individual feedback were more likely to reduce their dilatory behavior and improved self- regulated learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:50Z (GMT).

Prior research on contextual interference has demonstrated that interleaving different types of learning tasks can foster a deep understanding of the underlying concepts. Do the same advantages apply to interleaving representations? In a classroom experiment, we compared four conditions that varied the practice schedules of multiple graphical representations between interleaving and blocking. The multiple-representation conditions were compared to three single-representation control conditions. During their regular classroom instruction, 290 4th and 5th-grade students worked for five hours with versions of an intelligent tutoring system for fractions. On several dependent measures, interleaving multiple graphical representations led to better learning results than blocking multiple graphical representations.

As a first step, we articulate a sequence of complex systems ideas - from the least to most difficult - by analyzing students' written responses. Using an Item Response Theory model, we found that the easiest ideas to grasp are those that relate to the interconnected nature of these systems whereas the most difficult ideas are those concerning the decentralized organization of the system, and the predictability of the system effects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:51Z (GMT).

Results suggest that personalization allowed students to form more accurate and meaningful situation models of story problems, facilitating algebraic symbolization. Interest-based interventions may allow learners to make critical connections between personally relevant scenarios and abstract representational systems.

On the other hand, researchers have highlighted empirical evidence showing that `pure' discovery- based learning is of limited value. This suggests that how learners interact is important in predicting whether learning occurs. This paper reports on a study of 158 university students who each used two instructional simulations one with a discovery-based design and the other with a tutorial-based design. Students' learning outcomes were assessed via pre-tests and post-tests of conceptual understanding. Students' interactions using the discovery-based program were recorded and coded as either systematic or unsystematic. The results showed that when compared with the tutorial-based learning program systematic exploration resulted in learning benefits, while unsystematic exploration did not. These results have implications for the design of instructional software if such resources are to be used effectively.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In order to properly deal with the ""wicked problems"" arising from this interaction, learners must recognize that there is ""no right answer"", since solutions require compromise. They must also use spatial concepts instrumentally to reason about these systems. We propose to address these challenges by adapting authentic complex human-natural systems models into collaborative learning experiences. To do so, we need to better understand the challenges learners face as they use simulations to link spatial reasoning with dynamic processes. This paper presents two cases where we examine learners' spatial and problem-solving strategies as they interact with a modified stormwater management model. We show that learners require support for core spatial reasoning skills and for problem solving around wicked problems. We then recommend forms of scaffolding and further development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

At the same time, over the last 15 years, Learning Sciences as a field has been quite innovative, eclectic, and effective in incorporating new methodological stances, such as micro-genetic methods, micro- ethnographies, and design-based research. It seems that the time has come to build sound connections between these traditions. The goal of this symposium is to bring together researchers coming from different academic perspectives, to explore and examine common LA/EDM methodological and theoretical threads with wide applicability within the Learning Sciences. The papers presented explore text mining in clinical interviews, moment-by- moment learning curves and traces, data mining of programming logs, and cognitive tutors, representing the main perspectives and methodological approaches in the field.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:44Z (GMT).

Specifically, we aim to study aspects of the platform that allow us to investigate learning related to: (a) the integration of game mechanics into the design of instructional materials, (b) youths' engagement in contemporary scientific practices, and (c) platform features that make youths' interests, expertise, and experiences visible so that they can be leveraged in instruction. We explore how to promote generative conditions for expertise development within these technology-mediated social learning networks and the effects of those experiences on student participation, identification, and learning of knowledge, skills, and practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:44Z (GMT).

A research study was designed to explore children's development of argumentation in an Australian primary mathematics classroom. The classroom of 23 children (aged 9-10) had regularly used an inquiry-based approach to address extended, complex, ill-structured problems. The children's discussions and use of evidence is reported as they considered contentious media claims. The results of the design-based research study suggest that the children became proficient with Toulmin's argument framework (simplified). They were able to use this framework to plan, implement and defend the outcomes of a mathematical investigation they designed to provide evidence for or against the media claims. The paper highlights benefits and challenges with which student grappled while making and substantiating their final claims.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:44Z (GMT).

The resulting discourse trajectories are shown to give a holistic and also a detailed view on how knowledge advances when their interpretation is combined with a qualitative analysis of the content of the ideas and their relations. The weighted relevance of relations between ideas enables the identification of sub-topics in the discourse, important ideas, and influence or uptake events.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:45Z (GMT).

A central goal was to identify challenges to achieving emic or self-organized structure necessary for sustaining innovative educational programs. The study found that a local social and emotional dynamic influenced the emergence of a strong global dynamic of social support that ultimately produced the contextual outcome of low productivity. The paper asserts that teachers need intentional training to gain skills for working autonomously. Helping teachers become aware of the dynamics needed for successful collaboration would assist in achieving self-organized participation. An important contribution of this study is the application of a dynamic systems lens, which enabled the location of levels of micro and macroscopic influences that can be used to inform future professional development activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:45Z (GMT).

During the iterative cycles of inquiry learning, learners' prior domain knowledge is modified, refined, and further developed, provided that learners act upon self-assessments of their understanding and that they can actually think of appropriate hypotheses. Furthermore, knowledge about inquiry strategies influences the quality of the learners' inquiry activities, and the lack thereof requires compensatory support. This symposium brings together recent work about the role of prior knowledge for inquiry learning and ways to compensate for the lack of it. The four papers focus on the role of learners' self-assessment of their current understanding for their subsequent inquiry activities, on the gradual refinement of their knowledge on the basis of reflection, and on prior presentation of theoretical background information and concurrent presentation of inquiry strategies as ways to compensate for lack of prior theoretical knowledge and strategy knowledge, respectively.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:46Z (GMT).

Conceptually, it is hard to distinguish between nave and sophisticated beliefs, and methodologically, common statistical techniques yield inconsistent results. In response to these challenges, a new instrument to measure high school students' epistemic beliefs was designed and validated. The 55-item instrument contained three scales (absolutism, multiplism, evaluativism), that reflected different stages in epistemic development (Kuhn, 1991; 1999), moving from nave to sophisticated beliefs. Rasch analysis was used to analyze the data. The analysis confirmed the existence of the three scales with moderate reliability coefficients.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:47Z (GMT).

To do so, we employ a theoretical framework that characterizes forms of participation in defining, and illustrates how these aspects contributed to developing a mathematical system of definitions. The teacher, taking the role of a disciplinary representative, supported this co-establishment by modeling aspects of definitional practice, by positioning students as participants in practice, and by positioning definitions at the forefront of discussion. As students began to appropriate definitional practices, they, in turn, became supporters of their collective enterprise of defining. These characterizations of definitional practices and supports may provide resources for developing similar classroom environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:48Z (GMT).

In this paper, we describe the theoretical underpinnings that guided the design of WiMVT framework, the components and core features as well as the work flow of WiMVT. We elucidate our development process that supports the development of the system. To examine the functional usability and evaluate its impact on students' learning, a pilot study was conducted to show the findings with implications for how to improve the functionalities of the existing, briefly present the learning outcomes of lessons with the system, and provide feedback to the researchers, designers and teachers. Keywords: WiMVT; science learning; inquiry Background Learning science through inquiry that incorporates Information and Communication Technologies and scientific practices has been a desired pedagogical approach for science learning. In recent years, a number of computer- supported inquiry-based science learning environments have been developed, studied and evaluated, such as WISE, Co-Lab, Inquiry Island, and nQuire. Substantial evidence reported such learning environments could facilitate the development of cognitive and metacognitive strategies in the pupils (Schwarz &amp; White, 2005). Due to benefits for learners and the educational demand for a new science learning environment to effectively support the class and meeting the societal demands on science education, a group of researchers at Learning Sciences Laboratory, National Institute of Education in Singapore endeavours to develop a web-based science learning environment named WiMVT system (Web-based inquirer with Modelling and Visualization Technology, http://www.sstlsl-wimvt.sg/wimvt/). It is designed as an innovative learning environment in which modelling and visualization, inquiry and social interaction brought together and integrated. With a number of features, the system is targeted to support secondary school students to acquire sophisticated understanding of scientific conceptions, develop crucial learning skills (inquiry skills, modelling skills, collaborative learning skills) and reasoning skills, as well as reflective thinking skills. We will present a pilot study of WiMVT system, which happened at the stage of the development of simplified version. It is hoped this study could contribute to narrowing the gap between the design and development of a science learning environment and its actual usage and enactment in the classroom practice. Theoretical Underpinnings The pedagogical principles in model-based inquiry serve as the guide for design decisions on the framework of the WiMVT system. Different teaching patterns were formed and demonstrated in relevant studies. White and Frederiksen (2002) proposed an inquiry cycle that consisted of ""question-predict-experiment-mode-apply"". The results indicated that both of lower and higher achieving students benefit from this inquiry model. The inquiry phases in the Inquiry Island were described with questions, hypothesis, plan, investigation, creation and evaluation of models, and the evaluation of models and research processes. It was proposed to facilitate students' sociocognitive and metacognitive development (White, et al., 2002). Christina and Gwekwerer (2007) designed an inquiry framework EIMA: Engage-Investigate-Model-Apply. This inquiry pattern encouraged students' engaging in the guided inquiry with a focus on creating, using and revising models. In summary, despite of using different teaching patterns, these studies pointed to the necessity of having modelling as an important component in science inquiry. And the model-based inquiry process could mainly include orientation or question, hypothesis, plan, investigation, model, and conclusion (Bell, et al., 2010). With modelling as one of major strategies to visualize and examine students' conceptual understanding in science class, and guided by the relevant design and the educational principle: Predict-Observe-Explain (POE) adopted in science class in some Singapore schools (White &amp; Gunstone, 1992), as it has been demonstrated as an effective way to examine students' prior knowledge and conceptual changes. Thus, we propose a phase named Pre-model with corresponding Model in the inquiry cycle to probe students' conceptual transformation process. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis discussed above, considering other prominent learning environments' design, a revised model-based inquiry cycle proceeded with eight phases is proposed: Contextualize, Question &amp; Hypothesize (Q&amp;H), Pre-model, Plan, Investigate, Model, Reflect, and Apply. These eight phases are refined as the components of the WiMVT inquiry cycle. Icons were used to denote each phase of the inquiry cycle in the system.

Specifically, students were tasked with producing autobiographical radio documentaries in the style of This American Life. We used the development of metarepresentational competence (MRC) as our measure for how effectively students engaged with identity in their production process. We found three types of MRC trajectories: Students who demonstrated MRC throughout the process, students who demonstrated MRC late in the process, and students who never demonstrated MRC. Students who demonstrated MRC created pieces that took advantage of the affordances of radio as a mode for self-representation as they communicated their personal stories and reflected on the relationship between tools and ideas in sophisticated ways. Our findings can inform the design of learning environments within fields of artistic production as well as other content areas emphasizing the importance of ""identity work"" in learning, a focus in recent design-based learning sciences research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:48Z (GMT).

Our approach is based on design- ing feedback according to the principles of goal-alignment, context-relevancy, integrated cog- nitive and metacognitive support, and a conversational approach to feedback delivery. We tested this feedback approach on 43 8th-grade students, and our findings illustrate that: (1) stu- dents conversational choices provide valuable insight into their current mental state, (2) de- spite the help, some students struggled to learn using the system.

However, Productive Failure has usually been compared to Direct Instruction in studies with several confounds. These evaluations, therefore, do not allow conclusions regarding the underlying learning mechanisms. To address this criticism, we compared four conditions in a quasi-experimental study with 154 10th graders: We varied the form of instruction in two Direct Instruction conditions (a regular DI condition and a DI-S condition where instruction built on typical student-generated representations) and the type of support students received in two Productive Failure conditions (a regular PF condition and a PF+ condition with additional cognitive support). Our results indicate that students benefit from introducing new concepts based on student-generated representations. Moreover, during generation motivational support seems sufficient, that is, students do not need cognitive support.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Specially, we argue that if a student has greater influence over a shared artifact developed by the group, then they may have greater Perceived Authority as well as Access to the Conversational Floor and Interactional Space. They may also be able to influence the group's collaborative decisions despite challenges to the Perceived Merit of their ideas. Based on the impact of the shared learning artifact on these interdependent dimensions, we discuss how a student's power and influence is perpetuated in collaborative group work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:53Z (GMT).

We describe several socially-situated variables that drive the formulation of epistemic aims and the consequent selection of epistemic actions dimensions of interpersonal relationships compatible or conflicting with epistemic goals, constraints that arise from completing classroom tasks, and personal affiliations with target topics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:54Z (GMT).

Using a cross- sectional approach, student learning was assessed using an independent measure aligned with a learning progression on the transformations of matter. To develop the learning progression and corresponding assessment, we used construct-center design. Using IRT and analysis of variance, we demonstrate that students' latent ability changes across grade level, illustrating that curriculum coherence can, indeed, support students in building understanding of core chemistry ideas. We also found that boys and girls did not perform differently, in contrast with other findings, particularly in urban U.S. middle schools, in which girls outperform boys.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:54Z (GMT).

Findings suggest that the pre-service teachers were able to identify and respond to a variety of aspects of their students' inquiry, although we identified disagreements between what they responded to and what we considered important aspects of student inquiry.

Teams of students with greater initial intrinsic motivation or a greater increase in intrinsic motivation during the activity had higher programming scores. Wiki activity contributed to outcomes. Age was negatively associated with outcomes indicating possibly the program is more conducive to middle school students. Findings contribute to scholarly debates on incompatibilities between discovery learning due to cognitive load, and self-determination theory. Introduction This paper reports findings from the 2009/2010 school year of a Constructionist digital literacy project being conducted with students and educators in the state of West Virginia involving a state-wide network of classrooms engaged in game design learning and purposeful social media use among youth. Middle school, high school and community college students (N = 386) enroll in a blended learning game design elective course offered daily, for 1 or 2 semesters, credit and a grade. The paper explores teams' motivational orientation and active program work in relation to their learning outcomes, in the context of a guided discovery-based curriculum in which students and educators co-learn together in this social learning system. Literature Review Computational game making activities can enhance students' meta-cognition, self-regulation, and computational thinking (e.g., Harel &amp; Papert, 1991; Harel, 1991; Kafai, 1995; Kafai &amp; Ching, 1998; Papert, 1980). Research supporting these findings has been conducted under the educative ""framework for action"" Constructionism (Papert, 1980; Harel and Papert, 1991). Constructionism draws upon both Piaget's constructivist theory and Vygotsky's social constructivist theory. Adherents design and implement learning innovations and environments that foster learners' conscious creation of a meaningful, computational public artifact (e.g. a game), created and shared in a reflective, workshop environment of peer and expert-guided scaffolding (Harel and Papert, 1991). This study centers on a program of game design that employs a range of web 2.0 technologies including Flash and a wiki e-learning platform. In the co-learning model, the students engage in self-driven learning while their educators are still novices, using the provided resources. This activity can be characterized as guided discovery-based learning. Discovery-based learning While some argue that students can feel frustrated during discovery-based learning, others argue that students can enjoy it (Reynolds &amp; Harel Caperton, 2011). Reynolds &amp; Harel Caperton (2011) find contrasts in student perceptions of both enjoyment and challenge in the discovery-based context investigated here during the prior school year, given that occasionally novice learners must seek out learning supports to meet design needs in the moment. Kirschner, Sweller &amp; Clark (2006) criticize ""discovery-based learning"" for creating excessive cognitive load due to lack of structure and distraction in the search process that reduces student motivation. In contrast, self-determination theory (SDT, Deci &amp; Ryan, 2008) argues that three primary constructs underlie intrinsically motivated human behavior, and are innate needs: the need for autonomy (to have choice and control over one's life), for competence (to be effective), and for social relatedness (to feel connected to others, loved, and cared for) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2008; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985). Level of autonomy afforded by a given environment, and the intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientation of individuals play roles in their experience and fulfillment. Given the autonomy-supportiveness of the designed intervention, we propose the following hypotheses. Hypotheses. H1. Teams with higher mean intrinsic motivation have higher team scores. Given the guidance, scaffolding and support from both teachers and non-profit staff, along with resources provided in the blended e-learning environment, we expect that even those students who are more controlled in their self- regulation style will also succeed and perform well in the program because the necessary supports have been provided for those who might need them. H2. Teams with more extrinsically-oriented self-regulation have higher team scores. Furthermore, in addition to the generalized holistic inventories outlined above, student motivation towards the specific contextual range of activities in which they engage might be related to subsequent team scores. H3. Teams with greater increases in motivation towards program activities have higher team scores. Finally, given students' active engagement and use of a wiki, we explore the extent to which such activity may contribute to game design outcomes. H4. Teams with more wiki activity have higher team scores.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In contrast, we approach collaboration analytically as a way of acting. We define acting collaboratively as consistent alignment as to the focus of talk, and taking turns to complete the task while following the specified rules.

This approach, known as informant design approach, enables young people to draw on their cultural experiences in learning and gaming as resources for game development. In the three- year research and development project, we conducted five progressive informant design workshops with twenty adolescent learners, where their conceptions of earth science as well as ideas for game design are considered at its various stages of educational game development. Our findings from the qualitative analysis of video and artifacts draw attention to the learners' cultural models of learning and gaming and discuss the importance of engaging learners as informants of educational game design. Introduction Young people may often be thought to be ignorant of what is best for them. This paper attempts to position learners as the best resources in knowing what engages them in a learning environment, for educational game design. Such a disposition to game development is inspired by Gee's (2003) argument about cultural models and the role they play in learning. According to Gee (2003), cultural models are: stories or images of experience that people can tell themselves or simulate in their minds, stories and images that represent what they take to be ""normal"" or ""typical"" cases or situations ... We act with others and attempt to make sense of what they are doing and saying. We interact with the media of our society and attempt to make sense of what is said and done there, as well. (p. 146) Bartlett and Holland (2002) would concur that learners bring their cultural models to learning environments. Using the term ""cultural worlds"", Bartlett and Holland argue, ""cultural worlds are continuously figured in practice through the use of cultural artefacts or objects inscribed by the collective attribution of meaning"" (p.12). It was our aim to involve learners in our game design by providing them with opportunities to reflect on their cultural model of the way they think about learning and gaming and use their ""funds of knowledge"" (Gonzlez, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005) as resources for the design. In this paper, we describe how the design approach, known as the informant design approach, has helped us understand young people's cultural models of learning with games. In this approach, we were able to create commonalities of experiences among the learners so as to help them reflect upon their cultural models of learning and game play. We were also able to explore ways to better encourage learners to use their own funds of knowledge for learning and designing by crossing the boundaries between their formal classroom learning and their cultural practices. The findings highlight the use of their cultural models as resources for the design as well as their cultural models being challenged by the constraints of designing an ""educational"" game, which they also felt should be different from commercial games they were familiar with. Methodology: Informant Design Approach With the emergence of new technologies, how you learn in and out of the classroom is drastically changing. At the same time, today's youths are not only the users of emerging technologies but also creators of many contents occupying them. In recent years, the idea of involving the target users of educational resources or tools during the development stages has been cited as a more efficient approach in meeting the pedagogical needs of those who may use the resources or tools. Many studies have reported the merits of such an approach, namely to allow the users' contributions to be effected into the redesign processes (Scaife &amp; Rogers, 1999) to gain access to the first-hand knowledge of the users' needs and preferences (Antle, 2003; Scaife &amp; Rogers, 1999); to tap on the creativity of the users (Antle, 2003; Rudd, Colligan, &amp; Naik, 2006; Scaife &amp; Rogers, 1999); and to help very young children to express their ideas (Walsh et al., 2010). Of note is Facer and Williamson's (2004) argument that when co-designing educational technologies with their target users, the following benefits of such an approach are evident: ""(i) it offers first hand experience of the needs, interests and requirements of end-users; (ii) it enables developers to be surprised by users and to avoid creating formulaic work; (iii) it allows developers to avoid costly mistakes and identify design difficulties at an early stage; and (iv) it offers the opportunity to create resources that are embedded in teaching strategies and educational contexts, and which consequently, actually achieve their educational aims"" (p. 1). Depending on the roles of the young people, the processes are called user-centered design, participatory design, and informant design approaches (Facer &amp; Williamson, 2004).

Relying on techniques of grounded theory and microanalysis of discourse, I addressed the question: How do students vary in their individual propensities for managing uncertainty they experience during collaborative academic tasks? In particular, I examined variation in the size and composition of the set of strategies from which students drew, changes in students' use of strategies across projects, and their willingness to entertain or take up uncertainty.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:01Z (GMT).

Our goal is to identify the strategies students used when using this simulation, and investigate the kinds of abstractions they made about the underlying agent-level mechanisms and emerging population-level outcomes of the model. We answer these questions using data collected from three high school biology classes that used this simulation. Our findings indicate that Bird Breeder was effective in fostering learning about the agent-level mechanisms that drive artificial selection. In contrast, the effectiveness of Bird Breeder at helping students learn about population-level outcomes of artificial selection is less clear.

We have developed a flexible technology layer that supports the aggregation of peer responses, including the collection of student explanations and semantic tags. We investigate collaborative inquiry scripts and discuss how they must comprise both the (macro) scripts that are enacted over a long-term curriculum, and the (micro) scripts that are enacted in class. We outline our rationale for inquiry design in Physics, the role scripting and orchestration play in the successful implementation of this curriculum, the role of the ""smart classroom"" in their enactment, and three successive iterations of our curriculum. Knowledge Communities for 21st Century Learning As we move further into the ""knowledge age"" today's workplace is shaped by new technologies, where activities are increasingly data-driven, collaborative, and predicated on a set of fundamental skills commonly referred to as information literacies (Livingstone, 2008). This shift is particularly pronounced across STEM disciplines, where workplace practices are shifting towards large, data-intensive, multidisciplinary collaborations across ever-widening spatial and temporal scales (e.g., the Human Genome project). A theoretical perspective from the learning sciences that is well suited to learning and instruction in the knowledge age is that of knowledge communities, as exemplified by the Fostering Communities of Learners (FCL) project (Brown &amp; Campione, 1996), and Knowledge Building (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1996), amongst others. These researchers have advanced an epistemological perspective where students consider learning as a social process, and value the collective knowledge of their peers. Although difficult to enact (Sherin et al, 2004), the knowledge community approach has garnered renewed attention, partly as a result of Web 2.0 capabilities, which can support complex pedagogical constructs (Slotta &amp; Najafi, 2010). Using ""Web 2.0"" technologies, students are active participants in a knowledge community that is engaged in the production, aggregation, and assessment of science topics, with an emphasis on inquiry and collaboration (Peters &amp; Slotta, 2010). The socially-oriented process of adding of meta-data (tags) to user- contributed content can provide opportunities to reveal meaningful connections and flexible real-time representations (Mathes, 2004). However, questions still remain about how such collections of content can best serve student learning and foster knowledge communities. Reflection and scripting, are two important aspects of such research and will be discussed in the present paper","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

They averaged more diagrams, 14% more correct enn diagrams, and 9.4% more correct domain inferences when using the digital pen interface. An error analysis further revealed that construction of multiple diagrams effectively suppressed scoping errors (e.g. overgeneralizations), the most common inference error. Implications are discussed for designing educational interfaces that improve students' visual fluency skills and related reasoning abilities, especially in low performers. ntroduction and ypotheses ne important ob ective for the design of future educational interfaces is to stimulate basic thinking and reasoning, including reducing systematic errors that undermine cognition. Recent research has highlighted that digital pen interfaces can substantially facilitate thinking by supporting the expression of different types of representation (e.g., linguistic, diagram, symbol, number). They elicit 44% more nonlinguistic representations, like diagrams, compared with keyboard-based computer interfaces ( viatt, in press; viatt, iller &amp; Hodge, in press). iagramming can make information more visually available to think about, especially if it is well matched with a task domain and makes alternatives visually explicit (Bauer &amp; ohnson-Laird, 1993). ast research has revealed that communicating more nonlinguistic content simultaneously stimulates a 36% higher level of appropriate biology hypotheses. Furthermore, knowledge of students' level of nonlinguistic communication predicted 72% of the total variance in their idea production ( viatt, in press). Related findings demonstrated that students' active construction of diagrams and marks also were associated with 25-36% higher problem-solution scores, compared with matched problems in which students did no diagramming or marking ( viatt, in press). These findings support an Activity theory view that communicative activity directly mediates thought, if well matched with a task domain. They also emphasize the importance of designing educational interfaces that support nonlinguistic representations as an aid in thinking, especially spatial ones like diagrams. The current research specifically explores whether: A digital pen will elicit more diagrams and more correct enn diagrams, compared with a non-digital pen A digital pen will selectively stimulate a higher percentage of correct inferences when students diagram ultiple diagramming will suppress overgeneralization errors, improving inference accuracy ethods articipants were twenty-three low-performing English speakers between 18 and 24 years of age, half male and female. All were expert users of keyboard interfaces, but none had ever used a digital pen interface. They solved three-statement inference problems by producing as many valid conclusions as possible, half using an Anoto- based digital pen and paper interface and half using a regular pen and paper. Students learned that the digital pen was a computer that could interpret and transmit their writing, and they were shown its features and given practice using it. In one condition, they were told not to make an diagrams while working, and in another they were given a enn diagram tutorial and instructed to ""make one or more enn diagrams before solving the inference problems. Students worked alone and had 3 mins. per problem (for details, see viatt et al., in press). Scoring included the total number of diagrams drawn, total correct enn diagrams, percentage of correct enn diagrams, percentage of correct conceptual inferences, percentage of correct er atim inferences (i.e., correct inferences, given the diagram constructed), and inference errors (e.g., overgeneralizations). Inter- rater reliability averaged 81-99%. Students' averaged 50% correct inferences overall (range 21.1%-78.6%). Results and Discussion Compared with using a non-digital pen, when students used the digital pen interface they drew significantly more enn diagrams per problem by ilcoxon signed ranks test [[ = 1.17 v. 1.25; = 1.76, = 9, p &lt; .04, one- tailed].

Analyses showed that both the pre-service teachers and the university supervisor recognized that the former used many ideas elaborated online.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:04Z (GMT).

However, Bereiter is critical of the model because it does not address whether understanding is deepened in the process of socialization, externalization, combination and internalization. To address this issue of understanding, this study proposed a framework that synthesizes the basic phases of problem-based learning with Nonaka's model. This design-based study investigated if a course designed based of this synthesized framework can help stimulate knowledge creation that is based on deepening understanding. Based on analysis of multiple data sources, the findings suggest that the participants demonstrated advancing understanding amidst knowledge creating conditions and processes consistent with Nonaka's model and the problem-based learning approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:06Z (GMT).

The findings suggest that neither worked examples alone nor interactive visualization experiences alone are as helpful as the combination. While worked examples are effective instructional devices to assist learning, due to students' limited self-explanation skills, virtual experiments are needed to elicit more metacognitive efforts when studying the examples. At the same time, worked examples provide direct guidance that can prevent potential frustration with the visualization.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

From a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives, the panelists discuss what interest and engagement are as research constructs; some of the design principles, key features of instructional materials, and contextual factors that trigger and shape interest and engagement; how learner characteristics influence the ways students select or respond to opportunities to engage; the roles that interest and engagement play in learning; and issues of measurement.

Action research takes as its raison d'tre creating the conditions for and the assessment of effectiveness within local contexts, but often is criticized for failing to produce generalizable knowledge. We propose educational improvement research as a middle course.

Participants are then prompted to generate examples of phenomena that follow each pattern. Preliminary analysis suggests that students have rich intuitive knowledge regarding general patterns that transcend various domains.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:22Z (GMT).

Traditional desktop environments for collaborative learning have included interactions between groups and computer agents with conversational abilities. Robots can take the collaboration out of the computer and into the three dimensional, real world environments of students. This symposium raises the important question of how advanced technologies, such as robotics, may enable us to take the same insights from the area of scripted collaboration and use them to support groups of learners in these environments. Other topic areas include design choices in robotic features that may influence scripted interactions, social behavior, meaningful engagement, and conditions that dynamically support situational factors and generate collaborative learning among students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:23Z (GMT).

Observations and student notes suggest that the activity helped students demonstrate their knowledge of bacterial growth by formalizing it from a list of unorganized facts into an accurate pseudo-computational model. In completing their task, they also critically reflected on the assumptions built into the modeling activity itself, and demonstrated familiarity with some core principles of complex systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:24Z (GMT).

The specific focus is on the social functions and social occasioning of practices across settings. The first two papers examine two common interactional arrangements--questioning and imitation--and the qualities of these arrangements across settings. The final two papers examine two common childhood activities in context--building with blocks and watching television--in order to understand how children engage in these activities and how that engagement is mediated by different interactional arrangements across settings. The combined effect of these papers is to begin to map the socio-material arrangements and interactional routines that contribute to young children's everyday learning, a neglected focus in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:27Z (GMT).
