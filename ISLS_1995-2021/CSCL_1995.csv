Industry design practice suggests that users should be able have direct control of the windowing display system. In order to conform to industry practice the IdeaWeb was redesigned from a single window display system to a modeless tiled window display system. It was assumed that a modeless windowing system would be preferable because the underlying graphic display system was dynamic. The results indicate that the students generally opted for a single window display system which is consistent with much of the previous research. Sequence data from the event logs demonstrate that students chose to treat the modeless window as static or modal. It appears that the students were concentrating on the cognitive task of managing the on-going computer mediated discussion. This study has important consequences for screen and window design not only for developing on-line conference systems, but within multimedia systems that have dense cognitive material. If the cognitive requirements of the main window are high, then a titled windowing system that requires little user intervention appears to be the design choice. However, if the requirement to recall information from window to window is low then a single window system display system is more appropriate. This would reduce not only the cognitive but the design and programming overhead as well.",Papers

When a collaborative situation makes team members dependent on each other's actions for success, their negotiations during problem solving ought also to provide a window into their reasoning. However, in work with young children none of this is straightforward. At first sight their collaboration may look like it creates more opportunities for misunderstanding than for learning, and their reasoning does not make the conceptual content very explicit. A hermeneutic analysis which follows simultaneously the development of the varying perspectives from which the individual participants' understand the task, and the development of a joint approach to the task may provide a useful window into the learning process. The paper presents some highlights from an example of this kind of hermeneutic analysis. The development of the interaction between two children playing a new game intended to promote a conception of ""the system of numbers as a whole-to-parts system""'illustrates how children may provide each other with learning experiences even in the midst of misunderstanding.",Papers

Relevant knowledge for work and for learning is distributed in our head, in the heads of others, and in the environment. Learning webs are used by (virtual) communities of practice. Domain-oriented design environments (DODEs) support learning webs by allowing all stakeholders in a design process to learn and work collaboratively with each other and with their computational environments. DODEs serve as models for the design of collaborative working and learning environments by exploring and supporting different relationships and task responsibilities between humans and computers. DODEs integrate working and learning by grounding learning in self-directed, authentic activities. They support learning on demand as an essential element of life-long learning. The creation of DODEs faces the fundamental challenge to make them simultaneously learner-directed and supportive. DODEs transcend other computer-supported cooperative learning systems, which employ the computer only as a medium with few interpretable components. They integrate humans and computational resources more creatively by acknowledging that persons become skill resources only when they consent to do so, whereas computational environments are available at the bidding of the user.",Papers

In particular, one element poorly supported is workspace awareness: the up-tothe-minute knowledge a student requires about other students' interactions with the shared workspace. This awareness is essential if students are to learn and work together effectively. We present a framework of several types of awareness required by students in a collaborative learning situation, including their social, task, concept and workspace awareness. We then concentrate on workspace awareness, and describe how particular awareness requirements of students in group learning situations depend on the closeness of their tasks, and whether they are sharing the same view or have separate views into the workspace. From these requirements, we have prototyped several awareness widgets for educational groupware. These widgets help learners maintain awareness of o ther learners' locations when their views are separated, of other learners' activities in shared and separate view situations, and of other learners' past activities.",Papers

However, adding a shared workspace to an audioconferencing setting may lead to less equal participation, and participants' reportings indicated it may have a negative effect on the amount of effort learners put into the task performance. In contrast, audio-conferencing only seems to lead to more effort by all participants. Effort may be positively related to mental processing and learning, which leads to hypothetical technology selection guidelines.",Papers

Findings are derived from a three year ethnographic study of an international, 400 member group of academics who communicated with each other using ListServer technology on ten, subsequently five electronic mailing lists. Using Soviet Activity Theory and a Conversation for Action discursive model of communication to make sense of the flow of on-line communication, three recurrent patterns of communicative activity were identified as constitutive, though irreducible, to what was termed electronic academia. These patterns of communication were referred to as academic, administrative and community-building action, one of which is succinctly illustrated and discussed here. Characteristic features of community-buildingdiscourse selectively included here are naming the community; and civil language uses (i.e. warm and playful; grateful and positive uses). Functions of community-building action briefly presented are growth and continuity. Together, mediating functions and features of community-building are seen as foundation for productivity and conceptual change.",Papers

Designing sustainably engineered solutions requires weighing the qualities of different proposals from a variety of different perspectives and handling a variety of tradeoffs simultaneously. Of necessity, these problems must be solved in multidisciplinary groups. Students, therefore, need to learn not only what their own disciplines have to say about the issues, but they also need to be able to recognize other issues that arise and to know which disciplines can contribute to their solutions. Thus, students need to learn how to recognize new issues and to work collaboratively. One possible solution is for students to learn by working on cases in multidisciplinary teams These multidisciplinary groups provide opportunities for collaboration and reflection that have the potential to greatly enhance student learning. Technology plays an important role in supporting such collaboration and reflection. In particular, this curriculum makes use of the Collaborative and Multimedia Interactive Learning Environment (CaMILE) to scaffold collaboration and reflection.",Papers

This program, the 'Dialogue Monitor', is the central part of a computer-assisted educational program, which acts as a simulated student and which collaborates with a human student in jointly solving this problem task. In this paper we will focus on crucial aspects of cooperative interaction in problem-solving learning situations, which we found hard to implement in our system.

The purpose is to develop the ability to think algorithmically and the ability to view things systematically. It is a simulation game of sumo wrestling - the traditional Japanese national sport. Students are supposed to program the actions of their own wrestler using a programming language so as 'to win matches against other wrestlers. To make the wrestler stronger, students are encouraged to analyze the chaotic situation systematically, devise better tactics, and incorporate them into the program. Such comprehensive problemsolving activities are comparable to the processes involved in software design. In addition, students commit to solving their own problems at their own responsibility. It is also comparable to the authentic activities of a software designer. In this sense, activities with AlgoArena can be regarded as a significant 'epitome' of authentic software design. Social setting for the learning environment is attributable to constraints embedded in the system of AlgoArena. For example, owing to the constraint of the game that a player needs opponents to fight with, students are encouraged to have matches with others, and social interaction among students is facilitated. In this way, a game situation is brought into the context of learning and produces a community of learners.",Papers

We believe the experiences from this study can provide insight on issues of importance to research on computer-supported collaborative learning in the classroom and to mathematics education. Our experiences echo those of many others on the effectiveness of collaborative use of computers, where the collaboration occurs through small groups of learners working at each computer. We also note the positive impact of connecting the computer activities with related large and small group classroom activities. We are excited by the success of these approaches in stimulating students to talk and write about mathematical concepts, and to view themselves as researchers exploring mathematical ideas.

Initial findings indicate that the CASENET tools and resources establish conditions for mutually beneficial professional conversations that encourage participation in a professional community. Such participation has been shown to support teachers as they attempt to change practice and implement reform. Six veteran social studies teachers and six student teachers engaged in discussions of teaching strategies and garnered mutual support for the risk-taking inherent in change. The multimedia cases provided a common context for discussion and the videoconference allowed for personalized, non-threatening contacts among teachers at vastly different stages in their careers, but faced with similar challenges.

This vision stems from a novel and evolving approach to collaborative learning that we are developing at the EduTech Institute. This approach is based on the following premises: that learning is facilitated by generative problem solving, collaborative work and use of multiple cases; that learning and skill acquisition need to be, and can be, scaffolded through software; and that a computer environment which integrates a shared and structured electronic workspace with a full variety of functionalities can effectively support all of the above. We describe this approach and the architecture of the corresponding computer environment. This environment is designed to serve three critical functions: provide a shared workspace for students, facilitate inter- and intra-group collaborative work, and make available the tools and resources that students need for problem solving and learning. The software components of the environment that have already been implemented are described. In the final section we frame ongoing and planned research and development efforts in terms of the characteristics desired of such an environment and ways of assessing its impact.",Papers

As a framework for describing differences in the students' activities between those who highly benefited and those who did not, ""Information-Access Characteristics (Perkins, 1993)"" was considered. Results showed: (1) that students who highly benefited from their activities in the database significantly more engaged in knowledge-transforming activities which are considered critical to high conceptual progress, and (2) that a system affordance which allowed students to conduct their joint writing activities significantly prompted such a transforming activities at a joint-space of their collaborative learning.",Papers

This approach differs from traditional instructional design in two ways. First, the program was intended to augment an existing activity sequence rather than serve as an independent environment separated from the students' regular classroom work. Second, it is considered to be bottom-up in the sense that its aim was to engage students in activities that were consistent with their provisional ways of knowing. The first section of this paper describes how the constructs of reification and distributed intelligences were combined with Freudenthal's three design heuristics to guide the development of the microworld.

Computers are useful in collaborative writing because repeated use of tutorials can help students learn problem-solving methods, allow students to share their work in a flexible manner suited to many classroom environments (K12 and college), and serve to give teachers a window into the thinking process of their students. The SEENMath software, developed through a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, comes with a tutorial in mathematical problem-solving (based on Polya's four-step heuristic) that allows students to accompany their writing with drawings, calculations or graphs. Students share their completed explorations of a problem with other students through a built-in bulletin board that allows peer review.

The approach was predicated on the assumption that students authentically construct knowledge from their experiences within a social context of peer influence. Reflective writing in the context of a public forum in which students were required to react to each other's writing engaged students in a process of critical thinking. They were required to maintain an electronic journal which consisted of weekly narratives (postings to a ""netnews group"") which consisted of reflections on classroom activities and related readings. Classroom activities included the use of a writing activity described as a Dyadic Essay Confrontation (DEC). Students were required to react to a randomly determined partner's reflections within one week after the initial reflection. A final narrative reflection was required to be submitted to the newsgroup detailing a summary analysis of the constructed knowledge they had determined was brought about through this process. Their reflections and reactions and summary/conclusions comprised a major product for inclusion in an electronic portfolio which was submitted at the end of the class. The techniques, as well as how this complex structure was implemented, and, how students responded· to the electronic medium are discussed. Using a rationale derived from the WAC community that stresses integration of the writing process across the curriculum, the conclusions focus on using CMC as an integral part of classroom instruction. A Postmodern and Constructivist theoretical orientation is used to explain the positive student responses to this complex of authentic instruction.",Papers

Emphasis is placed on blending synchronous and asynchronous technologies to facilitate sustained interaction and real-time application of concepts. Options contained within INSTRUCT include a hypermedia version of the Professional Standards for Classroom Teaching, links for connecting to on-line educational resources, the ability to attend synchronous meetings with other INSTRUCT users, opportunities to join in asynchronous discussions, and general access to the Internet. Three key research questions concerning this type of technology are discussed: The amount of face-to-face training required for teachers to become comfortable using INSTRUCT, the extent to which collaboration features of INSTRUCT must be formalized to ensure involvement by participants, and whether use of INSTRUCT can foster among teachers a sense of self-worth and community resulting in lasting change in practice.",Papers

The authors propose, as one possibility, the role of computer-based educational tools as supporters of a ""community of learners"". ""Community of learners"" is a community maintained by ""learners"" who are trying to establish their identities in a certain community of practice. It works as an interface to full participation in the community of practice. Both facilitating interactions among learners and making links between activities within the community of learners and practices in the real world are crucial for supporting the community of learners. As the first step to this goal, the authors focus on interaction-level support of the community of learners, and mention AlgoBlock, a tangible programming language developed by the authors, as an example of computer-based educational tools for facilitating interactions among learners.",Papers

This paper suggests that in today's workplace, computer science students must be adept at both technical as well as cooperative skills. Towards this end, we developed a computer supported cooperative problem solving envi- . ronment designed to teach undergraduate computer science majors how to elicit software requirements. We believe that requirements elicitation and cooperative skills are highly interrelated and, as such, can be taught more effectively through the use of a computer-supported cooperative environment. The environment encourages cooperative work, and yet provides instructors with the ability to monitor both individual and group performance. From our study, we found that students who used the computer-supported cooperative environment to elicit requirements performed better than those students who did the same task face-to-face.",Papers

Once the domain of technical experts and ""guru's, we are now told that computers are ""for the rest of us""[4]. However, usable software designs still mandate some specialized training in their use [3]. As computers become more prevalent in the workplace, individuals must both maintain their current level of productivity while learning new methods of performing tasks tey had previously done either manually or using a different computer software application. Software that minimizes learning time could be of substantial value to deadline pressured workers who must take advantage of advancing technologies but do not have access to special training. DesiL (Designing for Learnability) is a methodology for informing the design of microcomputer software, that may permit a designer to produce both usable and more easily learned software applications. This methodology is non-deterministic in that it does not make decisions for a designer, but rather informs a designer's options toward creating software that may be more easily learned by the end user.",Papers

Anchored instruction requires reevaluating classroom structure, communication dynamics, and the instructional artifacts used in the process. A major challenge for anchored instruction, and problem based learning curricula in general, is to help ensure that each student learns while also gaining the experience of working collaboratively. One possible solution involves integrating the computer as an active ""agent"" involved in the instructional process.

During reciprocal tutoring, two agents, where an agent is either a real student or a virtual learning companion simulated by the computer, interact and take turns for playing the roles of a tutor and a tutee.

Potential group members can identify learning advantages of participating in group work but also both anticipate and then experience problems which affect the performance of student groups. Students and staff at the University of Canberra have collaborated to design groupware support for student project teams. This paper discusses the types of activities involved in student group work, describes the kinds of software support that are being trialled to facilitate learning through group work activities, and summarises an evaluation procedure.",Papers

The resulting increased complexity in the social context in which the learning is occurring requires a more indepth understanding of the learning process. Collaborative learning is gaining in popularity but we still need to establish what is meant by it and gain insight into its process. This paper proposes an innovative analytical framework for viewing the collaborative process. It reports on a study with elementary school aged children working with LEGO/Logo and their evolving understanding of the scientific concept of mechanical advantage. It comes as little surprise that children learning collaboratively is not always as collaborative as one might have expected. In fact, in this study disagreements arose frequently. Some of the findings are reported and support the view that disagreements can be a legitimate form of collaboration.",Papers

In the present study, the principle of risky shift was constructively applied to 137 elementary students working with a computerized mathematics task to increase their academic risk-taking behavior. Results of the study show that the observed risky shift in the educational situation was most likely caused by the problem-solving information shared among group members. It is proposed that an integration of risk-taking and computer supported collaborative learning environment will benefit students' learning and cognitive development.",Papers

The system is implemented using the World Wide Web, and operates with any standard Web browser supporting forms. This paper describes the conceptual model for collaboration in CoNote, and discusses our experiences using the system in an introductory college computer science course. We have found that shared annotations of documents provide a richer communications forum than electronic media such as newsgroups, bulletin boards and email distribution lists. The central difference is that the documents provide a context for discussions, thereby enabling people to find relevant information more easily.",Papers

It is an example of case-based instruction, situated learning in the workplace forcing cognitive collaborative knowledge negotiation, conceptual change and development. The paper aims to contribute to the discussion of how computer based programs can be used in education in another way as an electronic book or a game of putting the right answers forward to the posed questions. The study concerns the training of 20 aspirant officers in justifying their judgemental shooting decisions in deadly force situations. Eight Officers interacted with an additional hypermedia learning environment FireProf. No difference between experimental and control group could be determined concerning the progress in technical and judgemental shooting, and teachers judgements about students' approach (verbal, moving, tactic and decision). However the arguments put forward by the experimental group in justifying their decisions in deadly force situations increased in contrast to the control group.",Papers

We suggest that computer systems should be designed to support collaborative learnability; to this end, we offer a number of collaborative learnability design principles. In particular, we emphasize that the prime objective should be user participation. We suggest some principles of collaborative visibility and highlight the importance of the demonstration in the sharing of skills. The various design principles are incorporated into a generic model for collaborative user support called MutualAid. A specific system based on this model is also described. This system uses multimedia demonstrations recorded by end users to support an interactive problem-solving forum and the development of a local database of computer-related practice.",Papers
