We discuss these issues by contrasting two different views of language and communication, one being a model developed by Clark and Brennan, the other being a situated action approach. Clark and Brennan’s model has gained substantial popularity in CSCL research. We develop our argument by presenting illustrative analyses of two data extracts concerned with the development of shared knowledge, the negotiation of goals and the conditional relevance of technological tools. We conclude that Clark and Brennan’s model retains a communication-as-transfer view of language and communication, and that a situated action approach is more suitable for grasping the complex dynamics of joint activity.",Long Papers

Systems that support learning in context and collaborative learning are increasingly being used to support performance and learning for school reform and business productivity. Similarly, many of the performance and learning outcomes that we care the most about, e.g., higher order thinking, problem solving, communication competencies, are understood as developing in the authentic activity of a community, such as a profession, a trade, or an academic discipline. Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a method for bringing the power of technology to support collaborative and contextual learning. This article argues that CSCL can be a framework for school reform, not just as a method of curriculum implementation, but also as a framework for enterprise-wide, process change. The article will also illustrate how cscl-type systems can facilitate schools becoming learning organizations, not just organizations that support learning.",Long Papers

Using scripts to divide the children’s commands typed into categories, we found that girls spend significantly more time than boys communicating with others in the CSCL environment. Analyzing the children’s level of programming achievement, we found that gender does not affect programming performance. Regression analysis shows that performance is correlated with prior programming experience and time on task. Boys are more likely than girls to have prior programming experience, and spend more time programming on average. We contrast these quantitative findings with our qualitative observations, and conclude that quantitative analysis has an important role to play in CSCL research. These results suggest that educators wishing to increase gender equity in technical skill should focus on strategies for fostering interest among girls.",Long Papers

We found that the narrower the channel, the less likely groups were to use relationship-focused leadership styles. We also found that for mixed-gender groups, lower levels of relationship-focused leadership led to poorer group performance on the cooperation task. The more autocratic task-focused leadership style was not inhibited by communication channel. Additional results are also given linking gender composition to choice of leadership style.

Systematic enquiry into educational interactions can yield understandings and insights about one of the fundamental relationships of all educational endeavours: between teaching and learning. The paper explores this relationship through analyses of teaching and learning in a networked collaborative learning environment using two new content analysis schemas. The first of these probes the social co-construction of knowledge in a collaborative online event by analysing the social, cognitive and metacognitive contributions to an online learning event. In the second schema the presence of teacher processes is investigated. Computer assisted qualitative data analysis is used for this.

In particular, it examines why the tutors’ aspirations of helping the students to collaborate were not met. It was found that students tended not to use the groupware, preferring other, self-developed support tools. Our study shows that the failure was multidetermined: there was a complex interacting set of factors including software use problems, systems integration issues, conflicting tutor/student perceptions of the value of using the groupware, and conflicts in each group’s view of how best to complete the course. There has been interest in using Activity Theory to approach multidimensional analysis in CSCL, but existing Activity Theory-based frameworks can be difficult to apply to instances of collaborative learning marked by conflict. To address this need, we use an Activity Theory-based analytic tool called the Activity Space. The tool is also used to show how multiple changes could be made to improve the potential for groupware to be used as intended.",Long Papers

CML models e-learning workflows with three major components: actors, data objects, and interaction networks. Actors are the diverse performers of actions, data objects are the semantically typed information units that are made available for exchange. Interaction networks are virtual networks constructed on top of whatever network ClassSync is running on, and dictate how information may flow through the ClassSync system (from actor to actor). Activities are the processes performed via these three components, in which actors create and consume data objects and exchange them over an interaction network.

In this paper, we describe the STEP environment for distributed problem-based learning (www.eSTEPweb.org), which represents one of many efforts to create a viable model for teacher education reform. Here, we describe our approach to creating a socio-technical infrastructure designed to help foster a knowledge-building community among preservice teachers, practicing teachers, and instructional staff. We highlight the online environment that supports student and staff coursework in the learning sciences component of a secondary teacher education curriculum.",Long Papers

We argue that self-regulation is one of the most critical components of reflective inquiry and present an empirical case of how the Progress Portfolio tool was designed to enable students to become self-regulated in their learning. Even though there is a rich literature on self-regulation, little has been written about group self-regulation in inquiry-based science. Preliminary results from a study with middle school students show that students do use the Progress Portfolio tool to engage in self-regulating cognitive activities, such as setting goals, planning, and monitoring their work.",Long Papers

However, online discussions are often less focused than necessary because learners lack skills in analysis, argumentation, and other rhetorical skills. Rhetorical skills can be scaffolded in online discussion boards by constraining the kinds of comments that learners can contribute to the discussion. We describe a system for imposing different discourse structures onto conversations in order to scaffold different forms of reasoning and some preliminary research findings.

Many different approaches to scaffolding techniques have been presented in a broad range of software tools. I discuss two mechanisms to explain how software tools can scaffold learners. Software tools can help structure the learning task, guiding learners through key components and supporting their planning and performance. In addition, tools can shape students’ performance and understanding of the task in terms of key disciplinary content and strategies, thereby problematizing this important content. While making the task more difficult in the short term, by forcing learners to address these ideas, such scaffolded tools make this work more productive opportunities for learning.",Long Papers

An aggregate statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the quality of reflective observations provided, and the number and quality of responsive messages received from other team members. Conversely, high responsive message senders were associated with low quality messages. Reflective communicators were theorized to occupy a distinctive niche in the team, both as a source of high quality reflective observations and who engaged in high frequency, bi-directional responsive communications. Based on these criteria an individual analysis of the data revealed 13 reflective communicators among the 32 participants. Reflective communicators tended to communicate with other reflective communicators in groups containing multiple reflective communicators and increased these communications over time.

It is based on regulation functions allowing the teacher to manage groups, to define the roles played by the participants in a group and to describe the way actions can be performed (by means of scenarios). This framework has been implemented as an independent software that can be plugged into any collaborative application.

We report on an intervention study in a middle school where the entire teaching staff engaged in a year-long effort to change their instructional practices by means of incorporating information and communication technologies in pilot curriculum units. The teachers set out to make pedagogical changes along two dimensions, from procedure-oriented drill to problem- and principle-oriented knowledge production, and from encapsulated classroom work to networked learning in partnerships between the school and organizations outside. They employed conceptual models to anchor their change efforts ‘upward’ in a long-term general vision. They also anchored their change efforts ‘downward’, in videotaped examples of classroom practice. Technical tools were subordinate to a pedagogical object. For the pedagogical object to gain momentum and become a true motive for the teachers, they needed to take expansive actions that moved them from myth-driven to object-driven discourse. These expansive actions were actions of redefining the students as capable, and consequently redefining a new model of teaching as possible.",Long Papers

Considerable public expenditure is being applied to the creation of on-line learning and on-line learner information services. These are seen as having a major role in stimulating learning in small businesses. The small business sector has traditionally proved reluctant to engage in structured programmes of employee development. While policy is finding application through significant spending on new infrastructure, insufficient attention is being paid to the ways in which those in the workplace learn and learn about learning. Drawing on research carried out in Scotland, this paper suggests that the development of ICT supported work-based learning will result in significant changes in learning relationships and in the sources from which learners seek support. The effective development of learning in small businesses is dependent on the radical changes in technology associated with ICT being matched by equally radical changes in the way that work-based learning is conceptualised and organised. In particular, the potential of new learning relationships must be recognised and taken fully into account in planning and implementing work-based learning programmes. While positive for learners and the businesses in which they work, the changes in roles and relationships which the adoption of this perspective will involve will challenge and are likely to marginalize traditional players in the learning market.",Long Papers

As a result, children who wish to collaborate using computers must adapt their interactions to the single-user paradigm most personal computers are based on. More recently, co-located groupware systems offering support for concurrent, multi-user interactions around a shared display have become technologically feasible. Unlike traditional groupware systems that provide multi-user interaction through the use of separate computers, these systems share the physical workspace, as well as the virtual workspace. These systems provide a unique mechanism through which children can interact with each other. However, ways to best utilize the technology in this manner has not been fully evaluated. This paper investigates how technological support for children’s synchronous interactions facilitates their collaborative activities. In particular, we examined whether a shared workspace facilitates the development of a shared understanding during a computer-based collaborative activity. We present a field study that observed pairs of children playing an educational game in several display configurations. The findings from this research suggest strengths and weaknesses of various types of support for synchronous interactions and discusses issues related to the design and development of more effective computer systems to support children’s face-toface interactions.",Long Papers

KidPad, a 2½D drawing package with zooming capabilities, was adapted for use with multiple mice and tangible interfaces. The first section of the paper focuses on a study carried out to evaluate the effect of multiple mice on children’s collaborative behaviour at a desktop computer. Positive effects of the use of two mice included symmetry of mouse use amongst pairs and a greater degree of engagement in the task. However a number of usability issues were identified when children attempted to collaborate, particular problems were faced when the shared control was taken away, and one of the users took control, for example, when navigating. Different types of working styles were also evident between the one mouse and two mice conditions. The second section of the paper describes a move away from the desktop computer towards room-based technologies. Tangible interfaces to KidPad were developed in order to facilitate shared control over actions such as navigation where difficulties had been identified in a desktop situation. The visibility of action is highlighted as a fundamental element in the support of collaboration on a larger scale. Finally, future work and the potential of these technologies in encouraging shareable co-present interaction in a real school context are briefly discussed.",Long Papers

Sam was designed to appear as a peer to preschool children, but to tell stories in a developmentally advanced way in order to model narrative skills important for literacy. Literacy learning - learning how to read and write, begins long before children enter school. One of the key skills to reading and writing is the ability to represent thoughts symbolically and share them in language with an audience who does not share the same background. Children learn and practice such important language skills in the informal setting of everyday storytelling with their peers and adults available around them. In particular, storytelling in a context of peer collaboration provides a perfect place where children not only learn language skills important for literacy, but also learn to be critical listeners of others' stories. Preliminary evaluation showed that by interacting with Sam, 5-year-old children's stories more closely resembled Sam’s linguistically advanced stories with more quoted speech and temporal and spatial expressions. In addition, the children listened to Sam's stories carefully, assisting her and giving suggestions on how to improve them. With Sam, children not only learned new linguistic behaviors that are important for literacy, but also to become critical listeners of other's stories.",Long Papers

Technologies afford opportunities to scaffold and extend the domains of inquiry, but successful adoption depends on their integration with classroom organization and practice. In elementary schools, small group and whole class activities dominate over solitary activity, and the effective use of traditional desktop computer systems has proven to be a difficult challenge for classroom teachers. Increasingly affordable large-format displays more naturally support small-group collaboration, but require careful activity design to maximize utility. We describe an activity design employing large displays that accommodates both the constraints of the classroom and the play experiences of children in support of observational science learning.",Long Papers

These are part of an ongoing research program, which is investigating the usefulness of the technological mediated collaborative problem solving for distance learning. Technological mediation consists of access to shared simulations and access to a variety of means of communication. The means of communication we have explored range from audio only contact to video mediated communication with or without eye contact. The motivating question behind this research program is ‘what is different when members of a problem-solving group are physically separated but technologically connected?’ The studies are set in the context of pairs of adults working with shared simulations of either physics or statistical experiments. The first set of studies investigated pairs working on a shared simulation of a physics experiment developed in SharedARK. The study compared remote technological mediated communication with communication that occurred during physical co-presence. There were no differences in performance, but the addition of computer mediated communication did influence the pattern of interaction. These experiments suggested that eye contact influenced problem solving. The second set of studies compared pairs and groups of threes and fours using a simulation of a statistic experiment developed in a system called Kansas. In these studies we compared learners with either video-mediated communication or audio only communication. The addition of the visual communication channel altered the pattern of interaction. The most recent study presents evidence that suggests eye contact facilitated conceptual understanding..",Long Papers

Effects of Content Schemes and Cooperation Scripts in Peer Teaching Settings,"Video-conferencing is expected to become increasingly important for tele-learning environments. In contrast to asynchronous, text-based computer-mediated communication, video-conferencing facilitates cooperation tasks that require highly frequent and continuous coordination. Typical kinds of such cooperation tasks are found in peer teaching settings. Despite the growing application of video-conferencing, only little is known about possibilities of enhancing collaboration in video-conferencing settings. This study investigates the effects of different types of support for cooperation on the learning outcomes of peer dyads in a video-conferencing scenario. The main research question is how cooperation scripts and content schemes enhance the students’ cognitive activities and foster the outcomes of cooperative learning. Two factors were varied experimentally: The content scheme (with/without) and the cooperation script (with/without). 86 university students of educational psychology participated in the study. Each student of a dyad received a text dealing with a psychological theory in the field of the nature-nurture-debate. The students’ tasks were (1) to teach their partners the relevant contents of their text and (2) to reflect ideas that went beyond the scope of the text. Results indicate that in particular the cooperation script enhances learning outcomes of collaborative knowledge construction.",Long Papers

We are interested to find out how, within a computer environment, students collaborate, how they use the different tools we offer and how this influences the quality of the final product. A custom-made computer-supported environment (TC3) was implemented that enables pairs of high school students to collaborate in writing an argumentative essay. The essay had to be convincing and based on authentic information sources. TC3, a groupware program, offers the students as task related and communicative tools: a shared text editor, a chat facility, access to relevant sources of information and a private notepad. Furthermore, some facilities or tools were offered that might promote collaboration on the task: access to the chat history, adaptability of the display layout, marking and searching in information sources and counting the number of words in the shared text. From our analyses we may conclude that the tools and resources the students use during collaborative writing seem to reflect the writing strategies they adhere to and that the use of these tools and resources in the different phases of the collaborative writing process is related to the argumentative quality of the final product. Future research will focus on the effects of adding tools for text planning and linearization to the TC3 environment on the coordination processes of collaborative writing.",Long Papers

The technical part of Livenotes is a collaborative whiteboard running on wireless handheld computers. We describe the system and the affordances we have developed for it to support the distributed dialogue model. We then examine the interactive dialogue that resulted from two classroom trials, using transcript captures, and analyze how users developed ways to navigate between pages, organize space on screens, determine whether the system was operational, and create social rapport.

Examples of these dialogues show dozens of turns (individual utterances by participants) in a single learning session. In contrast, measurements of interaction from computer-supported collaborative learning environments show that on-line dialogue looks much different, with an average of approximately one posting or less per student per week. Measurements of learning in these environments do suggest learning is occurring, but presumably, not based on the same kind of dialogue described in research on face-to-face collaboration. We explore explanations for how the learning is arising in CSCL environments based on the Vicarious Learning Project (Lee, Dineen, McKendree, & Mayes, 1999; McKendree, Stenning, Mayes, Lee, & Cox, 1998), but in the course of this explanation, two additional hypotheses emerge. We believe that some of the learning in CSCL environments occurs from the observation of the dialogue, the reflection induced by the potential of submitting, and in the interaction between the face-to-face and on-line environments.",Long Papers

Shared representations can significantly influence the processes of modeling and communication. In order to find the specific benefits of two different representations, we compare pairs working on a collaborative modeling task using a text based model representation with others using a graphical representation. The learners, secondary school students, used the modeling representation for two hours working on a task in the domain of physics. Results indicate that the two representations support different phases of the modeling process.",Long Papers

Authority, a major force in the classroom, gives certain people, objects, representations or ideas the power to affect thought and behavior and influences communication and interaction. Effective computer-supported collaborative learning requires students and teachers to change how they understand and assign authority. This paper describes two studies in which students’ perceptions of authority led to learning difficulties while they were engaged in collaborative learning. Students converged on either a representation or representational style that they believed was authoritative instead of basing their choice on how well the available representations communicated a concept. Methods to help students avoid such premature convergence are suggested.",Long Papers

The paper presents a principled approach to the design of problem-oriented, web-based learning at the university level. The principles include providing authentic contexts with multimedia, supporting collaborative knowledge construction, making thinking visible with dynamic visualization, quick access to content resources via Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and flexible support by tele-tutoring. These principles are used in the Munich Net-based Learning In Computer Science (MUNICS) learning environment, which is designed to support students of computer science to apply their factual knowledge from the lectures to complex real-world problems. For example, students can model the knowledge management in an educational organization with a graphical simulation tool. Some more general findings from a formative evaluation study with the MUNICS prototype are reported and discussed. E.g., the students’ ignorance of the additional content resources is discussed in the light of the well-known finding of insufficient use of help systems in software applications.",Short Papers

This paper addresses the application part of transfer. For novice problem solvers, applying cases can be a difficult task. Case-based Reasoning (Kolodner, 1993; Schank, 1982) makes some suggestions for promoting good case application. Learning By Design (LBD) (Kolodner et al., 1998) builds on case-based reasoning and constructivist approaches to learning as well as classroom practices from problem based learning and communities of learners, to support both collaborative learning and learning from hands-on activities (Kolodner & Nagel, 1999). The software component to LBD, SMILE (Supportive Multi-User Interactive Learning Environment), was designed to promote the kinds of reflection that case-based reasoning suggests are needed to learn from experience. Among other tools, SMILE consisted of a Case Authoring Tool, whose role was to scaffold student’s reading of an expert case such that they could write it up to present to the rest of the class. Although this tool did approach students’ understanding of an expert case, it did not approach students’ application of that case to their challenge. This paper reports on the Case Application Tool Suite (CATS), which supports four stages of case application – case interpretation, matching, solution application, and solution assessment. This tool suite builds on our experiences with scaffolding design discussions (with the Design Discussion Area (DDA)) and scaffolds both case application and collaborative learning in a project-based environment.",Short Papers

The objective of this framework is to help tutors achieve better results from group discussions and improve knowledge transfer among the participants. The overall idea is to organize the group discussion in an argumentation tree and involve the participants in successive discussion activities. The coordination of the discussion is made by a set of intelligent mechanisms which reason over the discussion and propose new interactions among the participants. AMANDA advances the discussion by generating progressive discussion cycles until a desired set of target conditions are observed. At each discussion cycle, the system redistributes discussion tasks among the participants to ensure a desired degree of agreement and participation among them. In this short paper we describe the underlying coordination principles and the use of knowledge models for producing natural language questions.",Short Papers

The SNS environment may be installed locally for the learning community whether that is a school building, school district or consortium of teachers or schools collaborating on implementing a cross schools project. SNS is being provided for free, has an Application Programming Interface (API) so others can develop applications for it, and is open source so that everyone can participate in enhancing and supporting it. SNS includes tools such as secure login, well-defined user roles and group types, file system, calendar & task manager, chat & discussion boards, notes & document creator, and homework notification. The system’s strength and potential for longevity lie in its Open Source (GNU Public License) development model, object and process oriented operating environment, and a robust application programming interface (API).

Knowledge building discourse in the Fle2 type of systems usually leads to gradual accumulation of notes. We have found that users experience difficulties to get an overall picture of the knowledge produced and synthesize its advancement. By providing means for the participants to highlight key ideas, that they find particularly useful, the CoDi tool was designed to facilitate collective management of knowledge and inquiry and provide various visual representations of the database. We report results of a pilot experiment carried out with the CoDi prototype that appears to be a promising tool. However there are certain open questions concerning what are the social and pedagogical effects of highlighting ideas in different educational setting, how highlighting should be organized so that it would provide strongest support of knowledge advancement, and whether the results should always be shared not only by tutors but also by students. Regardless of the challenges, the development of the CoDi tool appears to open up an interesting line of inquiry that we would like to share with the CSCL community.",Short Papers

Ideally, learning environments allow novices to work together to achieve convergence of correct understanding, without constant support from experts. In order to achieve this, software designers need to investigate properties of the environment that support convergence. One of these properties is multiple linked representations (MLRs). In this paper, I describe AudioExplorer, a learning environment where students, working in pairs, explore the physics of music. AudioExplorer is remarkable in its use of many linked representations; thus, it is a good environment to research the role of MLRs in the convergence process.",Short Papers

Less attention has been given to how the participants themselves see collaborative patterns and trends. Towards that end, we interviewed 131 fourth and fifth-grade elementary students at the end of four different ten week-long collaborative software design projects and asked them to describe the type of help they had either given to or received from team members and other students in their class. Technical help with programming problems was by far the most prominent type of help given or received. The frequency of helping interactions not only increased over the course of two design projects but also became more varied. Distribution of helping interactions became only more equitable in a second design project. The discussion addresses methodological issues in using students’ perceptions of helping interactions in social network analysis, the nature of students’ social resources, the impact of experience, and issues of gender equity in computer-supported collaborative learning.",Short Papers

Efficient collaboration is shown to depend strongly on the quality of the coordination activities. A first experiment investigated the effects of different technical realizations of computer-mediated collaboration on the coordination of activities. It revealed that especially a well-balanced sequence of phases of joint work and individual working phases was central for the quality of the problem-solving process. The goal of a second experiment was to test the effectiveness of promoting this coordination by vicarious learning from an exemplary computer-mediated collaboration. By combining two strands of research – studies on worked-out examples and work on vicarious learning from dialogue and discourse – we show a new and theoretically well-founded way to strengthen collaborative competence.,Short Papers

Collaborative review and assessment involves the student, their peers and tutor in thoughtful and critical examination of each student’s course work. The process involves two stages: review and discussion of the student’s work with a view to bringing different critical yet supportive perspectives to the work. This is followed by the use of two sets of criteria to make judgements on the student’s work: one set provided by the student, the other by the tutor. The purpose of collaborative assessment is to foster a learning approach to assessment and to develop a shared power relationship with students. From analysis of face to face interviews, examination of e-learning discussions and student completed questionnaires, a set of analytic categories was developed describing the learners’ experiences of collaborative assessment. The paper focuses on analysing and discussing these categories of experience. The research shows that collaborative e-learning assessment helps students move away from dependence on lecturers as the only or major source of judgement about the quality of learning. Students develop skill and know how about self and peer assessment and see themselves as competent in making judgements about their own and each other’s work, which are good lifelong learning skills.",Short Papers

Our study focused on survey and case study data that SRI International collected as part of its ongoing evaluation of GLOBE (Means et al., 2001). We hypothesized: (1) teachers who are active in implementing an inquiry-based science program more frequently employ collaboration for cognitively complex activities than teachers who are less active implementers; (2) active teachers use collaboration more over time; and, (3) active GLOBE teachers who organize learning by collaborative groups perceive greater learning benefits than active teachers who rarely used collaboration. Our study confirmed that active teachers of an inquiry-based science program use collaboration more over time, but they are no more likely than less active teachers to see collaboration as beneficial to student learning. We also found that active teachers were likely to use collaborative small groups primarily to support data collection and reporting tasks to make them fit better into the classroom schedule than for data analysis and interpretation.",Short Papers

Two user studies were conducted. The first suggests that paired children of different SES use different social and linguistic strategies to establish cohesion and that purely syntactic measures of narrative coherence are not sensitive enough to describe children’s collaborative language play. A second pilot study investigated how groups of children used TellTale. Although results are not conclusive, TellTale also seems to be an engaging interface for group authorship.",Short Papers

The current design of LeTUS inquiry-based, technology embedded science curriculum presumes a facility with, and strategic use of literacies on the part of students who enact the curriculum. Here literacy means two things: deriving meaning from patterns in knowledge domains like science and facility with different information forms. We use teacher interviews and on-line discussions to expose presumptive literacies in design and learners' literacy challenges and offer suggestions that teacher modifications to these units can inform future design to support literacy in science.",Short Papers

The hypothesis underlying this work states that regulation of the interaction and regulation of the task are closely related mechanisms and that their co-occurrence facilitates coordination. These assumptions are tested experimentally with a traffic simulator. The results show that co-occurrence of task and interaction regulation allows quicker solving of the problem, thus better performance. The experimental treatment aims at observing the effects of interaction meters on the accuracy of subjects’ estimation of their participation.

Supporting mutual understanding is a main challenge of CSCL research. We explore how this may happen in a continuous 3D space (VRML). Our first hypothesis was that the proximity of the emitter to the referred object clarifies the referential context. Our second hypothesis stated that the receiver uses gaze awareness in order to guess which object the emitter refers to. The experiment results confirmed the first hypothesis, surprisingly rejected the second hypothesis and reveal complex interactions between the two.",Short Papers

Prior to implementing a webtank for BEACON, I initiated collaboration with the SETI Institute on their development of a high school integrated science curriculum (astronomy, geology, biology, and the evolution of technology) where students explore how the concept of evolution underpins and integrates these disciplines. Curriculum requirements for the final Evolution of Technology module provided an opportunity to develop, pilot, and test a self-organizing collaborative web environment, or webtank, to be later adapted, augmented, and extended to support BEACON.

The lesson design in the second year was revised by providing students with cognitive scaffolds so that they could more articulately discuss their thoughts as objects.

These four contributions to CSCL are inter-related. The notion of collaborative knowledge building defines a useful paradigm for conceptualizing learning as social practice. The social interactions and knowledge management activities in which shared knowledge is constructed can be analyzed as the result of interweaving group and personal conversational perspectives. In general, collaborative interaction is mediated by artifacts: sometimes only by transitory artifacts like spoken words or gestures, but increasingly by physical or digital artifacts and media. Empirical studies of collaborative knowledge building employing micro-ethnographic analysis of speech, gesture, artifacts and media can make the details of these collaboration interactions visible, highlighting the interplay of perspectives and artifacts in the trans-personal construction of knowledge. A theoretical framework incorporating models of knowledge building, perspectives and artifacts – and grounded in empirical analysis of collaborative interaction – can guide the design of computer-based artifacts and media as support for collaborative learning with appropriate, elaborated and unified conceptualizations.",Long Papers

The online discourse between 46 members, using First Class, formed the basis for this study. Social Network Analysis and content analysis were used to analyze the data. The results show that the interaction patterns between the members are rather centralized and that the network is relatively dense. Most of the members are involved within the discourse but person to person communication is still rather high. Content analysis revealed that discourse is focused on sharing and comparing information.",Short Papers

Field tests of the system reveal that; 1. The Question-Answer function reconfigures social relationships in the classroom and thus creates a foundation for collaborative learning, 2. The Question-Answer function creates a field of informal talk, 3. The SOUTO system provides a foundation on which both formal and informal talks are constituted and woven together, and thus, transition between them is enabled. Based on these findings, we suggest that educational systems should be designed as mediators that hybridize school-like activities and non-school-like activities.",Short Papers

Distributed collaborative learning is commonly placed in hybrid settings, where the participants engage in computer-mediated communication as part of some sort of institutionalized education. There are thus some inherent issues, both new and old, that need to be taken into consideration when doing ethnography in distributed learning environments. Addressing these issues, we emphasize the role of technology and information infrastructure and how this might impact the learning situation, but also how it can be used as a resource in ethnographic research. In addition, we discuss how to observe, participate and immerse oneself in these technologically dense environments. This includes presenting and exploring concepts such as virtual observations and technological immersion, but also discussing more common topics like access and the role of the researcher. Another important aspect of ethnographic studies is the devotion to an empirical grounding of the research, which again presents methodological challenges when studying students working online and in distributed settings.",Short Papers

The interns use an application designed to foster a dialectical record of their experiences and differences of opinion about how to understand those experiences. We use discourse analysis to explore the students' presuppositions about good communication in the online text. We describe how students’ presuppositions that good communication is “open and honest” often conflicts with their experience of superior-subordinate relationships. We suggest that conflicts with presuppositions can be used to facilitate further reflective learning and to shape the online dialogue.,Short Papers

The goal of the study was to investigate how the students used a set of groupware tools to coordinate learning activities. We have used concepts from collaborative telelearning and coordination mechanisms (Schmidt & Simone, 1996) as analytic framework. Our findings indicate that students coordinate many activities by implicit, locally adopted resources instead of fully developed mechanisms. Three implicit resources were identified and named (no initial discussion, asymmetry of knowledge, and different expectations). These resources were not associated with any specific groupware features, but referred to the students’ background knowledge and subjective interpretation. We end the paper by suggesting how implicit resources in distributed learning environments can play a role similar to how non-verbal cues – such as gesture and facial expression – play a role in face-to-face interaction, but without imitating human body language.",Short Papers

The gap between the goal to work efficiently and the need to increase qualification and skills is even wider in organizations which operate in knowledge-intensive markets and where responsibility and autonomy characterize the work style of geographically distributed workers (“Virtual Organizations”). Classical learning methods have to be complemented by a lightweight knowledge-sharing infrastructure (“knowledge logistics”). In this contribution we describe a method of introduction of knowledge logistics which reflects that gap and offers support for self-organized settings for learning at work. We present our approach by describing the case of the field service of a German health insurance company.,Short Papers

In collaborative design, the knowledge to understand, frame, and resolve problems does not exist, but is constructed and evolved during the process, exploiting the power of “symmetry of ignorance” and “breakdowns.” From this perspective, access to existing information and knowledge (often seen as the major advance of new media) is a very limiting concept. To illustrate this theoretical approach towards collaborative learning, the participants in this interactive event will engage in collaborative design activities supported by the Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory (EDC). The EDC merges physical interaction, handheld devices, simulations, end-user modifiability, and evolving web spaces to support a) the integration of problem framing and problem solving, b) the creation of shared understanding articulated as externalizations, and c) computer-supported learning among stakeholders. We will design the interactive event such that the participants will form a community of interest (defined by their collective concern with the resolution of a design problem) as they take on the roles of stakeholders from various communities of practice (such as city planners, transportation designers, and citizens). The event will illustrate the possibilities and limitations of the EDC for providing unique and innovative computer support for collaborative learning.",Interactive Events

Participants will meet developers and users of the wide variety of worlds in the Activeworlds Educational Universe (AWEDU) and will become acquainted with projects under development in such environments as Adobe Atmosphere. The Activeworlds platform is a modular 3D environment in which all content is developed online in realtime. This facilitates distributed group collaboration across geographical distances. Projects will demonstrate various ways that bridges are being built between age groups, languages and cultures in educational virtual worlds. All projects will show how the collaborative construction of social artifacts, peer-to-peer activities and knowledge building define the learning experience. We will tour art, science, language learning, and information science worlds and meet some of their inhabitants (embodied and visible to each other as “avatars”). The program will combine a projected presentation, an overview of the technology and introduction to the projects, with the opportunity to interact with the worlds and their developers on their own through a bank of desktops.",Interactive Events

In this paper we describe this issue by identifying two collaboration patterns that are manifested in the students’ dialogues and actions in a particular 3D learning environment. The theoretical framework is found within socio-cultural perspectives that view learning as socially and culturally constructed and of which artefacts are considered as inseparable from human activity. In agreement with the intellectual heritage, the collaboration patterns are identified through analyses of various extracts of dialogues and actions taken place between the students and how these extracts are operationalised by available artefacts. Interaction analysis constitutes the analytic tool.",Long Papers

Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the center of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called “Object-oriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF)” is presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the center of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are ‘owned’ by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development. OCAF is based on both actions and dialogues of actors, providing qualitative as well as quantitative indicators of collaboration and solution quality. The paper presents first the framework notation. Examples of its use in analysis of distance groups and face-to-face collaborative activities are provided next, followed by the dimensions of the framework supported analysis for teachers and researchers. Web-based tools supporting the OCAF approach are also presented.",Long Papers
