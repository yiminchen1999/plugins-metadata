      Abstract: We have designed and developed technologies to make it
      simpler for teachers and students to take educational advantage of the
      WWW for collaborative project-based learning. Recognizing that
      technologies alone are insufficient to effect educational change, we have
      also directed considerable effort toward working with teachers to construct
      principled understanding of what supports are required to make effective
      use of our technologies­a "technology of use." This paper describes the
      technology we have provided for teachers to support collaborative project-
      based learning, and through examples of one teacher's experiences with
      three Zebu projects we illustrate the needs and challenges in supporting
      more effective use. Building on what we have learned about supporting
      teachers in designing, planning, and implementing project structures that
      will support students in engaging in collaborative project-based learning,
      we have been working towards the design of a technology of use. This
      technology of use includes a representational scheme for helping teachers
      to portray, analyze, plan, design, share, and implement collaborative
      projects.

Introduction

The Internet and WWW are being used more and more frequently in classroom settings
for education (Becker, 1999). However, few teachers are using the Internet and WWW
for student projects beyond finding information­communicating with others, publishing
work, or collaborating on projects (Becker, 1999). We have been working for several
years on designing and developing technologies to make it simpler for teachers and
students to use the WWW for collaborative project-based learning. This work has been
based on the premise that conventional Internet technologies are inadequate for
supporting the kinds of knowledge processes necessary for students to take full
educational advantage of the WWW in project-based learning (Ward & Tiessen, 1997a;
Ward & Tiessen, 1997b; Ward & Tiessen, 1999), to support the processes which we
believe are critical for collaborative project-based learning within a community of
learners.
Recognizing that technologies alone are insufficient to effect educational change, we
have also directed considerable effort toward working with teachers who use our
technologies to understand what efforts are required to make effective use of the
technologies­a "technology of use" (Scardamalia, 1994). Scardamalia defines technology
of use as "a technology that derives from scientifically guided experimentation in the use
of new computer-based tools, resources, and environments to maximize educational
outcomes," and claims that developing technologies of use is essential if technologies are
to have positive effects for education. We suggest that it is also critical to develop such
technologies of use to address issues of scalability and replication for widespread
adoption of educational technologies. A technology of use would not be a simple pattern
or recipe to be repeated, but a principled approach to understanding, communicating, and
designing effective uses of a technology, which would support a community of teachers
in addressing their challenges in applying a technology to solve educational problems.

This paper describes the technological supports we have provided for teachers to support
collaborative project-based learning, and through examples of one teacher's experiences
with three projects we illustrate the needs and challenges in supporting more effective
use. We describe a simple representational tool which we have created to support the
evolution of a technology of use for designing and implementing effective online
projects.

Support for the Processes of Collaborative Project-Based Learning

We have developed a technology designed to provide support for the group
communication and knowledge processes which we believe are critical for collaborative
project-based learning within a learning community:

   ·  engaging in research and adding intellectual value to existing information
      resources. This implies a shift from students acting as passive recipients of
      knowledge presented to them, to students actively engaging in sense-making and
      knowledge construction activities. By purposefully using information resources to
      construct answers to their own questions and achieve their own learning goals,
      students move beyond "knowledge reproduction" to "knowledge building"
      (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1993) Within a community of learners, the shared
      representations that students create of the knowledge they are building, inherently
      add intellectual value to the original information resources (Brown et al., 1993).
   ·  sharing information and communicating to coordinate activities and to
      collaborate in building communal knowledge. Within a community of learners,
      the focus is on the construction of knowledge representations and the learning that
      results from this construction. There will naturally be a variety of group processes
      at work as the community works to construct knowledge together (Brown et al.,
      1993; Rogoff, Matusov, & White, 1996). Communication­the sharing of
      information­creates mutual understanding and shared knowledge (Dix, 1994;
      Schrage, 1990). Cooperation­which requires communication­is the process of
      working together toward some shared purpose, generally the construction of some
      shared artifact (Dix, 1994). Collaboration is the process of creating new
      knowledge and involves communication through a shared artifact for the sake of
      creating new understanding that the participants could not have achieved on their
      own (Schrage, 1990). All three of these processes­communication, cooperation,
      and collaboration­involve learning. In communication, it is the learning
      associated with developing shared understanding with others. In cooperation,
      students learn as they communicate to work together toward some shared purpose.
      In collaboration, learning results from the social construction of knowledge.
   ·  engaging in sustained progressive inquiry. A characteristic of a learning
      community is that it engages in ongoing discourse. Such a discourse involves the
      exchange of ideas but, more importantly, building on the ideas and knowledge
      within the community (Bereiter, 1994). Within the classroom (or other
      educational context), such a discourse requires that students be engaged in
      sustained activities, that is, working on problems and goals that require substantial
      time and collective efforts to address. As part of these efforts, students must build
      on their own work and that of their peers to progressively advance their individual
      and group knowledge as they work on these problems and goals (Rogoff et al.,
      1996; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1989; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1996).

In the design of Zebu, our groupware technology, we have attempted to build specific
supports for these knowledge processes as well as tools for teachers to support and
scaffold student work within an integrated environment. Student work is automatically
organized into group projects in which whole classes or several classes can participate.
Through the project structure, students' work is automatically shared and students have
access to each other's work in progress throughout the duration of a project. Students'
work involves the construction of pages of multimedia objects, including text, graphics,
sound, video, and links. Collaboration between students is supported through the co-
construction of these pages. Within pages and projects, text-based discussions can be
embedded to support communication. Additional tools (reference collections and
galleries) for collecting, organizing, and sharing multimedia and information resources
support research activities and information sharing. The ability to access and link to each
other's work, makes it possible for students to use the contributions of other students to
progressively build representations and artifacts within the project.

The processes involved in collaborative project-based learning can be supported and
facilitated by the teacher who can structure the project space by setting up learning
activities to achieve particular educational goals. The software itself does not provide
scaffolding, but rather, makes it easy for teachers to provide scaffolding for students in
several ways:

   ·  Teachers can provide students with templates with which to create their own
      pages. Hence, students are not facing a blank page when starting their work. For
      example, if students are researching and writing about different animal species,
      the teacher can provide students with some structure of the appropriate
      multimedia objects that should be included in the students' work. The teacher can
      make this structure quite rigid and not allow students to change it, or keep it quite
      flexible and allow students to change different object attributes such as labels,
      media types, and content. The teacher may choose to initially provide a great deal
      of structure within templates and then gradually decrease the amount of structure
      and give students more flexibility.
   ·  When teachers create templates for their students, they can provide some
      scaffolding within the objects themselves to help students construct better
      representations. For example, if students are to write an explanation of a process,
      the teacher can provide them with some description of how to write a good
      explanation. Again, teachers can provide as much or as little of this support as
      they want.
   ·  Teachers can scaffold communication between students. At one level,
      communication is facilitated through the shared project structure. When students
      contribute pages which they have constructed from teacher-created templates, the
      template structure acts as the means by which the teacher scaffolds how students
      communicate their work to each other. Another way in which the teacher can
      scaffold and support communication between students is through discussions. The
      teacher can set up discussions for students to brainstorm, answer questions, solve
      problems, or coordinate activities. The teacher may even provide specific
      guidelines for appropriate student interactions within these discussions.
   ·  Teachers can provide scaffolding for students' use of information resources. Using
      reference collections, teachers can provide students with information resources to
      help students in their own investigations. Links to reference collections can be
      embedded in pages and templates, making it easy for teachers to provide specific
      information resources for students' activities. As students become more proficient
      in working with and finding information, teachers can turn this work over to
      students who can use these same tools.
   ·  Teachers can provide the support needed to sustain student inquiry and help it to
      progress. While the project structure makes it possible for students to have
      ongoing access to each other's work, it is up to the teacher to support students in
      building on their collective work. This is done by designing learning activities
      within the project that help students to make substantial individual and group
      contributions to whole group goals, are rich enough to sustain student engagement
      over an extended period of time, and are interrelated so that students have reason
      to and can benefit from looking at and building on the work of their peers.

Support for Teachers

Despite the supports which have been provided within the software, our experience has
been that students do not necessarily engage in these knowledge processes and teachers
do not necessarily know how to take advantage of the software to support and facilitate
student engagement in these processes. It has been helpful to examine how the software
has been used with various levels of support for the teacher, to see where problems lie
that make it difficult for teachers and students to use it to its full potential. As an
example, we describe here one grade seven teacher and her students' use of Zebu for
three projects over one school year.
First Project

The first Zebu project completed by this teacher and her students was called "Space
Mysteries." The teacher structured the project with three learning activities: research
about a planet, unmanned space travel, and manned space travel. For each of these
activities, the teacher created a template to guide students' research. The templates
contained minimal structure: for example, the planet research template provided objects
for students to include information about the planet, a picture of the planet, a comparison
of the planet to the next closest planet, a reference collection link for students to specify
their sources of information, and a discussion about what would be required for humans
to inhabit the planet. Within the templates, the teacher provided minimal guidance to
students: for example, "Describe the characteristics of this planet" was the guidance
provided for students to describe the planet. The teacher did not provide students with
any information or multimedia resources within the project. In implementing the project,
the teacher did not specify any structure for how students were to work together within
the project using these templates, but simply that students were to begin with planet
research. In examining the resulting project artifacts, there is little evidence that students
did more than share their work with each other. Students began the project by using the
planet research template to create their own page about a particular planet. Most of the
content created by students consisted of facts about the planets copied from books. Some
students completed their planet research and also created their own pages about
unmanned and manned space travel. As a result, the project contained a large number of
pages about the planets, many of them redundant, as well as several redundant pages
about space travel. Hence, while there was communication of students' research to each
other through the automatic sharing within the project structure, there was little or no
group effort invested in constructing the overall project. There is evidence that the
students looked at each other's pages: students made some contributions to discussions
within each other's pages. However, because of the way in which the students created
pages within the project, the same discussion question was duplicated in each student's
page. The students used the discussions to respond and give feedback to the authors of
the pages rather than discuss the given question.

Second Project

The second project in which this teacher and students participated was a project about
endangered species. This project was created for the teacher and her students and was set
up for them to participate with another teacher and students at a distant site. The project
had been designed to involve students in a variety of interrelated activities including
researching species, researching habitats, investigating reasons for endangerment, and
developing potential solutions and plans of action. As well, the project was designed to
have students work together using a variety of participant structures including
individuals, pairs, small groups, and the whole group, with some groups comprised of
students from both sites. The project provided students with several templates from
which to generate their own pages, pages to support the whole group activities, and
reference collections for students to find information to help them in their research and
investigations. The project had been designed for the activities to build on each other:
students were to work in pairs to research different plant and animal species in their own
region, leading to small group investigations about the regional habitats in which these
species live and interact, and leading ultimately to whole group and small group activities
about understanding reasons for endangerment common to the two regions. An additional
"progress" template was provided for students to monitor and report on their own
learning throughout the duration of the project. Unfortunately, in implementing the
project, the teacher did not coordinate the students or the activities to be used as
designed. The intention was that a variety of endangered species from the local region
would be specified and pairs of students would take responsibility for researching one of
these species. Instead, students each started their own progress page and their own page
on an animal species from somewhere in the world. As a result, the project contained a
huge number of pages about animal species from around the world, some of which were
redundant. This made it difficult to progress to the next level of the project (i.e.,
researching habitats), as there were pages about only animal species and there was no
common set of habitats amongst the species on which to base the next activity within the
project. Neither class completed any further activities within the project.

Third Project

For the third project, we spent time with the teacher planning the project activities as well
as how students would participate in the activities. This project, which focused on Pacific
Coast ecosystems, engaged students in similar types of research activities as the first two
projects, and also involved students in working together in different group structures on
multiple interrelated activities. Several project pages were designed specifically to
support these group activities. A project overview page presented students with the
curriculum outcomes for the project, some contextual information about the project, a
graphical organizer of the different types of coastal ecosystems, and a discussion for
students to ask and answer questions about the project. A set of small group pages were
set up for groups of students to work together on researching one of the coastal
ecosystems. Within these pages, a structure of multimedia objects corresponding to
curricular outcomes was provided to the students. Additional guidance was provided for
each of the objects. For example, in the object in which students were to "identify
chemical reactions that are important in the environment", additional guidance, "These
may include the effects of the following on the ecosystem: oxygen, carbon dioxide,
solubility, photosynthesis..." was provided to the students. A final page also supported a
whole class activity in which students were presented a food web and asked to compare it
to the food chains from each of the different coastal ecosystems by looking at the food
chains created by students in the corresponding pages. A reference collection with a
variety of information sources was provided to help students in their research. A link to
this reference collection was included in the student pages, as a well as a link for students
to create their own reference collection. In implementing the project, the teacher split the
class into groups and assigned each group to work on one of the ecosystems. Students
used the overview page to post questions and respond to questions from other members
of the class. The small groups of students worked together to construct their pages on the
different coastal ecosystems. Within these pages, they included textual and graphical
representations of their work. Most of the groups also constructed reference collections of
the information resources they collected and used in their research. As well, some
students participated in the final group page in comparing their food webs, although the
class ran out of time to complete this activity. The project contents show a fairly
complete body of student-generated work centered around understanding of different
aspects of coastal ecosystems.

Summary

Within these three examples, there were different levels of support provided to the
teacher and different levels of success in how students were able to engage in the
knowledge processes of collaborative project-based learning as described above. In the
first example, there was essentially no support to help the teacher effectively design and
implement the project activities. While students were engaged in some research and
shared their work, there is little evidence that they were engaged in adding intellectual
value to existing resources, collaboration, or sustained progressive inquiry. In the second
example, the learning activities had been designed for the teacher, but little support was
provided to the teacher in effectively implementing the activities. Without any assistance,
it seems that the teacher was unable to provide the students with the necessary support to
advance the project beyond the initial research and sharing of information about different
species. With the last project, support was provided to the teacher to plan, design and
implement the project, and we saw more evidence of students participating in the
knowledge processes of collaborative project-based learning (as described above).
Students were engaged in research; however, rather than simply copying facts and
information, they worked together in their groups to organize and synthesize the
information according to prescribed learning outcomes. During the course of the project,
students shared their work with other groups, worked together within their groups, and
worked together as a whole group. The whole group activities gave students the
opportunity to see and build on the interrelationships between their small group work.

Technology of Use for Collaborative Project-Based Learning

From our experience, teachers can learn to use the functions and features of Zebu with
little assistance. However, as seen in these examples (and others), teachers do not
necessarily have the understanding or ability to effectively use the technology to design
and support effective collaborative projects. Teachers often require scaffolding and
support to develop their abilities to design, develop, and implement online collaborative
projects that will engage students in the knowledge processes described above. Through
our work with teachers and students, we have been developing a better understanding of
the type of support that teachers require. We have designed new technical supports to
address some of the problems which we have observed in classroom use of Zebu. We
have also been working on developing "technologies of use" for helping teachers to
design, build, and implement project structures which will take better educational
advantage of our technologies. Clearly, it is impossible to provide individualized support
to more than a handful of teachers, and we must look to alternative ways to address the
problem of supporting them. By working with teachers to develop a technology of use for
our software technologies, we hope to support a community of teachers in which the
discourse further advances the educational use of our software technologies.
From the initial attempts of many teachers to build project structures, it is evident that
they do not have difficulty in conceiving of single project activities, or even several
single project activities; this is somewhat analogous to conceiving of and designing
lessons. The difficulty seems to lie more in building interrelated, progressive activities
and to support effective group processes (communication, cooperation, collaboration)
between students as they work on these activities. This is the problem of conceiving of
and designing entire project plans. Just as the lesson plan has become a tool for teachers
to conceive, design, and share lessons, we believe that teachers need a tool for conceiving
of, designing, and sharing entire projects. In the design of a technology of use for
designing, planning, and implementing project structures that will support students in
engaging in collaborative project-based learning, two of the questions we have tried to
address are:

   ·  how do we help teachers to (understand how to) make effective use of a
      variety of appropriate participant structures within collaborative projects?
      We believe that this is important to facilitate the authentic sharing and
      communication between students necessary for sustaining progressive inquiry. As
      well, using a variety of participant structures within a project gives students the
      opportunity to take on individual and group responsibilities for their own learning
      and the learning of the whole group.
   ·  how do we help teachers to (understand how to) build sets of interrelated
      learning activities that will engage students in sustained progressive inquiry?
      At the heart of sustained progressive inquiry is the notion that the work of the
      group advances. Hence, students need to have the opportunity to build on their
      own work and that of their peers. The project provides a means for students to
      have access to each other's work, but activities within the project need to build
      upon each other if students are to have reason to use each other's work.

Building on what teachers seem comfortable with, our starting point in designing a
technology of use has been the single learning activity structure as the building block for
larger project structures. In building a technology of use, we have been working on ways
for teachers to construct activity structures from activity components that correspond to
curriculum outcomes (this will not be addressed in this paper). Part of the process of
designing activity structures is deciding the most appropriate participant structure for the
activity. To address the first question, we have decomposed participant structures into
individual, pair, small group, and whole group structures, and provided a simple
representational scheme for teachers to specify a participant structure for individual
learning activities which they are designing (see Figure 1). By specifying a participant
structure to correspond to an activity component, consideration can be given to the most
effective type of group process for achieving the learning goal of the activity.
                       Figure 1. Participant Structures

To address the second question, we have introduced the notion of activity transitions to
help teachers consider how to build interrelationships between single learning activities
and the participant structures these learning activities employ. These activity transitions
include join, split, recombine, rotate, and regroup, and we have provided a simple
representational scheme for these as well (see Figure 2). By specifying activity transitions
between activities, attention can be given to the relationship between consecutive
learning activities. For example, joining can be a way for students to bring unique work
done in smaller groups to solving a problem within a larger group. As another example,
splitting can be a way of distributing a set of problems or issues identified within a larger
group to be investigated by different smaller groups. For these transitions to make sense,
the consecutive activity structures need to be related in a way which supports the
transition between the activities.

                        Figure 2: Activity Transitions

Although the transitions are identified as changes in participant structures, thinking about
activity transitions is intended to support teachers' thinking about how whole project
structures can be created from sets of interrelated activities. Using these representational
schemes, one can construct project schematics which are essentially representations of
projects along a timeline. We believe that these schematics can be useful for portraying,
analyzing, planning, designing, sharing, and implementing projects.
Using Project Schematics

Project schematics can help to illustrate the structure of the project and highlight aspects
of the project design such as the group supports and the flow of activities within the
project, allowing us to clearly see important differences between projects. Figure 3 shows
the schematics corresponding the three example projects described above. In the first
project representation, we can see the same participant structure utilized for all three
activities and with no transitions between these activities. In the second project
schematic, we can see a much more complex project design. However, in looking at how
the project was actually implemented, we see the same structural pattern as in the first
project. The third project shows a flow of participant structures and transitions between
the activities within the project. These project schematics can be used to formulate
answers to such important questions as whether there are sufficient learning activities to
sustain the project over a substantial period of time, whether students will have the
opportunity to engage in a variety of group learning processes with their peers, and
whether there is opportunity for students to build on their own work and that of their
peers.

                    Figure 3: Project schematic representations

We believe that these project schematics can be used for more than descriptive purposes.
We hypothesize that providing teachers with these representational schemes will help
them to design and implement effective learning activities and project structures that
better support collaborative project-based learning. By using these representations during
the process of designing and planning projects, we expect that teachers will be more
likely to employ a variety of participant structures, design learning activities to take
advantage of particular participant structures, and consider how to transition between the
activities within the project and build interrelationships between them. Beyond
facilitating planning, the resulting representation becomes a "blueprint" or plan for
implementing the project and can be used for monitoring the progress of the project. We
have been designing, building, and refining teacher workshop materials to utilize these
representational schemes for project planning, designing, and implementing.

We are encouraged by our initial use of the project schematic tools with teachers.
Through early use of these tools with teachers, we have been able to make refinements to
them. In workshop settings, our informal observations indicate that they seem to help
teachers in learning how to conceive and design projects for their students. As well,
teachers have given us positive feedback about the tools.

As well, we would like to see these representational schemes become a means of
communication within a community of teachers using our technologies, providing
teachers with a "language" for easily communicating and sharing their best practices with
other teachers. With Zebu, teachers can share projects which they have built for their
students with each other. However, we know (and it can be seen in the second example
above) that providing teachers with a ready-made set of project activities is not sufficient
for the project to be effectively implemented. The project schematic becomes a way for
teachers to visualize the entire structure of the project, the interrelationships between the
activities, and how to coordinate students to work on the different learning activities
within the project. By sharing these project representations along with the project
contents, teachers can share both the artifacts and descriptions of their best practices with
each other.

Further Research

Our next steps involve more formal investigations of the use of these tools over an
extended period of time. In examining the value of these tools for conceiving, designing,
planning, analyzing, implementing, and sharing projects, we would like to address the
following questions:

   ·  How effective is this representational scheme in helping teachers to conceive and
      design "better" project supports for their students?
   ·  How can we best use the project schematics to help teachers to reflect on and
      advance their abilities to design "better" projects?
   ·  How effective are the project schematics for helping teachers to monitor and
      manage projects as their students work on them?
   ·  How effective are the project schematics in helping teachers to communicate their
      projects to each other?
Answering these questions will help us to further refine both our technology and
technology of use and address the problem of how to help teachers to take full advantage
of the Internet and WWW for supporting collaborative project-based learning for their
students.
