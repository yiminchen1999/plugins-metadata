ABSTRACT
In this paper, the main purpose is to   explore how   participants establish and maintain        the common  ground in the
computer-based conferences. Previous studies assume that before the participants can reach the deeper level interaction
and learning, they have to gain an adequate level of common ground (Dillenbourg, 1999; Baker et al., 1999; Veerman,
2000). Subjects were 68 pre-service teachers and 7 mentors from three universities who participated in the web-based
conferencing course for eight weeks. The results assume that in deeper level discussions it is essential that participants,
especially fellow students did give not only the evidence about their own understanding by using written feedback, but
also give the support to their co-students and show their attitudinal reaction in their replies.

INTRODUCTION
An adequate level of mutual understanding is a prerequisite in collaborative learning activities. In order to construct the
common ground, individuals share mutual understanding, knowledge, beliefs, assumptions and pre-suppositions. The
common ground can be constructed and maintained during the interactive process called grounding, which requires a
joint effort by participants who meet each other at the first time in computer-mediated communication environment.
(Baker et al., 1999) At the beginning of interaction, mentioning of facts and proposals in the presence of another,
processes of diagnosis and feedback are essential for building the common ground (Baker et al., 1999; Brennan, 1998).
There are four communicative factors, which may arise problems in maintaining common ground: contact, perception,
understanding and attitudinal reaction (Allwood et al., 1991). The purpose of this study is to increase knowledge about
web-based interaction and learning by exploring the mechanisms of augmenting and maintaining the common ground.

METHODS
This study is a part of the Finnish research project SHAPE (Sharing and Making Perspectives in Virtual Interaction: Järvelä
& Häkkinen, 2001; Saarenkunnas et al., 2000). The subjects of the study were pre-service teachers in the USA, University
of Indiana (N=35), and Finland, Universities of Jyväskylä (N=12) and Oulu (N=21). The students' learning task was to
construct and maintain their case discussion and to summarise the discussion in the middle of the computer-supported
learning course period and also at the end of it by using an asynchronous web-based learning environment called ProTo.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
The data of this study contained 36 written case discussions. In each discussion there were from 4 to 26 messages, in total
449 messages. Multi-phase analysis procedure was used in the following way:
A level of discussions (Progressive and Deeper level discussions; Järvelä & Häkkinen, 2001)
Types of postings (Comment, Suggestion, Experience, New Point/Question, Theory)
Cross-references to the other postings
A type of feedback
RESULTS
Results show that 18 case discussions out of 36 were categorized to the progressive level and the other half to the deeper
level discussions. The progressive level  discussions involved plenty   of   comments, experience-based       postings and
postings with new points or questions and some cross-references. Deeper level discussions involved a lot of theory-
based postings as well as new points or questions and plenty of cross-references. Results show that 49% of the total
amount of postings included the written feedback of some kind. The number and type of students' feedback are reported
in Table 1. The difference of the feedback used by students in different levels of discussions is statistically significant

(p=0.094). Especially, standardized residuals are statistically significant in the use of supporting feedback by students.
There were no differences found in the feedback use of mentors in different levels of discussions or between students
and mentors.

CONCLUSION
These results imply that students provided valuable peer feedback, particularly task- and social oriented supporting
feedback, which   might  lead into  the constructive discussion  (See also; Hara   et  al., 2000).             Further analysis  of
maintaining mechanisms of web-based discussion will be demonstrated in the presentation.
