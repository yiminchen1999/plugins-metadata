The goal of this study was to investigate the effect the 	window state and management on the ability of users 	to maintain coherent interaction within an on-line me­.diated conference. Industry design practice suggests 	that users should be able have direct control of the windowing display system. In order to conform to in­	dustry practice the IdeaWeb was redesigned from a . single window display system to a modeless tiled win­dow display system. It was assumed that a modeless 	windowing system would be preferable because the underlying graphic display system was dynamic.",
11,,The results indicate that the students generally opted for a single window display system which is consistent with much of the previous research. Se­quence data from the event logs demonstrate that stu­dents chose to treat the modeless window as static or modal. It appears that the students were concentrating on the cognitive task of managing the on-going com­puter mediated discussion.,
12,,"This study has important consequences for screen and window design not only for developing on-line conference systems, but within multimedia systems that have dense cognitive material. If the cognitive re­quirements of the main window are high, then a titled windowing system that requires little user intervention appears to be the design choice. However, if the re­quirement to recall information from window to win­dow is low then a single window system display sys­tem is more appropriate. This would reduce not only the cognitive but the design and programming over­head as well.",

14,,1. Introduction,
15,,Collaborative learning as an instructional method has a long history. It can be found in the Academy of Plato to the one room school house of the 19th century. The positive effects of the many different forms of collabo­rative learning have been well documented. [l).,
16,,,
17,,"Social learning environments create situations in which schoolwork is perceived not as a ""task"" or ""chore"" but as an opportunity to interact on issues of personal importance. The advantage of authentic inter­action provides not only individual cognitive develop­ment but also creates an important social environment with far reaching consequences. One of the many ben­efits of collaborative learning is that it requires students to challenge, reject or integrate the new information [2] which leads to deeper understanding. 	In a social environment students engage their peers with talk that informs, explains, persuades or even entertains. This process is provides what Stasser and Davis [3) terms knowledge building and is accomplished when one tests an understanding against the ""common authority"" and requires access to multiple perspectives other than one's own.",
18,,"Even though collaborative learning is viewed as a legitimate method for classroom instruction, experts suggest that less than 10 percent of the nations schools regularly use cooperative learning techniques [4). Im­plementing a change from the traditional classroom to one that values discourse, therefore, is not a simple matter. However, networking technology may provide a solution to this dilemma. In fact ""Technology is a great Trojan Horse ... It is a great way to get coopera­tive learning in the door"" [4, p. 27). By providing the opportunity for authentic peer interaction, each student will development an awareness of authorship and the need for rhetorical competence. However, most com­puter systems were initially not developed for the more dynamic simultaneous multi-channel interaction of group interaction. Typically, ""E-mail is a great tool for person-to-person messaging but it fall flat when you 're coordinating a discussion ... Traditional E-mail pack­ages just weren't designed with work groups in mind: [5]. R. L. Bangert-Drowns [6) suggests that ""different communication interfaces might be suited to different instructional tasks. In situations where students are not just discussing, but collaborating on goal-focused work . . .  different interfaces might be needed"". Levin, Kirn and Riel concur and speculate that ""once we have a more detailed understanding of the nature of the in-",

24,,"teraction, we will be in a good position to address the issue of which medium is effective and for what pur­pose"" [7,p.185]. Consequently, group interaction is hampered by the design of the user interface.",
25,,"One area in which the typical social computing application breaks down is in its inability to manage the development of coherent discourse over time. McGrath [8] observed that when members can choose when to participate an unpredictable lag in feedback is created in contrast to typical face-to-face. In real time interaction an individual has the ability to index multi­ple speakers by tracking who-said-what-to whom­when. The ability to keep track of an ongoing conver­sation is accomplished through the use of turn-taking rules where one participant takes control of the floor and continues until they relinquish it to another which results in an orderly ""distribution of talk among the various members"" [9, p 296]. This indexing mecha­nism allows an individual to cogently and appropri­ately respond to a variety of different speakers at dif­ferent times [9 p 296].",
26,,"In a typical on-line system, however, individual responses are managed linearly making the thread of a discourse sequence difficult to follow. This break down in the ability of members to engage in a coherent interaction leads to ""individual reasoning, not collec­tive reasoning"" [10, p.149] However, by merging the pragmatic needs of interaction with a conventionalized graphical representation participants in a collaborative learning system are be able to locally manage turns. This results in sustainable, coherent interaction.",
27,,"The IdeaWeb© addressed this need by merging the pragmatic principles of conversation with a visually oriented interface. [11,12]. A salient feature of the IdeaWeb is the user display system which requires each group member to map their interactions visually thereby enabling group members to quickly determine not only to whom a message was intended but also the position of that message in an on-going sequence of messages [12] .",
28,,"The intial version of the IdeaWeb used a single window display system. However, it was assumed that the visual display system played an important role in helping the user to contextualize previous messages. With the current design, the graphic display is ob­scured while the user is reading previous messages. Consequently, in order to improve performance within the system and to conform with current interface prac­tice the Idea Web was redesigned in order to implement a multiple window system providing the users with more control [13].",
29,,"Previous window design research indicates that user performance is effected not only by type of the window display system but also by the cognitive re­quirements of the task. For example, in a study that explored the ability of users to find information in a single text window in contrast to multiple overlapping windows, it was found that novice users performed",
30,,,
31,,"much better on the task using the single window dis­play. However, as the users became more proficient in the task and more efficient in using the interface, the readers ""benefited more from multi-windowing dis­plays because these helped them locate the information they have just read"" [14, p. 613]. Further, Aspillaga [15] investigated the effect of window location in con­junction with the overlapping of graphic information in a language tutorial. She found that a consistent win­dow position had a significant effect on performance than the overlapping of a graphic illustration. Ben­shoof and Hooper [ 16] in a study using a CAI tutorial found that high ability students performed significantly better in the single window treatment than all other students.. They suggest that the single window display may have helped the students to process information more deeply. They caution however, that these results may be due to the superior cognitive skills of the high ability students who were able to overcome the higher processing memory requirements of the single window display. In a more recent study this caution seems to be well founded as Benshoof, Graves and Hooper [17] report that all students performed significantly better in a tiled multi-window display system because it acted as supplementary memory aid in support of the main window.",
32,,"Modern windowing systems allow for not only the positioning of windows such as overlapping and tiling but also different window states. The primary state for most applications has the foremost window active and is considered the top window. If other windows are simultaneously open, they are inactive and are located behind the main window. To activate a background window, a user would choose a window by clicking the mouse somewhere within its boundary. This action changes the state of the current main window to inac­tive and moves it to the background while bringing the selected window to the top. Normally, a user could perform this action at any time. However if the top window is in a modal state, the user must first com­plete a task in order to either dismiss, activate or ma­nipulate another window. On the other hand if the top window is in a floating, modeless state, moving be­tween windows does not require activation or result in a state change because all windows are active.",
33,,"Schneiderman [18] suggests that a ""general prob­lem for computer users is the need to consult multiple sources rapidly, while minimally disrupting their con­centration on their task."" [18, p. 337]. The IdeaWeb was designed to enhance coherence by inhibiting the breakdown of interaction by supporting context build­ing through the graphic display of the links between messages in an going sequence of interaction. It was assumed that maintaining coherence in the IdeaWeb would be enhanced by allowing the user not only to read continuous sequences of comments but also to reposition or resize the window in order to be able to view the position of the current node in a sequence of",

39,,"nodes. Therefore to conform with current interface design principles a modeless window system would permit the user to reposition, resize the window thus would allowing the user to view the underlying graphic with minimal interference from the system.",
40,,"In contrast, Shneiderman [18] also argues that dense, crowded and complicated displays are difficult for novices to use, the typical student in most instruc­tional situations. If Schneiderman is correct then the high cognitive requirements of managing asynchronous interaction in a computer mediated system would sug­gest a single modal window system would be prefer­able. The system would require each user to view a sequence of interaction without the distracting interfer­ence of the graphic display or the need to mangage the window such as resizing or repositioning. Conse­quently this study investigated the effect of the window state on user's behavior in an on-line mediated coher­ence.",

Notice that it illustrates that the partici­pants chose to manipulate the modeless window sys­tem a litle more than 2% of the time either to reposition or resize the window.,

The goal of this study was to investigate the effect the window state and management on the ability of users to maintain coherent interaction within an on-line me­diated conference. Industry design practice suggests that users should be able have direct control of the windowing display system. In order to conform to in­dustry practice the IdeaWeb was redesigned from a single window display system to a modeless tiled win­dow display system. It was assumed that a modeless",

84,,"the cognitive task is an important design factor. Ben­shoof et al. (in press) found that when the main win­dow was cognitively important, the tiling of the win­dow provided a useful device to help recall important information. Aspillaga (1991), discovered that an overlapping window did not diminsh performance when the data being displayed was more important than viewing an underlying graphic on the main win­dow. However, when the overlapping window was in­consistently located created a higher cognitive load with a subsequent decrease in user performance.",
85,,The results indicate that the students generally opted for a single window display system which is consistent with much of the previous research. Se­quence data from the event logs demonstrate that stu­dents chose to treat the modeless window as static or modal because they so infrequently moved or resized it even though they were permitted to do so. It appears that the students were concentrating on the cognitive task of managing the on-going computer mediated dis­c�ssion. This explains why there were no significant differences between the two window systems in terms of amount or length of the messages or in the length of the interaction sequences. The underlying graphic dis­play of the link nodes served as a orienting device which once viewed could be obscured without disrupt­ing the comprehension of the ongoing discussion.,
86,,"Nonetheless, by only partially obscuring the un­derlying graphic (see figure 2) may have interfered with the students' concentration. This may explain why there was a significant difference in linking data between the systems. Users in the single window modal system were significantly more likely to link a comment to multiple nodes . Because the modal sys­tem forced students to review comments linked to a",
87,,,
88,,"node prior to returning to the discussion screen the stu­dents could read previous comments without the visual interference of the graphic display. Even though this did not result in any significant improvement in the length of the interaction chains, it appears that the stu­dents had a better grasp of individual comments.",

90,,"This study also suggests further research. It would be of important to investigate if the users' performance or behavior would be altered as their expertise within the system improved. Additionally, if a tiling system was adopted, what is the saturation limit on the number of windows open simultaneously. Finally, what is the effect of a moveable, modal window system on user behavior. If social learning systems are to become in­tegrated within the school we need not only an under­standing of mediated interaction but also the most ap­propriate interface design for the task.",

104,,"Abstract 
Recognition of the importance of the social role in learning combined with the advancement of educa­tional applications of computer technology has sparked the development of innovative learning situations. The resulting increased complexity in the social context in which the learning is occurring requires a more in­depth understanding of the learning process. Collabo­rative learning is gaining in popularity but we still need to establish what is meant by it and gain insight into its process. This paper proposes an innovative analytical framework for viewing the collaborative process. It reports on a study with elementary school aged chil­",
105,,dren working with LEGO/Logo and their evolving un­derstanding of the scientific concept of mechanical ad­vantage. It comes as little surprise that children learn­,

109,,"1. Introduction 
Two important theoretical changes with respect to learning are at the root of the increasing interest in learning environments that provide computer support for collaborative learning. The first is the view of learning that considers both the social context and the",
110,,"social processes as an integral part of the learning ac­tivity (Brown, Collins, & Duguid, 1989, Greeno & Moore, 1993, Lave & Wenger, 1991, Resnick, 1991, Rogoff & Lave, 1984). The second is the recognition",
111,,,
112,,of the importance of learners actively constructing their knowledge as suggested by the theoretical viewpoint of constructivism.,
113,,"The creation of learning environments that renders learning more active and in a more social context is ini­tiating new challenges for research on learning. The combination of active learning and technology is creat­ing learning situations that were, until very recently, unavailable for furthering our study of the learning process. Leaming taking place in more social contexts, such as collaborative learning, is gaining in popularity both in classroom practice and research. Yet, very lit­tle is actually known about the process itself.",
114,,"In the area of science and mathematics education the importance of active learning and in more social contexts is well asserted in the literature (Gardner, Greeno, Reif, Schoenfeld, diSessa, & Stage, 1990, Put­nam, Lampert, Peterson, 1990). This change is ex­tremely important as it necessitates the need for im­proving the examination of the learning process in these domains. Greeno (1990) suggests that: ""Most research in science education treats learning in science as something that an individual student does. . . . we researchers of science education need to learn how to study the social phenomena of learning and under­standing scientific concepts"" (p. 181 ).",
115,,"The developmental theories of both Piaget and Vygotsky provide interesting insight into the role of social interaction on cognitive growth. Their views differ in that for Piaget, social interaction is seen from the perspective of its role in the development of logical reasoning. While, for Vygotsky, social interaction is at the core of the developmental process and children's learning. In his theory, individual cognitive develop­ment is a process related to transforming socially regu­lated and mediated knowledge. See Confrey, (1994, 1995) and Tudge and Rogoff (1989) for a more de­tailed analysis of these two theories.",

121,,Resnick (1991) underlines the importance of look­,
122,,"ing at the influence of social interaction (e.g. asking questions, arguing, the elaboration of one's ideas) on the constructive process. She points out that there is a need to ""seek mechanisms by which people actively shape each other's knowledge and reasoning processes"" (p. 2). Technology rich environments are providing new opportunities for learning to occur in much more social contexts. In the emerging CSCL community, Pea (1994) suggests that we need ""to be deeply con­scious about the birth of CSCL as a discipline and a new approach to thinking about learning and educa­tion"" (p. 297).",
123,,"Both the use of the terminology and the criteria for establishing a collaborative learning situation vary in the literature. Looking at the terminology, terms used to describe collaborative learning include ""peer collab­",
124,,"ing"" (Forman & Cazden, 1985), ""coordinated learning"" oration"" (Tudge & Rogoff, 1984), ""collaborative learn­",
125,,"(Koshmann, 1994), and ""collective learning"" (Pea, 1994). Pea provides an insightful reflection when he argues for his choice of terms: ""not all learning feels or probably is collaborative; it is sometimes competi­tive or coercive in nature"" (p. 286). It is interesting to note this evolution of terms and the breadth of meaning",
126,,that the terms are capturing in order to more realisti­cally reflect the interactions among active learners.,
127,,"The criteria for establishing a collaborative learn­ing situation are also evolving. Forman and Cazden (1985) distinguished collaborative learning from other forms of peer interaction based on the task being per­formed. For them, ""collaboration requires a mutual task in which the partners work together to produce something that neither could have produced alone"" (p. 329). Tudge and Rogoff (1989) distinguished studies on peer collaboration from other studies on peer inter­action on the basis of their focus on the actual process as opposed to just outcomes. This reflects the chang­ing view of research on learning and the type of envi­",
128,,ronments used to study the learning process.,
129,,"In contrast to traditional classroom group work that is often artificial and imposed, collaboration in",
130,,technology rich environments offers the potential for genuine collaboration to occur. The collaboration is genuine because collaborating with others is an optimal and desired form of working. An example of genuine collaboration in everyday life are emergency situations.,
131,,"Something happens (an earthquake, a bus accident) and",
132,,"total strangers work together to provide help, establish priorities, plan for the next move, organize others etc. There is a shared goal and the optimal solution is at­tained by working with others. In this paper, collabo­rative learning is viewed as working with others to­wards a common goal. The focus is on the process and more specifically the process as it occurs during dis­agreement between the collaborators.",
133,,Research on collaborative learning that focuses on the process rather than outcome is both recent and lim-,

136,,"and problem-solving strategies (random combinations, teractional patterns (parallel, associative, cooperative)",
137,,"isolation of variables, systematic combinatorial strat­egy) during group problem solving. Part of their re­sults showed that the most cooperative interactions that",
138,,"used the most combinatorial strategies solved the most problems. However, the pretest-posttest comparison did not show such clear benefits. Tudge (1990) raised an interesting question with respect to peer-peer inter­action. Although the research on collaboration with peers often indicated cognitive advancement (Doise & Mugny, 1984, Perret-Clermont, 1980), Tudge showed that in certain circumstances peer interaction could re­sult in development as well as regression.",
139,,Roschelle (1992) did a micro-analysis of the col­laborative process to look at the convergence of meaning while learning science. The collaborative process in his work was examined as a continuous se­,

141,,"which several perspectives of the same act were used for analytical purposes. These were: a) conversational action, b) the conceptual change from a cognitive per­spective, and c) the shared knowledge from a social perspective. Roshchelle was able to show that a con­ceptual change occurred and that the ""students arrived at a common shared new conceptualization"" (p. 264). He described the process as being incremental, interac­tive and social.",
142,,"Disagreements, although not always welcomed, are to be expected as learning becomes more active and social. The research tradition on children's disagree­ments typically examines them from an interpersonal perspective and, given the low tolerance for conflict in elementary school, focuses mostly on very young chil­dren (Shantz, 1987).

155,,"2.1. The analytical framework 
The analytical framework presented in this study was designed to look at the collaborative learning process from two perspectives the social and the cognitive. The theoretical foundation for this analytical frame­work grows out of the more recent research that looks to both Piagetian and Vygotskian theories to further the understanding of peer interaction. Forman made an in­teresting suggestion with respect to the different per­spectives of peer interaction as seen in the theoretical frameworks of both Piaget and Vygotsky.",
156,,"Forman (1987) noted theoretical differences in the cognitive and social processes under­lying collaborative problem solving in Pi­aget's and Vygotsky's theories. In Piaget's theory the parallels between cognitive and social processes are explained by the fact that both derive from the same central in­trapsychological process, whereas in Vygot­sky's theory the correspondence is due to the derivation of individual higher cognitive processes from joint social processes. These differing interpretations are accompanied by differences in the mechanism: intersubjec­tivity and perspective-taking. Forman sug­gested that intersubjectivity (from the Vygot­skian perspective) is a process that takes place across people, whereas perspective­taking and decentering (from the Piagetian perspective) are individual processes work­ing on socially provided information.",

161,,"The social move: One way of viewing the social (in the sense of intersubjective) perspective of the col­laborative process would be to examine the process, as it occurs, across the participants. In other words, given a group of participants, this perspective looks at the process from the group as a whole and the interactions that occurred as a sequence between them. The notion of sequence is introduced to preserve the order in which the interactions occur between the participants.",
162,,The coding schema used to denote a social move is based on the structural analysis of disagreements done by researchers working in a sociolinguistic tradi­,
163,,"tion (Eisenberg & Garvey, 1981; Genishi & Di Paolo, 1982; Wilkinson & Martino, 1993). The structure for a disagreement recognizes four basic components: an antecedent, opposition, resolution move, outcome.",
164,,"A cognitive move partially reflects the other mechanism that Forman suggests above, that of the individual processes working on socially provided in­formation. There are two working assumptions under­lying the development of the concept of a cognitive move. These are:",
165,,(1) During social interaction a parallel individual cog­	nitive process is taking place.,
166,,(2) (a) Each and every social act reflects an individu­	al's cognitive act.,
167,,(b) This cognitive act can be identified.,
168,,"A cognitive move therefore reflects the cognitive act that a person does in light of the social interaction. Unlike the social move that takes the perspective of across-people and from the group as a whole, a cogni­tive move is from the perspective of the individual and what this individual does in light of the information provided during the social interaction. Similar to the social move, the notion of sequence is introduced to preserve the order in which the cognitive moves take place both between the participants as well as for a given participant. Keeping the cognitive move relative to the social move as well as to the event itself allows for a more extensive analysis to be undertaken.",
169,,"This coding schema was developed to capture the different cognitive moves that the individual children used while disagreeing during their collaborative work.

The disagreement continues with another resolution move (4) and opposition (5) during which, Patricia and Kenny each added new information about the topic being discussed.

How we accommo­date these, as well as other types of collaborative inter­action, is an important consideration for future research on learning.

201,,"1. Introduction 
The Knowledge Integration Environment (KIE) project draws on technical, cognitive, and social resources to create a productive electronic learning community. We seek to design a learning environment that helps K-12 students use the as-yet untamed (and growing) Internet to acquire skill in interpreting scientific material, gain",
202,,"an integrated understanding of complex scientific ideas, and develop a propensity toward integrating knowledge in general. As more and more schools connect to the information highway, the need for learning environments increases. Such environments take advantage of the corpus of ""classroom materials"" that are added to the network daily and allow students across the nation to work together to investigate scientific problems.",
203,,,
204,,"In this paper, we describe the goals and motivation for the KIE project, delineate the framework that guides this work, describe the preliminary design of the KIE, and summarize our pilot investigation. In conclusion, we describe future directions for creating electronic learning communities.",
205,,"1.1. Motivation and Goals 
The project is exploring how exciting and rapidly expanding new electronic tools, network resources, and",
206,,"human resources can jointly improve science learning and instruction. 	At present, Net1 resources are underutilized and tools are inadequate, often limited to",
207,,browsing without direction. The Net includes a broad array of scientific information that could be tapped to improve science education.,
208,,"Educators and researchers agree that students need connected ideas, not isolated, inert know ledge. Yet students encounter topic after topic in science classes. National standards and state frameworks encourage integrated understanding, but list more topics than most students can integrate. When there is not enough time to get into a topic deeply, students become accustomed to looking at things superficially. Furthermore, incentives to integrate knowledge are few. Standardized tests generally assess isolated facts, and classroom tests often mimic standardized tests.",
209,,"The material taught in science class is often too abstract for students to understand. Students need models that are appropriate for them, problems that are relevant to their lives, and guidance to help them develop an integrated understanding.",
210,,"Teachers often understandably rely on tried-and­true methods, such as using lectures and textbooks, which can promote beliefs of ""teacher or book as authority"" and ""science as a static field"" instead of the active, understanding-focused learning and dynamic view of science that we would like students to see as they participate in science classes. To remedy this situation, the KIE software and curriculum helps",
211,,students use the Net to work on large projects designed to help them integrate their ideas.,
212,,,
213,,,
214,,,
215,,,
216,,,
217,,"1.2. Using the Net for Learning 
Research is needed to determine productive ways to take advantage of the Net connections to pre-college institutions. We need to develop good models for effective instructional uses of this resource. The Kids as Global Scientists project and the Collaborative Visualization project provide two examples of such models (Pea, 1993; Songer, 1993). In both cases, use is targeted primarily at questions involving the weather. We take a broader approach, seeking ways to help students draw on diverse information as they make sense of science.",
218,,"How can we create an instructional environment that helps students develop the integrated understanding of science that they need? We discuss instructional, cognitive, and social issues.",
219,,"In instruction, the Net has the potential for perpetuating or exacerbating the emphasis on breadth over depth in science. If students browse without a goal, their exploration may resemble channel surfing. Indeed, the Net can provide hours of entertainment.",
220,,,
221,,"The Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework responds to research showing that science courses confuse students by contradicting ""everyday"" observations (Carey, 1985; diSessa, 1993; Resnick, 1983; Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992). Rather than changing their ideas, students respond to these contradictions by concluding, for example, that objects in motion come to rest at home but not at school, or that light dies out at home but not at school, or that heat and temperature are the same at home but different at school. To support knowledge integration, science courses must help students reconcile scientific models and intuitive observations, and guide students to distinguish technical and colloquial usage of science vocabulary. To help students gain a robust and predictive understanding of science, the Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework emphasizes making connections between scientific concepts and relating",
222,,these concepts to personally relevant situations and problems. The framework suggests guidelines for designers creating science learning environments such,
223,,,
224,,"However, students need activities and resources that 	as KIE.",
225,,,
226,,"help them benefit from their investigations. The Net provides plenty of opportunities to look at or read material, but not as many opportunities to link and connect ideas. KIE provides activities for active, engaged learning.",
227,,"From a cognitive perspective, students need scaffolding for navigating and searching on the Net, and they need guidance to determine what is worth paying attention to and what should best be ignored. KIE provides tools to make the Net more manageable, and begins a process of developing resources on the Net which are useful to students.",
228,,"Making the Net a socially meaningful experience requires careful software and curriculum design. Working on the Net can be a very isolating activity. Interactions are not common among those providing information on the Web and those browsing that information. In fact, using the Net does not have to be collaborative at all. KIE promotes collaboration among students through its software design and curriculum structure as described later in this paper.",
229,,"Furthermore, according to a recent study, about 90% of current Web users are male, and 87% describe their race as white (Pitkow & Recker, 1994). The Web must be made a more female- and minority-friendly place if it is to be of widespread benefit.",
230,,"2. Scaffolded Knowledge Integration 
To make the Net an effective and efficient tool for learning, KIE follows the Scaffolded Knowledge Integration Framework (Linn, 1995; Linn, Songer, & Eylon, in press). This framework synthesizes over 10 years of research on science knowledge integration. We describe the rationale, goals, and components of the framework.",
231,,,
232,,The Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework helps students distinguish and connect their models of,
233,,"the scientific world. We view science learners as exploring and modifying a repertoire of models (Linn, diSessa, Pea, & Songer, 1994). Science is a dynamic process, nobody yet has found ""absolute truth"" in a single model or theory. Scientists enjoy testing, revising, and re-evaluating models of scientific events. To help students become lifelong learners and to prepare them for the vast array of models they might encounter when searching the Net, we can let them join in the fun of testing, revising, and re-evaluating models.",
234,,"In science classrooms, we find a plethora of alternative scientific ideas: models that the teacher and textbooks provide and ideas which students bring when they enter the science classroom. We hope that instruction will encourage students to consider, besides their own ideas, others that are useful and close to",
235,,"currently accepted ideas. The Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework guides designers to create activities and tools that develop the abilities of students to sort and distinguish among a multitude of ideas. The purpose of science instruction, then, becomes to find the best mix of models for the students, to ensure the presence of these models in the science classroom, and to engage students in analyzing and connecting these models.",
236,,The Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework,
237,,"has four main components: (a) identifying new goals for learning, (b) making thinking visible, (c) encouraging lifelong learning, and (d) providing social supports (Linn, 1995). As mentioned above, the first component involves introducing a mix of models that build on student intuitions and encourage testing, revising, and reformulating scientific ideas. Providing",
238,,,
239,,,
240,,,
241,,,
242,,,
243,,models is not sufficient for knowledge integration. Students need to understand the process of thinking about alternative models and they need support so they can do this independently.,
244,,"The second component of the framework, making thinking visible, emphasizes making alternative models accessible to students. Students need to understand several perspectives on scientific ideas in order to experience the fun of comparing and testing scientific ideas. Students also benefit when the actual processes of comparing scientific explanations, models, or theories are made visible. This might happen when two students debate about theories or when students read a debate between two natural scientists. Making thinking visible is not sufficient, however, since students also need to take responsibility for reaching their own conclusions in order to become lifelong learners.",
245,,"Thus, the framework includes techniques for helping students reflect on their own ideas, and monitor their own performance. One approach is to engage students as investigators and critics of science.",
246,,"The final component involves orchestrating productive social interactions in the classroom while guarding against situations which would support gender stereotypes or status effects (Linn & Burbules, 1993). Students can help each other compare ideas and link models when they respect each other.",
247,,"By focusing on how models of scientific phenomena can be compared, by helping students distinguish among the models that they currently hold, and by emphasizing that scientists engage in this process of distinguishing and selecting models for scientific phenomena, the Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework provides a firm foundation for students planning both scientific and non-scientific careers. Furthermore, as citizens make more and more use of the Net, they will need skills in distinguishing among models and selecting information relevant to their own ideas. KIE, by following the Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework, will help students develop skills they will need throughout their lives, and also provide tools for the development of integrated understanding of complex scientific material.",
248,,"3. KIE Curriculum and Pilot Study 
We have developed KIE software and activities which have been tested with middle school students. This section describes the KIE activities and the pilot investigation. The next section gives details of the software design.",
249,,"The KIE curriculum consists of activities that help students develop (a) the ability to critique evidence, (b) a propensity toward knowledge integration, and (c) an integrated understanding of science topics. To achieve integrated understanding, KIE activities emphasize depth rather than breadth. To ensure that students",
250,,"become independent learners, KIE activities scaffold",
251,,,
252,,"and support students as they refine their scientific ideas. Since the Net lacks organization, KIE provides a structure for building collections of Net evidence and",
253,,prompts students to systematically search for information relating to their projects.,
254,,"In addition, KIE tools guide students to use the Net effectively rather than mindlessly browsing or superficially covering many topics. Students can use KIE tools for classroom activities and on personal investigations or projects. Looking at information on the Net is necessary but not sufficient to complete a KIE project. Students must analyze evidence, producing scientific explanations for real world phenomena. In doing so, they interact with a larger community of science learners. This community ranges from their schoolmates in other class periods of the same science course to natural scientists across the",
255,,globe. The scaffolding helps students use specific evidence and also models the type of thinking appropriate for knowledge integration.,
256,,,
257,,3.1. How Far Does Light Go?,
258,,"As part of the KIE pilot study, students engaged in the ""How Far Does Light Go?"" project (described in Bell, 1995). The activity helps students integrate their knowledge by contrasting two theoretical positions about the propagation of light using evidence from both scientific and everyday sources. One position that students support is the scientifically normative view that ""Light goes forever until it is absorbed"" while the other is the more phenomenological perception that ""Light dies out as you move further from a light source."" 
	Students begin the activity by stating their personal position on how far light goes. Then they review evidence on the Web and determine whether each piece supports, contradicts, or is irrelevant to their",
259,,"position. Students next engage in a brainstorming activity to create pieces of evidence to bolster their argument by pulling from experiences in their own lives. Students can make the evidence they create available to all class members over the Net. The students then synthesize the evidence and formulate a scientific argument supporting one of the two theoretical positions. As they carry out these steps, the software scaffolds them by providing guidance and prompts. Student teams present their arguments in a classroom discussion and respond to questions from the other students and the teacher. Finally, students reflect upon issues that came up during the activity and once again state their position on how far light goes.",
260,,"3.2. Methods 
We tested the ""How far does light go?"" activity with 165 students in a classroom using the Computer as Learning Partner (CLP) curriculum. In this eighth­grade physical science class, students learn from laboratories rather than lectures or texts. The class",
261,,,
262,,,
263,,,
264,,,
265,,,
266,,"studies energy: thermodynamics, light, and sound are the topics. For KIE activities, students work in groups that function as research teams. In the pilot study, they",
267,,worked in pairs on the 16 available computers. Each randomly-assigned pair jointly conducted all aspects of the activity using a single computer. The KIE software,
268,,has been designed to support groups of varying sizes to,
269,,accommodate the differing availability of technology in schools.,
270,,"We compared the KIE implementation of the ""How Far does light go?"" activity to the off-line version of the activity that students had used the previous semester. The KIE version (a) provided richer, multimedia evidence than the text-based evidence used in the off-line version, (b) supported students with on-line guidance, augmenting the assistance coming from the teacher, and (c) guided students as they completed each part of the activity with a checklist that indicated completed work and next steps.",
271,,"3.3. Preliminary Results 
Several benefits of KIE are apparent in initial analyses of the pilot study data. In addition, pilot test results suggest ways to improve the KIE software.",
272,,"First, students worked productively with the software environment and within the activity structure provided. Student groups by-and-large made progress on their projects of their own accord and produced project work comparable to or better than in previous semesters according to holistic measures. In spite of the efforts necessary to learn the software, students could use it as intended.",
273,,"Second, students worked with evidence differently with KIE than they had in previous semesters using the off-line version of the activity. In comparing their categorizations of identical pieces of text-based evidence, students connected more of the evidence to the debate than they had previously. This supports the conjecture that the KIE can be used to productively engage students in linking evidence to theories.",
274,,"Some of the students were randomly assigned richer, multimedia versions of the evidence. For example, some students read text describing how telescopes can be used to see more stars in the night sky, while others viewed an image depicting the night sky with a blown-up insert of the corresponding image",
275,,"captured by the Hubble space telescope. Students treated the text and multimedia versions of the evidence differently. Thus, 75% of the students categorized the text version of the telescope evidence as supporting the ""light dies out"" position, while 65% found that the multimedia version supported the alternate ""light goes forever"" position. Students often connected multimedia evidence to different theories than the corresponding text evidence.",
276,,"Third, trials of the guidance for KIE projects suggested revisions for the next version. Students used",
277,,,
278,,"the procedural guidance to determine what to do next as they carried out their projects. Cognitive guidance, encouraging students to consider alternatives, reflect on their conjectures, or evaluate their progress was",
279,,largely ignored. As a result we are designing more specific cognitive guidance and also altering the interface to make this guidance more prominent.,
280,,"Overall, the pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of the KIE approach, suggested directions for further research on the role of multimedia evidence,",
281,,and motivated improvements to the curriculum and the software.,
282,,"3.4. KIE Dissemination Plans 
We will provide the KIE software and curriculum to schools wishing to help us improve the materials. Dissemination to multiple schools allows students to collaborate with others electronically. Students can post information or data to the Net and participate in on-line discussions of activities. Teachers, too, can",
283,,"work with remote colleagues, exchanging curriculum materials, pedagogical knowledge, or technical advice.",
284,,"In addition, KIE could be used by learners at home and by individuals doing school projects.",
285,,"4. KIE Software Design 
The KIE software includes commercially available tools and project-developed materials. Commercial components include:",

The World-Wide-Web allows individuals to organize existing information resources from around the globe into new representations. For example, an inspired student can take information relating to home insula­tion and turn it into an information resource on the Web structured by geographic area. As part of the KIE curriculum framework, we have designed and imple­mented a Web-based database structure composed of scientific evidence to be used by students in KIE ac­tivities.",
299,,"The Networked Evidence Database (NED) is a collection of individual pieces of evidence, where each piece has been cataloged and described using a set of identifying characteristics (e.g., the type of evidence, the author's motivation and methodology in producing it, representative keywords, and a list of KIE activities for which it may be appropriate). Figure 2 shows a piece of ""everyday"" evidence that relates to the science topics of light reflection and absorption, light intensity over distance, and vision. It shows frames from a digi­tized movie of two bicyclists, one wearing black and one wearing white, riding up a street at night.",
300,,"The NED is composed of evidence that has been created explicitly for use as part of KIE, as well as ad­ditional appropriate evidence that already exists on the Net. Submissions to the NED can come from the KIE Research Group, natural scientists, teachers, and the students themselves. As part of the KIE activities, stu-",

302,,"dents collaboratively engage in the creation of evi­dence to be published in the NED, drawing on the sci­entific methods and experience they may be engaged in as part of classroom laboratory or research activities. For example, a student team may author a piece of evi­dence summarizing a lab they performed in class or they may make a digital movie of a particular phenom­ena. Alternatively, evidence may come from news­group discussions taking place on the Net or from other information resources on the Web.",
303,,"4.4. The SpeakEasy 
The SpeakEasy is a tool for discussion and collabora­tion across the Net about multimedia materials con­tained in the NED. The SpeakEasy interface is based on a prior tool for collaborative learning in multimedia, the Multimedia Forum Kiosk (Hsi & Hoadley, 1994). Using the SpeakEasy, students record their opinion and participate in a discussion summarized in an argument map. The multimedia interface with images, texts, sound, and video has been tested and found helpful in stimulating productive discussion and reflection (Hoadley & Hsi, 1993).",
304,,"Although not used in the pilot study, the SpeakEasy allows multimedia discussions over the Net. Teachers can request that a topic be set up, list the students permitted to interact or leave the conversa­tion ""open to the public"", and attach multimedia mate­rials to their topic. Students are then able to leave their",

312,,of discourse. Students summarize the SpeakEasy dis­cussions and add these to the NED. Discussions will,
313,,sites around the world. be equally easy within a local site or between remote,
314,,4.5. Student Knowledge Integration Planner and,
315,,Promer (SKIPP),
316,,The Student Knowledge Integration Profiler and Plan­ner (SKIPP) will be comprised of two primary parts: an activity planner and a student profiler. The pilot study,
317,,allowed us to refine the SKIPP data structure necessary to support having students work through various KIE activities.,
318,,"The activity planner is used to manage a set of KIE projects, each of which has associated activities, which in tum have associated documents for student work, and guidance for students as they work on the project or activity, as well as lists of relevant and ap­propriate evidence. Furthermore, within the activity planner, teachers can design their own projects, or modify existing projects. KIE projects can be easily imported and exported from the SKIPP, allowing pro­jects to be exchanged over the Net through a curricu­lum library.",
319,,"The student profiler keeps track of the projects and activities each student has completed, as well as the evidence they have seen. The student profiler also pro­vides an entry and storage location for student inter­ests, preferences, epistemological beliefs, and knowl­edge about the scientific material. This information can then be used to allow projects and activities, as well as feedback, to be customized to particular student needs using the KIC.",
320,,"4.6. The Knowledge Integration Coach (KIC) 
One of the most important inputs to the SKIPP will be the guidance used by the Knowledge Integration Coach (KIC). The KIC provides guidance at three levels. Project-specific scaffolding guides students to think about what is the main idea they should keep in mind as they work on the various activities and look at the evidence for a particular project. Activity-specific hints help students as they work on a particular aspect of the project. For example, the student might be re­minded of the goal of writing a critique of a piece of evidence, and what is appropriate to include in such a critique. Evidence-specific hints guide the student to critically evaluate evidence in the NED. All of these levels of scaffolding model appropriate modes of in­quiry. They also provide stepping-off points for stu­dents to engage in meaningful discourse with their peers about particular activities or evidence. These hints are intended to help students develop an inte­grated understanding of the subject matter by encour­aging them to produce personal explanations (e.g., Chi,",
321,,,
322,,"Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, & Glaser, 1989).",
323,,"5. Future Directions 
The KIE project has several current goals. First, to make the KIE tools transparent and self-instructional we plan trial-and-refinement studies with a broad, representative range of users. Results from these studies guide revisions that make KIE flexible and easy",
324,,to use for both students and teachers.,
325,,"Second, to implement the Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework KIE must provide effective guidance for students. We plan research on how best to guide students. Students can currently choose the amount of guidance that they want the KIC to provide. Instead, we might diagnose student guidance needs and personalize guidance depending on how students organize the materials they access. For example, we can use information in the SKIPP to personalize guidance from the KIC. We plan to research options for providing ""meaningful"" feedback and guidance.",
326,,"Third, access to networked materials increases the importance of helping students assess the validity of evidence. When texts are the main source of scientific information students tend to accept statements uncritically. Results from our pilot studies indicate that students often extend this disposition to other materials they encounter in science classes. Since some networked materials are intended to persuade rather than inform and others are opinions rather than results from investigations, students need to develop skill in evaluating evidence. We plan to examine how students evaluate communications from peers, from newspapers, and from other sources to develop effective guidance for assessing networked materials.",
327,,"Fourth, the KIE has the potential of fundamentally changing classroom activities and extending science learning into homes and other settings. We plan to study the new activities that these resources enable. We wonder which students will benefit the most from alternative environments for science learning. We will seek ways to use these technologies to motivate students who have lost interest in science.",
328,,"The increasing availability of Net resources challenges educators to create a global community of science learners, to connect students to dynamic, ongoing science explorations, to communicate the nature of science as well as the concepts of science, and to sustain interest in science. The Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework can help make the Net a partner in science learning. Ultimately, this framework and the KIE can help students develop a lifelong habit of science exploration sustained by Net resources.",

374,,2. Collaborative Writing Roadblocks There are a numerous obstacles facing the study of,
375,,"computer conferencing and CW. Researchers, in fact, have just begun to examine the social interaction dif­ferences between CW tools such as computer network technologies and traditional writing classrooms (Forman, 1992). Minimal documentation presently ex­ists regarding the differences in communication pat­terns, teacher roles, or student writing performance across levels of CW tools and tasks. Many questions remain:",
376,,•	Will CW foster new expectations of teaching?,
377,,•	What types of writing collaborations are preferable 	to teachers and students? And when?,
378,,•	What kinds of CW activities are facilitated by dif­	ferent writing tasks and tools?,
379,,•	How do students assist each other during CW?,
380,,These questions unfortunately are often forgotten when viewing ingenious writing technologies or hear­,
381,,"ing about the exciting, new features for searching and sharing knowledge. Our research group has attempted to overcome these barriers by demonstrating how dif­ferent CW formats impact social interaction and learn­ing.",
382,,"3. A Collaborative Writing Taxonomy Bonk, Medury, and Reynolds (1994) defined CW as groups of two or more people working in concert on a common text project in an environment supportive of their text and idea sharing. In providing that definition, however, we realized that CW tools currently offer a maze of new communication channels among partici­pants (from one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to­many) and a range of text support (e.g., electronic mail, delayed collaboration, brainstorming, and real­time text collaboration).",
383,,"After surveying and testing a number of CW tools, Bonk et al. (1994) attempted to clarify this predicament by designing a taxonomy of five levels of CW tools for school learning (i.e., from electronic mail to real­	time text document sharing; see Appendix A) as well",

By examining the CW formats used in schools and univer­sities, our research projects to date reaffirm our taxon­omy of CW tools used in schools (see Appendix A) and help us refine and reevaluate our coding schemes for CW dialogue. These results should inform re­searchers, tool designers, and policy makers of the im­portance of social interaction and dialogue in various CW tools and tasks.",
389,,"4.1. Level I: Electronic Mail Tools 
The first study was conducted in a course that was project oriented and met for three hours, once a week.",
390,,"In this course, two professors interacted with 48 stu­dents organized into 12 different teams, each working on separate and unique projects. To maintain contact with each student and track their progress, students were required to complete weekly reports and e-mail them directly to the instructors. The instructors then",
391,,"responded to each student with an individualized e-mail message which was coded during the semester. The in­teraction categories were based on the six ""means of as­sistance"" identified by Tharp and Gallimore (i.e., mod­eling, contingency management, feeding back, instruct­ing, questioning, cognitive structuring; see Tharp & Gallimore, 1988). E-mail was more prevalent in the beginning of the semester and primarily performed a feedback function.",
392,,"The second project analyzed involved a two semester graduate course sequence taught by the same instructor ( one course was more hands-on/design related (i.e., hypermedia) and the other was more theoretical in nature (i.e., constructivism)). The first part of the se­quence was a discussion class in which class and e-mail participation was graded, while the second part of the course was project-based. Rich data was obtained from following the e-mail conversation for the entire year in order to determine the role it played in the learning en­vironment, the social interactions that occurred, and how this form of computer mediated communication",
393,,"can best be used to support learning. Coding schemes by Tharp and Gallimore (1988) and Granott (1991) uti­lized for this analysis indicated that E-mail was more prevalent in the design class; however, in each class, the instructor dominated e-mail discussion.",

The World Forum, developed by the University of Michigan, is an on-line asynchronous telecommuni­cations project designed to give students from six mid­dle and six high school classrooms the opportunity to interact with each other about critical environmental is­sues. Throughout these interactions, the student groups are assisted by World Forum mentors who ques­tion and guide the student groups' understanding of these environmental issues. Tharp and Gallimore's (1988) six means of assistance (noted earlier), Bloom's (1956) levels of questioning taxonomy, and Selman's (1980) degree of perspective taking developmental scheme were used to map out these interactions. In the World Forum component of the World School, stu­dents discussed, questioned, and debated with Arctic ex­plorers, mentors, and peers about environmental issues. Student role taking activities within these environmen­tal discussions (students assumed roles of famous peo­ple like Professor Stephen Jay Gould and Mr. Richard Leakey) enhanced the degree of perspective taking in their conversations.

""Starters"" were used to summarize the articles and begin discussion of the articles and open questions, while ""wrappers"" were used to summarize the discus­sion that took place. During the intervening days, stu­dents participated at least once on that conversation. Student VaxNotes were analyzed into categories like questions, clarifications, and answers. In addition, the relevancy of the comment to the topic and contribution to the construction of meaning was noted.

One class of 30 preservice teachers in an educational psychology class interacted over VAX Notes in the Electronic Classroom (EC) (i.e., the delayed, asynchronous setting), while two other classes interacted using ""Connect"" (i.e., the real-time, synchronous setting). Naturally, issues of group size, roles or participant structures, and task re­quirements (e.g., length) are critical to the effect of these tools. Coding of student dialogue transcripts in­dicated that role assignment was critical to group inter­mental processing and attitudes. Whereas the use of the synchronous software tool, Connect , increased the range of possible group assignments and interaction patterns, the analyses also illustrated that asynchronous communication (Level II) facilitated more serious and",

This article describes one attempt to develop an alter­native perspective for designing a computer mi­croworld by using a bottom-up approach to instruc­tional design. This approach differs from traditional in­structional design in two ways. First, the program was",

Sec­ond, it is considered to be bottom-up in the sense that its aim was to engage students in activities that were consistent with their provisional ways of knowing. The first section of this paper describes how the con­structs of reification and distributed intelligences were combined with Freudenthal's three design heuristics to",

509,,"1. An Alternative Approach to Designing a Micro world 
The constructs of reification and distributed intelli­gences offer complementary ways of explaining how learning occurs as students use computers. On the one hand, psychological constructivists such as Kaput [5] suggest that when students are acting on dynamic sym­bol systems, they are able to reflect on and reify their actions into mathematical objects. On the other hand, Pea [7] assumes a socioculturalist perspective to view learning as a process in which students off-load their lower-level cognitive tasks to the surrounding envi­ronment. This off-loading frees the mind to engage in higher-level thinking and planning tasks. From an emergent point of view [1], a coordination of these two constructs suggests that there is a reflexivity between Kaput's view that learning originates in reflection on",
510,,real-world actions and Pea's view of the computer as a cognitive reorganizer of mental activities.,

513,,"served as one vehicle for exploring the reflexive rela­tionship between the social and psychological compo­nents of learning. The guiding theoretical framework suggests that neither individual nor social components can adequately account for learning without consider­ing the other [1]. Therefore, the goal for designing this microworld was to encourage whole-class and group",

519,,"1.1. The Candy Factory and the MacCandy Factory The Candy Factory instructional sequence was first used in a second-grade classroom in Indiana. Reflec­tions on that project were used to inform the develop­ment of the present sequence and accompanying mi­croworld which were used in a third-grade classroom in Tennessee. The intent of the sequence was to sup­port students' construction of increasingly sophisti­cated conceptions of place value numeration and in­creasingly efficient algorithms for adding and subtract­ing three-digit numbers. The basic scenario involved students imagining that they were working in a candy factory in which candies were packed in rolls of ten, and rolls were packed in boxes of ten. During the",

525,,"teaching experiment described in this paper, the in­structional activity was implemented in three phases. First, students were asked to ""pack"" and ""unpack"" Multi-Link cubes to build imagery for estimating quantities. After the students developed a sense of this activity, the first computer microworld was introduced to facilitate the process of packing and unpacking larger quantities. The two goals of this phase of the se­quence were to engage students in activities that in­volved the composition and decomposition of arith­metical units, and to help them develop estimation skills for larger numbers.",
526,,"The second phase of the sequence involved the in­troduction of an inventory form to keep track of trans­actions in the storeroom. The issue of how to record these transactions (and thus the composition and de­composition of arithmetical units) became an explicit focus of the children's activity. Students initially used drawings and other means of symbolizing to model their mathematical reasoning. After the class negoti­ated a common notation scheme, a second microworld that was consistent with the class's notation was intro­duced. This rnicroworld contained a linked representa­tion system which provided an opportunity for students to see how their packing and unpacking activities using the graphics were reflected on the inventory form, and, conversely, how changes on the digits of the inventory form were reflected in corresponding changes on the graphics. As a final phase of the sequence, the inven­tory form was modified and addition and subtraction tasks were presented in vertical column format. After several days of instruction using drawings to support their addition and subtraction models, a third mi­croworld was introduced. This final program was de­signed to fit with the students' present ways of inter­preting adding and subtracting as well as support the development of increasingly sophisticated conceptions.",
527,,"2. Three Design Heuristics 
In order to develop the Candy Factory instructional se­quence and the MacCandy Factory microworlds, the investigators collaborated with designers at the Freudenthal Institute in the Netherlands. Their ap­proach, entitled ""Realistic Mathematics Education"" (RME), has lead the mathematics reform movement in the Netherlands. The underlying assumption of this ap­proach is that there is a reflexive relationship between design and research such that each phase informs the perspective of the other. The intent of this collabora­tion was to coordinate RME's three underlying design assumptions with the sociocultural framework of dis­tributed intelligences [7] to guide the development of instructional sequences and computer learning envi­ronments that are consistent with reform-based in­struction in mathematics in the United States [6]. The",
528,,,
529,,"three basic tenets of RME form a strong core of beliefs about mathematics, pedagogy, and mathematics educa­tion itself [ 4). These core assumptions constitute one example of a unified set of design heuristics that are consistent with the tenets of constructivism [l]. Each of these will be further described below in order to de­rive a framework for developing and researching other microworld designs.",
530,,"2.1. Assumption #1: Mathematical learning occurs through matbematization and guided reinvention This assumption is based on a view of mathematics as an activity rather than a static group of facts that must be assimilated. As students engage in and reflect on their activities, they reinvent mathematical concepts that are personally meaningful. In this way, their mathematical conceptions grow out of their own inter­pretations of their actions. Gravemeijer [ 4] uses the term ""mathematization"" to describe the process by which students begin to develop ways of organizing their situated activities into mathematical interpreta­tions. Although each student interprets his or her ac­tivities individually, the teacher can guide this process by encouraging students to discuss their increasingly sophisticated mathematization strategies, with particu­lar emphasis placed on those strategies that are effi­cient. In the case of the Candy Factory sequence, stu­dents' own situation-based activities of packing Multi­Link cubes arose out of their need to count large num­bers of candies. Eventually, through whole-class dis­cussions, the students negotiated meanings for the symbols they used to mathematize their activities using pencil and paper. Once these class conventions were established, the teacher introduced the MacCandy Factory microworld to support their mathematizing and symbolizing.",
531,,"In order to facilitate these activities, the computer",

533,,"students' previously documented notational schemes. The decision to use two-dimensional figures rather than more realistic drawings was deliberately made to support students' understandings of how their own im­agery and symbols might be reflected in their mi­croworld activities. Because the icons shown in the mi­croworld were designed to be consistent with the taken-as-shared symbols used in the class discussions, the meanings of the symbols were not assumed to be built into the interface. Further, the interface was not viewed as ""containing"" meaning, or as a tool for con­veying the concept of place value. Instead, it was de­signed to support students' mathematization activities from the bottom-up; that is, the program was designed to fit with their current ways of knowing and be consis­tent with the practices of the larger social environment of the classroom discussions.",

As video tele­conferencing technology improves and gets cheaper, this dichotomy will become less clear. For now, how­ever, cooperation at a distance is hampered by the low degree of apparent presence available and the lack of actual contact with other students.

A number of educational researchers have sought to exploit computer technology in promoting learning through collaboration.

The results of their study suggests that the collaborative use of Logo encourages interaction, discussions, coordination of different ideas and higher order thinking [12]. Unfortunately, the use of the computer in this way also promoted social con­flict over the input devices.",

We have currently developed four co-present CSCL applications designed to promote strong cooperation between users on a specific activity. Therefore each activity has one definite, predefined goal, and each user must contribute equally towards reaching that goal. In order to successfully complete the task, the users must be able to communicate about the opera­tions on the screen as well as the goal itself. In many cases the users develop their own ""language"" about the activity.",

614,,"The Color Matcher activity gives each of three players access to his or her own mouse which corre­sponds to a red, green or blue colored cursor on the screen. The goal is for the players to match a target color generated by the computer.",
615,,"Figure 1 shows the Color Matcher user interface. The interface contains two color frames, the left is the target color and the one on the right is the users' color frame. The users' color is determined by combining the RGB values controlled by three horizontal scroll bars. The color values, which range from 0-255 de­pending on the position of the slider, are shown above the scroll bars. A scroll bar can be modified only by the cursor of the same color.",
616,,"Although each user is only in control of his or her own color, the users are collaborating to reach the sin­gle goal of matching one color. In order to succeed at this activity, users must, at a minimum, communicate about the relative amounts of color needed. Users also need to communicate when they think they are close enough to check their answer.",
617,,"Each color matching activity is timed to keep the students on task. Users are allowed at most 60 seconds to adjust the RGB values for each given color, al­though they may check sooner by clicking a button. Each response is given a score between 0 and 1000, where better scores are indicated by higher values. Scores are determined by the formula score = max_distance- dist I max_distance * 1000 where dist is the distance between the target and users' RGB values, as determined by the position of the scroll bar, and max_distance is the maximum distance possible in the color space. The entire activity consists of matching ten colors. All scores are recorded in a ASCII log file.",
618,,"3.3. The Chord Matcher 
The Chord Matcher application is very similar to the Color Matcher, except that the users are charged with matching musical chords rather than RGB colors. The chords vary from a relatively easy major chord, to more difficult selections of three random notes of a 5-octave chromatic scale. Each user selects his or her note from the five octave range using a color coded scroll bar. As with the Color Matcher, users can only operate scroll bars of the same color as their mouse cursor.",
619,,"Each user may hear his or her own note at will by clicking on a button. Similarly any user may audition the current team chord, or the target chord. Any user may also request a hint, up to a maximum of ten hints per session. The users are given 120 seconds to cor-",

623,,"The user interface for the Chord Matcher is shown in Figure 2.

650,,"The majority of the students responded that they had seen color mixing before, though it is uncertain if · they meant the RGB (additive) or CMYK (subtractive) system typically taught in grade schools. However, as a whole they had not previously used a computer to experiment with these concepts. The SID users were quiet, except to ask questions on how to operate the software. In contrast, the students using the MID software communicated a great deal, commanding each other to add ""more green"" or ""less blue."" Unlike the cooperative Logo studies done by Clements [3], there was very little conflict between these users as there was no contention for the input resources although some students did get slightly frustrated in discovering that they could not manipulate another player's color.",
651,,"Overall the students enjoyed playing with both versions of the software. 	Some of the students restarted the activity after they had completed the test.

Though another did say: ""One player is better because its easier to get the right answer. You don't have to worry about what the other people are doing.""

All of the collaborative applications were tested at the University of Washington. The volunteer testers, both graduate and undergraduate students most of whom had never seen this type of interface before, were se­lected in groups of three. Each group used each of the four applications, then answered a questionnaire in which they were asked to write down their impressions of the software and the interfaces. Additionally the group interactions were noted by three observers dur­ing the testing. No pre and post testing of knowledge was done.",
655,,"In general, the users thought the interfaces were interesting and easy to use. Although all of the users gave some suggestions for improvement, none of the suggestions radically modified the underlying design for collaboration.",
656,,"The students liked using the activities with part­ners, although they admitted they would rather use them by alone. (Perhaps this is due to the fact that they have all been taught to work and learn independently.) They did feel that the user interface made them com­municate. One person noted, ""[the interface] forced me to give or receive instructions."" In fact, there seemed to be one person for each application who took the leading role in both explaining the underlying con­cepts of the activity and directing others. This type of tutor-learner relationship occurred most often during the testing of the Color Matcher and the Chord Matcher. In the case of the Color Matcher, there were a few people who didn't understand the RGB mixing scheme. This was even more evident in the Chord Matcher testing. In each group there was at least one person who was more versed in music theory than the rest. Between the tutors and the help screens, the groups decided that the best way to solve the easy (major) chord was to match the low note, then deter­mine the middle and high notes by simply adding the proper amount of half-note steps. One person, who had perfect pitch and was able to match notes almost in­stantaneously, said ""it's not fair for me to do this [activity].""",
657,,,
658,,,
659,,,
660,,,
661,,,
662,,"Unfortunately the users also pointed out that the Chord Matcher is inherently less collaborative than the others. One person's strategy was to ""work on my own note individually, [then] offer suggestions to others af­ter I'm done."" The Color Matcher had the same prob­lem, although the goal for the group is more tightly coupled than the Chord Matcher. In the former, the color homogeneously mix to form one, while in the latter the three notes are distinguishable by some peo­ple. Ultimately the team goal in the Color Matcher is the final color, whereas the goal for the Chord Matcher is to match the individual notes. In both of these appli­cations, however, most users did not change their scroll bars while others were moving, presumably to see the effects of each scroll bar individually. One user com­mented they ""picked something and let everyone else fight for a while, then made corrections."" 
	The shared controls forced the users to communi­cate in a slightly different way. Typically a user asked the others in a group if he/she should or could use a shared control. In two distinct cases, users pressed a button without first asking for a consensus from the group, but did so only once. They realized afterwards that it was a shared resource and therefore its use should be based on a shared decision.",
663,,"Finally, the users indicated that they did not feel hindered by the fact that they could only manipulate their own controls. In fact in the Curve Fitter and Midpoint activities, they felt that this forced them to communicate more. As one so aptly put it ""You are forced to talk if you want to 'win' the game since you only control one piece of the puzzle.""",
664,,"5. Implementation Considerations 
The four applications discussed in Section 3 were specifically designed as co-present CSCL activities for groups of 2-4 students sitting at one machine. The small group size was not only chosen to facilitate easy access to the machine, but also because groups of this size seem to work best for collaborative learning [5]. Furthermore, working in small collaborative groups teaches students skills needed in later life to interact with their peers in college or on the job.",
665,,"The goals of these activities, as directed by the NCTM standards, are to favor conceptual learning over rote operations, emphasize practical uses of mathemat­ics, encourage group discussions, and promote ex­ploratory, open-ended discovery [13). In particular, the programs described have relatively few shared screen objects (such as the check button). This forces the students to communicate with each other about",
666,,"manipulating the individual objects, rather than moving them themselves. In this way they are encouraged to share responsibility for the results of the activity.

While the keyboard is not expressly limited to one or even two users, it would be difficult to reason­ably fit more than two people on any one keyboard at a time.

Designers of an anchored instruction approach to learning envision a cooperative learning environment where students can create a community of inquiry while solving complex problems. 	This approach ""anchors"" instruction in the context of meaningful problem solving environments, engaging both teachers and students in sustained exploration of a rich problem space [3]. Anchored instruction requires reevaluating classroom structure, communication dynamics, and the instructional artifacts used in the process. A major challenge for anchored instruction, and problem based learning curricula in general, is to help ensure that each student learns while also gaining the experience of working collaboratively. One possible solution in­volves integrating the computer as an active ""agent"" involved in the instructional process. This paper out­lines a theoretical framework to define a learning envi­ronment that establishes the computer as a simultane­ous partner for the teacher and the students and pres­ents a computer program that employs this framework for use with students in a collaborative environment.",

Anchored instruction and other problem based learning theories offer a rich context in which to explore meth­ods of building collaboration by restructuring the class­room and integrating computer technology into the classroom discourse. The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (CTGV) has explored a number of ways to enhance the potential of each student partici­pating in a collaborative learning environment.

Efforts to achieve this goal have lead to increased achievement and attitude gains [3].",

695,,"2. Establishing a Partnership with Com­puters 
Many researchers refer to computers as ""cognitive tools"" capable of amplifying or modifying cognitive ability. Salomon, Perkins and Globerson refer to cog­nitive effects as ""effects with technology obtained during intellectual partnership with it, and effects of it in terms of the transferable cognitive residue that this partnership leaves behind in the form of better mastery of skills and strategies."" They compare this partner­ship metaphor to a human partnership which includes: ""(a) a complementary division of labor that (b) be­comes interdependent and that (c) develops over time."" [10]. How then does a partnership between an individ­ual and technology manifest itself in relation to what goes on in a classroom? To answer this let us expand on these partnerships at the local level of com­puter/individual interaction, then discuss how to ex­pand the partnership model to express the simultaneous dual partnership computer technology maintains with students and teachers in a classroom setting.",
696,,"The first partnership between individual and tech­nology, a systems view [7,9], includes the cognitive effects with the technology. The systems view teams the individual with the technology to form a joint in­telligence which shares the labor during the cognitive process. This type of cognitive distribution manifests itself in two forms. First, the technology can serve as an amplification of an individual's own ability. Con­sider how a mechanical lever can amplify physical strength to move large objects; the lever cannot move the object without human intervention and the human cannot move it without the lever. An analogous tech­",

Although asynchronous com­puter supported collaboration has been a frequent re­search interest (Harasim, 1990), on-line synchronous work is an issue that has received very little attention in the area of CSCL. Because synchronous interactions are an essential part of academic training (Cf academic learning as second order experience of the world, Lau­rillard, 1993), we chose here to focus on synchronous tools, allowing for immediate active interaction and feedback between learners.",

Human Action Theory 
Human action theory is an approach which provides",
773,,"theoretical tools for rethinking human cognition, its in­herent complexity and its social and cultural dimen­sions. Overriding many of the shortcomings of infor­mation processing theory, the concepttual approach is based on the human being as a social, intentional, mo­tivated and situated ""human actor"" with a personal his­tory and a psycho-biological presence to the world. In the study of computer supported collaborative learning, this means taking into account the characteristics proper to a situated, psychological, social incarnated actor in studying his specific learning activity. In this approach the learner is seen as capable of transforming the objects at the same time that he transforms him­self. In this perspective, cognitive objects and tasks only exist inasmuch as they are produced by a subject. 	. From a learner-centred and interaction point of view, learning activity is not a computation or manipu­lation of representations, learning is constructing meaning from information based on a human capacity to make sense and to share meanings with someone.We analyse real life learning situations and identify learn­ing as a dynamic, multidimensional activity of inten­tional, motivated and self-organising actors rather than as ""acquisition and modification of cognitive states and structures determined by an ordered set of functionali­ties and rational processes finalised by the causal ne­cessities of a predifined task"" (Linard,1993)

The preliminary findings presented are drawn from empirical work carried out within a more comprehen­sive research on communicative interfaces for collabo­rative learning.

As the field is not sufficiently structured, we think it is necessary to produce exploratory findings, by setting up situations of use and observing, questioning and trying out different alternatives. We experimented with four different collaborative writing tools trying to as­sess the appropriate task framework and time span of observation to obtain the most significant results. The complete exploratory study is intended as a comparison between different collaborative writing tools, centred on the way students would move from one type of space to the other: shared vs private work spaces, and communication vs work spaces.",

847,,"1. Introduction 
As an alternative to one-on-one intelligent tutoring sys­tems (ITSs), Chan and Baskin (1988, 1990) proposed a three-agent model, learning companion systems. They suggested that the computer can be simulated as two co-existing agents: a teacher and a learning companion. The learning companion is an artificial student who interacts with the student and learns under the guidance of the computer teacher. Thus, the learning companion performs the learning task at about the same level as the student, and both the student and the companion exchange ideas while being taught by the computer teacher. Integration-Kid, a learning companion system, explores various patterns of interactions through different protocols of learning activities of the agents (or the triad), such as, cooperation, competition, modeling, and observing (Chan, 1991). 	The performance of the learning companion in Integration-Kid is governed by a subset of problem solving expertise and some faulty knowledge. In the process of learning, this problem",
848,,,
849,,solving expertise is being expanded and the faulty knowledge is being tuned by simply deleting and adding knowledge units.,
850,,"Social learning systems are emerging learning environments that involve multiple agents, working at the same computer or across connected machines. These agents are either computer simulated or real human beings, taking various roles via different protocols of learning activity (Chan et al., 1992;",
851,,"McManus and Aiken 1993; Jehng et al., 1994). These systems are sometimes called or closely related to collaborative, distributed, or distance learning systems. In some learning activities, the artificial learning companions together with the real students on the",
852,,"network can form a virtual learning group (Lai, 1994).",
853,,"Of particular interest to this work is a protocol of learning activity where the student ""learns how to learn by teaching the learning companion"" (Chan and Baskin, 1988, p.199). This inverted model of ITS, which puts the student in the position of a tutor, instead of a tutee, is termed as learning by teaching and elaborated by Palethepu, Greer, and McCalla (1991)",
854,,"who describe a system architecture in a declarative domain represented by a semantic network. The system acts as an interactive knowledge acquisition tool and asks the student questions in order to complete the inheritance hierarchies. They speculate that such a system would be useful to a student who already 'almost knows' the domain and enhance the student's meta-cognitive reasoning skills. Following such a tabular rasa approach, Nichols (1994) develops a sys­tem. Subjects tested the system ""express discomfort at having to feed a 'knowledge-hungry' agent.""

862,,"To emphasize individualization, student modeling is usually at the core of the research of ITSs. However, there are some objections of using detailed student model because of the practical difficulty in building it. Besides, since students may have different prior knowledge, learning experience, particular interests, social background, motivation, or personality characteristics, if all were represented in the student model, it may embrace almost all the problems in cognitive science. 	For more discussion of the arguments and counter-arguments of using student model, see Self (1988) and McCalla (1990).",
863,,"There has been hesitation of using student models in social learning environments. 	For example, Palethepu, Greer, and McCalla (1991) found that student modeling seemed to be less useful and put it as an interesting open question whether student modeling is critical in learning by teaching. Also, Newman (1989) views learning interaction in a social context as a successive exchange of interpretations of the actions on the tasks by different agents. An agent does not have, or apparently need, an understanding of exactly how other agents approaching the task. Quite the contrary, it is necessarily somewhat ignorant of each other's mental state. All an agent has to do is to pro­duce some moves that in some way contribute (or can",
864,,"be understood as an attempt to contribute) to the task. The other agents do not have to know exactly what the agent thinks he or she is doing as long as the other agents can regard that what the agent does contributes a part to the joint accomplishment of the task. The primary requirement of an agent's utterance is whether it makes sense to the other agents. By a sense making response, it means that the response possesses some relation with the past interaction experience that represents a range of expectations as well as the specificity of the current problem context. Therefore, if one's response is unexpected to others, others can express their unexpectancy explicitly.",

After that is a preliminary evaluation of the system, and finally, a discussion.",

If there is an error, the student diagnoses the code, looks for a way to fix the error, receives advice if available, then revises the code. Code generation and debugging, being decoupled programming sub-processes, can be taken on by a tutee and a tutor respectively. In general, this view suggests that tutoring in problem solving in an ITS is a cooperative process between the student and the computer, undertaking two sub-tasks: tuteeing",

871,,then we shall obtain a protocol of cooperative learning,

Having a student play the role of a tutor (or a critic) is perhaps inevitable for cooperative learning in problem solving domains, since problem solving usually requires feedback in solution development, unless there is a human or computer tutor. Furthermore, the conceptualization of reciprocal tutoring, we believe, offers broad applicability to other knowledge domains.",

876,,like scaffolding tool (PLS) provides a set of Lisp 'code chunks' (or Lisp expression templates) displayed as buttons on the screen. These code chunks allow the student to construct code without making syntax errors. Thus the student does not worry about the legality of the expressions and can pay more attention,
877,,"to the semantics and the heuristic knowledge required for getting a solution. Also, the restriction of using single 'cond' construct (the 'cond' construct in Lisp is similar to the usual 'if construct in most programming",

For the system development, PLS provides two advantages. First, using the code chunk buttons instead of the keyboard, PLS cuts down dramatically the space of the student's possible responses. This permits the system to concentrate on expected responses, no matter whether they are correct or incorrect. Also, when the student is restricted to use a single 'cond' construct, the number of possible correct solutions diminishes to one or two solutions only. This, in turn, affects the design",

This super-tutor at least has to make sure that the student tutor knows where the tutee's trouble is and is able to offer relevant help. Instead of im­plementing an 'active' super-tutor agent, we take an alternative approach to satisfy these objectives. We develop an intelligent tool, called the Diagnosis-Tree (DT), to be used by the student tutor in the process of tutoring.",

889,,"DT helps the student tutor identify where the error is and construe why it is an error When the computer tutee 'presses' the button of 'Request hint' to ask for help, the tutor does two things: locates the tutee's trouble and chooses a hint to give. The tutor expands the DT, starting from the 'base case' or 'recursive case' nodes (displayed as buttons on the screen). The tutor is required to pick up the correct path in expanding the DT in locating the error. First, the tutor has to judge whether the current clause is a base case or recursive case. The highlighted part in Figure 2 is the action part of a recursive clause. When the tutor presses the 'recursive case' button, the DT expands and displays three buttons - 'recursive case incomplete', 'recursive case incorrect', and 'correct'. If the tutor selects 'recursive case incorrect' button, the DT will further expand and generate two buttons - 'condition incorrect'",

When the tutor has successfully spotted the student's trouble at the end of the diagnosis path expanded (in this case, the 'action incorrect' button), a number of hints in Chinese (can be easily anglicized, of course) are available (see Figure 3). These hints explain errors, suggest possible approaches or Lisp functions to be used, or offer answers directly. The tutor will pick a hint and send it to the tutee. If 'more hint' is requested by the tutee, the tutor will send another one. A point system is used to make sure that the dyad will not depend too much on the DT and will pay more attention to each other throughout the process. Points will be scored or deducted according to the performance of the tutor in locating the tutee's errors and there will be penalty of using hints that are too close to the answers.",

904,,problem (in a separate experiment where students used the correct solution and the error data collected for this,
905,,"PLS), we set up a discrimination net. Each node in the net represents a possible situation of the student's program and stores different levels of hints and suggestions. When the student requests hint, the student's program is matched with the net. On termi­nation at a certain node, the current situation of the stu­dent's program is recognized and the associated hints are then available for the tutor to deliver. Using the schema (a single 'cond') constrained by PLS, the problem's latitude has been narrowed to one or two possible correct solutions, so the discrimination net is rather linear. The disadvantages of this approach is that each problem needs a discrimination net. The size of each net is rather large and is thus labor intensive to build. Nevertheless, this student model suffices to provide the computer the ability to point out the tutee's errors and supply hints about how and what to do next in solving a problem.",
906,,"3.2. Modeling Tutee 
To simulate a tutee, we have to model the behavior of a learner whose knowledge of the domain appears to be advancing, even making mistakes from time to time. The tutee's response may be incorrect. The tutee sometimes even may not be able to give a response and asks for help. 	Thus, two objectives have to be fulfilled: able to model the evolving knowledge of the tutee and be 'psychologically plausible' to the student tutor. By psychologically plausible, we mean that the learning behavior and performance of the tutee can be conceived by the student. Instead of applying machine learning methods to empower the learning ability of the tutee, we take an overlay approach to make the tutee pretend to learn at about the level of an average student.",
907,,We take an example to illustrate how the simulated tutee works. Let us consider the solution of a simple recursion that finds the length of a list:,
908,,"(defun length (1st) 
	(cond 	((null? 1st) 	0) 
	(%t 	(+ 1 (length (cdr lst))))))",
909,,,
910,,"If the tutee knows how to do this problem, then using the code chunk buttons on PLS interface, the tutee has only to construct '(null? 1st)' and 'O' for the",
911,,,
912,,"first conditional clause and '%t' and '( + 1 (length ( cdr 1st)))' for the second. For '(null? 1st)', it is composed of two code chunks, '(null? ?)' and '1st'. The tutee is able to use the code chunk '(null? ?)' means that the tutee understands the semantics of 'null?' (syntax has already been taken care by PLS) and knows that it is applied to the base case of this problem. So the use of '(null? ?)' in this problem is associated with two concepts: 'null?' and 'base-case'.",
913,,"Now, we may assign a number from O to 1 for each concept to represent the tutee's proficiency of that concept. For example, if the tutee is very good at understanding 'null?', but not 'base-case', then we may assign the proficiency value of 'null?' to be 0.7 and that of 'base-case' to be 0.4. Knowing the proficiency value of the associated concepts of '(null? ?)', 'null?' and 'base-case', we take their minimum value, that is, 0.4, to be the proficiency value of the code chunk. So if a proficiency value of a code chunk is not high, it means that there is a deficiency of understanding this code chunk due to at least one of the associated concepts. Between O and 1, we may use four intervals to represent the grade of a code chunk: [0, 0.3), [0.3, 0.5), [0.5, 0.7), and [0.7, 1] for poor, fair, good, and excel­lent, respectively. Thus, the grade of '(null? ?)' is fair. Now suppose that the tutee is in the situation to use the code chunk '(null? ?)', then since the grade is fair, the tutee may ask the human tutor for hints. If the first hint is too general, then the tutee will ask for a second hint. If unfortunately, the second hint is related to the concept 'null?' that the tu tee understand well, then the tutee will ask for another hint until there is a hint which is related to the concept 'base-case'.",
914,,"For each problem, the simulation of the tutee will refer five components of the system: (i) a tutee model,",
915,,"(ii) a decomposed solution, (iii) the tutor's hints, (iv) the error code base, and (v) a set of response rules. The tutee model is a set of all the concepts of the domain and their proficiency values. The concepts range from simple such as 'null?' and 'car' to complex such as 'deep-recursion'. Thus the tutee model records the tutee's degree of understanding of the domain and hence its competence.",
916,,"A decomposed solution is a list of code chunks de­composed from a solution of the problem. Each code chunk is associated with the required concepts. For example, a decomposed solution of the 'length' problem is [('(null? ?)'; 'null?', 'base-case'), ('1st'; 'null?­arg', 'atom'), ... ].

This type of knowledge potentially fosters knowledge transfer, that is, learned knowledge to be applied to novel problems or domains.

Collaboration as a goal of learning goes together with other learning goals such as integration of theory and practice and coping with uncertainty and change. As teachers at the Open University for ten years, the authors have experienced collaboration as a learning goal among the students. Most distance students are employed, studying part time. Quite often they make their employer pay their fee. Employers do this because they want to expand the organisation's potential for ""organisational learning"", while the students tlrem­selves want to expand their current professional com­",

""Organisational learning"" is a concept put forward and given meaning by Argyris [1] and Schon [9]. Inspired by Bateson they emphasise the importance of generating double-loop learning through the questioning of assumptions. The skills required to engage in double-loop learning are skills that in a wider perspective enable humans to cope with uncertainty and take action in a multicultural and multivoiced and ever changing environment. Collaborative skills do not only make people responsive to, but more likely inno­vators of change, based on what Schon [9] has called reflection-in-action. Such skills do not necessarily come along with academic training. However, these skills are increasingly demanded among academic pro­fessionals.",

Students can adjust its position, velocity and mass; change its kinetic and potential energy; and apply a force to it by strapping a rocket to its back.

Microworlds, or computer simulations of restricted en­vironments, are an intuitively appealing way to pr;o­mote discovery and exploratory learning [4]. One type of microworld, and the subject of this paper, simulates an adjustable Newtonian universe. In it, students can experiment with concepts such as gravity, friction, force, velocity, and so on, and see how changes in their value affect the objects moving within the simulation.",
1054,,"Microworlds-Newtonian or otherwise-are not new. They were first conceptualized by Papert in his 1980 book ""Mindstorms,"" but in that era they were im­plemented as crude systems that required cryptic and er­ror-prone command line interfaces e.g., Logo. In the 80's and early 90's microworld simulations became dy­namic environments that students could alter on the fly, allowing direct manipulation of microworld objects. Smith's Alternative Reality Kit is one such example [5]. In this paper, we claim that another evolutionary step is about to take place: microworlds will become group-aware, actively allowing several students to view and manipulate the simulation.",

Since students do not have to be co-located, we assume that they can talk to each other over an audio channel such as a speaker-telephone.",

1060,,"What do students using TurboTurtle see and do? Figure 1 is a snapshot of a student's session. The lower half displays the simulation with the turtle being the ball at its centre. The turtle's location can be changed directly by dragging it with the mouse, and its direction and velocity altered by ""throwing"" it. The top of the figure shows a control panel, where tangible properties are set through constantly visible graphical sliders. These include the controls to change the turtle's size, mass, speed, the degree of friction and gravity, and so on. Students use the pull-down menus to access advanced features of TurboTurtle.",

When only the ground is hard, the relative location of the ground to the turtle is remembered as it wraps through successive screens. Students can also display a mountain scenery backdrop, which provides additional visual cues to the altitude of the turtle. As the turtle gains altitude the backdrop changes to show smaller mountains, a row of aeroplanes, and then satellites. Of course, the trails and the mountain backdrop can be cleared at any point.",
1069,,"Figure 1 shows the turtle's trail after a series of user-driven changes to the microworld1• Starting in the middle of the screen, the turtle moved down and to the right with no mass or gravity. After seeing and hearing it bounce off the walls four times, the student added mass and positive gravity, causing the turtle to bounce under gravity (the sin curve). She then changed gravity to a small negative value, causing the turtle to bounce off the roof of the microworld. Finally, she added fric­tion, causing the turtle to eventually slow to a stop.The microworld clock (set by the time button) lets the student freeze the microworld. This allows specific values to be set prior to running a new experiment.",

Exploring a dy­namic microworld is risky because it can change rapidly. In TurboTurtle, for instance, a student may ar­range a group of slider values to simulate a rocket working against a certain friction, gravity, and mass. When the rocket is launched, the simulation runs and slider values will change to reflect the dynamically changing environment. In early trials of the system, we noted that students frequently forgot or mistook one or more slider values. When they ran the simulations, they were often immediately aware of their error, and found it annoying to have to reset the values that the system had changed. Similarly, students may be reluctant to change system parameters away from an interesting state for fear of corrupting them. TurboTurtle lets students re­cover from their ventures by allowing them to save and reload named states of the microworld. Of course, this is an explicit action that students must take, and they will likely do this for only highly interesting states. Allowing time to run backwards is also a type of undo, and is a high priority in our further work.",

It begins with an overview of the system's group-aware­ness, and continues with the design decisions made2• 	In static images, such as the screen snapshot in this paper, collaborative use of TurboTurtle appears to be almost identical to single user usage. Group awareness, however, makes its style of use significantly different.

The simulation is directed by manipulating the controls on the control panel: sliders, buttons, menu selections; and by directly moving the ball position in the view.

In a complex simulation system such as Turbo­Turtle, the number of controls, including the pull-down menus and the pop-up panels, are huge and can clutter the display quickly. It seems reasonable to have a strict WYSIWIS view of the primary controls, while having a relaxed WYSIWIS view of advanced controls.",
1114,,"Second, how do students see the setting of a changed control? In a ""parcel post"" model [8], the changed value of the control would be delayed until the student had completed their action. For example, if one student adjusted the gravity slider from 0 to 20, the other student would only see the slider jump instantly to 20. In contrast, the ""interactive"" model causes the control's state to be transmitted as it is being manipu­lated. Sliders move, buttons get pressed, pulldowns se­lected. Clearly, the interactive model is preferable, as students will be able to see the changes as they are made, and are less likely to miss the actions of the oth­ers.",

A tum-taking model could be enforced, where only one student at a time can manipulate the controls. Or stu­dents may be allowed simultaneous access to all con­trols, constrained perhaps by some mechanism to min­imise confusion if two people try to manipulate the ex­act same control. We have opted for simultaneous ac­cess because we believe it will encourage each student to explore and control the simulation. Anyone is al­lowed to do anything at any time. The key to making this work is to provide rich dynamic feedback between students that leaves them constantly aware of each oth­er's actions, and encourages them to talk.",

The use of the computer as a tool during cooperative group work has added some new dimensions to the problems of equity and status differences (Cohen, 1986). First, most of the questions about small group work are no simpler with the computer than without, and second, the computer's particular characteristics make some problems even more thorny. For example, we wonder how can we be sure all students are partici­pating in an activity. When all students had access to a common set of manipulatives, we could at least look for hands-on behavior as a sign of participation. With the computer, we must sometimes depend on fleeting talk and focus of gaze as signs that a particular student has engaged with the task at hand. When we look at a group of students around a computer, it is hard to know if the student interacting most directly with the computer is also the student doing most of the thinking and problem solving.",

This problem has not gone unnoticed and considerable research has been done in the cause of exploring devices that can help ameliorate problems of differential access to the computer. In particular, the widely-held assumption that males tend to dominate computer-based interactions has led researchers to explore the effects of the gender composition of small groups on the outcomes of group interactions.",
1148,,"For example, Lee analyzed same-gender and mixed-gender groups working with the program, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. The study found differences in such factors as the amount of task and procedure-related help given and received, based on the gender composition of the group (Lee, 1993). Other studies have found that the task itself can reverse the effects of group gender composition, with different effects found for a language-arts cloze task than for a LOGO programming task (Underwood & Jindal, 1994). Cohen, in a meta-analysis of non-technology based group work studies, claims that different rules apply depending on whether the task is well-structured or ill-structured(Cohen, 1994 ). Other research indicates that groups with the most ideal gender-structuring may still run afoul of equity problems due to idiosyncratic factors in group composition (Hoyles, Healy & Pozzi, 1994). This study found that initial interpersonal hostility in a group affected the way the group organized the work, which in tum affected the group's productivity and the roles each individual was able to play in the product.",

By understanding more about group dynamics around a computer, we can learn more about group work in general, because the mouse serves as such a strong and outward marker. Since only one child at a time can hold it, it serves as a symbol of control over the group product, whether or not this control is real.",

These cases are similar in that they highlight the kind of group interaction that commonly signals gender­related problems to most observers. Anyone walking around the classroom, especially a teacher who is familiar with the behavior patterns of particular students, would probably glance at either of our two groups and conclude that an assertive boy was dominating the group once again. The teacher actually",
1300,,"drew such a conclusion in Case 1. The group in Case 2 also received a visit from the class's student teacher a little later in their interaction, in which the teacher admonished Mitch to share the mouse. The group proceeded to ignore his request and the student teacher moved on.",
1301,,"Yet, we have seen in both cases that our in­equitable situations were at worst more inequitable in technology access than in curriculum access, and at",
1302,,best barely qualifying as inequitable at all. The two girls in the case studies had the most access to the design task precisely at the points at which the group looked most inequitable: 	when the boy with a reputation for dominance held the mouse.,
1303,,"Does this mean that we should restructure all small groups so that assertive boys hold the mouse? Of course not. In MMAP, we have also observed groups that fit the pattern of our expectations quite well: the person holding the mouse actually was shutting other group members out of the design task. The point to be draw from these examples is that surface indicators alone, as convenient as they may be, cannot tell us at a glance whether a group is working well together, and that interventions based on these indicators may have effects precisely opposite to what we intend, as in Case 1, or no effect at all, as in the student teacher's visit to the Case 2 group.",
1304,,"5. Conclusion 
Whatever role the mouse plays in group dynamics, it is certainly not a reliable indicator of control over group collaboration. This is true for both kinds of control usually noted in research: task management and control over the design itself. The person who held the mouse most did not in any important sense control either task management or design features. In fact, the very notion of control becomes difficult or impossible",

Certainly the computer is a partner in the collaboration, since students often have to think of alternatives when their ideas can't be represented properly on the comp

1313,,"Still, what is one to do with the fact that Darlene and Michella both had less access to the computer than the rest of their group? There are two potential problems. First, will these girls develop computer skills? And second, do they perceive the mouse as a signal of control, and thus feel disempowered?",

Our students are required to work in groups of typi­cally four or five to undertake project work, for exam­ple, the development of a report or an information system.

1374,,"Group interaction should not be seen as limited to the performance of the prescribed task. Groups also spend considerable effort on social interaction, and on group formation and maintenance activities. Group formation activities are critical in the early stages of any group project, and require exploration of other group members' background, abilities, and interests. Face-to-face meetings are crucial during this phase, while electronic forms of interaction may be able to play a more significant role later in the project.",

Subjects were randomly assigned to the modeling and non-modeling conditions. The variable of collabora­tive context was manipulated as a within-subject vari­able. In the collaborative situation, the subjects were instructed to work on the problems collaboratively and to reach the agreement on the answers before en­tering them. After the completion of the ART in each session, the questionnaire was administered. The questionnaire contained 12 statements on a 6-point Likert scale.

As predicted from the risky shift re­search, students selected harder problems to work in the collaborative context (M=4.31) than did they in the individual context (M=3.88). For accuracy, the only significant effect found was the main effect of grade, F (1,133) = 6.56, p < .01, indicating third grade students selected problems resulting in lower accuracy than did the fourth grade students (means were 40 and 50, respectively)

1495,,"Differing from previous research on risky shift where researchers focused on unhealthy behaviors such as shoplifting or gambling, this study applied the prin­ciple of risky shift in a constructive way to encourage students to select challenging tasks in their academic activities. Furthermore, this study provided explana­tions for risky shift in computer supported learning environment. Students in a computer supported col­laborative risk-taking context tend to take higher risks because they feel less threatened by the consequences of failure, a finding consistent with research showing that students take high risks when external constraints are reduced. Also, students in the computer supported collaborative context took higher risks because they felt they gained information from each other by work­ing as a collaborative learning group, a finding con­sistent with that in economics research that informa­tion reducing ambiguity increases risk-taking (Ellsberg, 1961).",

CoNote is a computer supported cooperative work system intended to facilitate communication within a work group through shared annotations (marginal notes) on a set of documents. The central idea is that shared 	annotations 	provide 	an 	effective communications forum for groups whose work involves frequent reference to some set of documents (e.g., teachers and students, field service workers,",
1517,,"editors and publishers, standards organizations). In our",
1518,,"experience, the shared annotations model provides a richer electronic forum than media such as news groups, bulletin boards or mailing lists. The key difference is that the documents being annotated provide a context for group discussions, thus enabling people to find discussions on particular topics more easily. The shared annotations model also provide a more structured forum than shared authoring tools, because the documents play the role of a fixed context for the discussions rather than being mutable themselves.",

In particular, using CoNote we have rarely seen the same question being asked by different students, because they are able to find and understand other students' questions and answers.

CoNote is based on the World Wide Web, and is thus accessible to anyone with a Web browser supporting forms.

Actually, only links to the annotations appear in the document; the annotations can be accessed by navigating this link structure. Numerous word processing systems permit annotations ( e.g., Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat) but in such systems the annotations modify the document, and are not shared. In contrast, CoNote annotations are seen by all members of a work group. In the CoNote system, documents and users both belong to groups, which provides various levels of access control (as discussed in the following section).",

The CoNote model of the collaboration process is based on the concept of a document group, which is a set of people who share a collection of documents. Each person in a group has a certain role with respect to the documents in that group. The possible roles are viewer, reader, user and author, where each of these roles has more access to the documents than the one before. 	A viewer may view an annotated document, but can't see the annotations on it. A reader can also see the annotations, but can't add any. A user may read and add, and an author may read, add, and also delete annotations. In addition, annotations added by an author are considered authoritative and marked as such .",

This tends to focus activity on the online versions of problem sets, particularly as the due dates approach. For example, in the first 57 days of the current semester (from Jan 20, 1995 to March 17, 1995), 428 annotations have been made, and these have been read 7704 times. The distribution of the number of annotations read over time shows a strong correlation with the due dates of problem sets, as illustrated in Figure 2.",

The presentation of this paper is intended to document the potential of the Internet to foster collaboration and conceptual change between people who have never met face-to-face. Indeed, this paper is an example of the collaborative effort undertaken that would not have happened without the Internet technologies available. At this writing, none of the contributors have met in person. The collaborative effort to write this paper has been accomplished via the Internet, as have the development of the projects discussed herein. The distance involved spans 	over 15,000 miles and uncountable hours of effort to bring them to their current stage of development. All but a few of the people involved in the projects are either working or studying full-time; the others work full-time-and-then­some on the projects.",

During the months of April -June of 1994, two in­dependent organizations established themselves as entities on the Internet.

What makes VOU different from other universities? By existing in a virtual environment without the costs of maintaining a physical plant, VOU can offer a high­quality educational experience at a greatly reduced cost to the student.",
1659,,"Bill Painter and Robert Donnelly started with a vi­sion for a new school house - one based completely on the Internet. VOU evolved from their interpretation of a mandate set forth by GNA and its Gold Curriculum Review Committee. What they proposed was the cre­ation of an accredited Liberal Arts College set in virtual reality - A place where students would help create their own learning environment, work cooperatively in small groups, and explore their world via the global in­formation superhighway.",
1660,,"In a few short weeks, Painter and Donnelly along with Dan Gerson designed and programed a text-based virtual educational environment known as Virtual On­line University. The next task was to create learning tools and train instructors to use them effectively.",
1661,,"While teachers know how to use traditional tools like a chalkboard, overhead projector, to lecture, teach­ing online eliminates most of the cues good teachers use to monitor their student's progress. As instructors cannot see their students, in this environment, puzzled looks and even the simplest interaction filters through abstracted typed text. In such an environment, showing a student what to do takes time, typing, and very pre­cise language. These do present some problems in the interaction between instructor and student but they are overcome in a short time. As the technology improves over the next few years this problem will soon be eliminated as audio and visual Internet links are devel­oped and improved.",
1662,,"Regardless of the teaching environment, instruc­tors generally use a lecture approach in-real-life and tend to deliver electronic lectures online. As this is a little more difficult to do in this environment, the first tools created or transported from other Moo's (Multi­user, Object Oriented environment) were the classroom, slide projector, notice board, and of course, the lecture. The lecture allows instructors to pre-load their thoughts, instructions, and communications and then deliver them line by line to their students.",
1663,,"In essence, the lecture epitomizes the paradigm shift required to restructure traditional education into a Virtual Educational Environment (VEE). The difference between the two can be compared to the evolution of automobiles from the horseless carriage to the modem car.",

1665,,"7. Advantages of Working in a VEE Much like the horseless carriage, the 'lecture' approach to delivering instruction in a VEE tries to adapt a well known approach to a new technology with varying re­sults. The lecture is very effective when instructors pause to allow a dialogue to develop and incorporate other teaching tools into it. The ability to access pow­erful tools such as the World Wide Web and Gopher browsers, simulations, tutorials, and most signifi­cantly, the VEE itself are a very compelling teaching device. The online browsers make gigabytes of infor­mation available to students, while tutorials and simu­lations can provide 24 hour a day access to detailed, in­formation presentation, practice and feedback.",
1666,,"The VEE itself serves as a most important re­source to students. It can be changed to respond to the requirements and desires of the learning community, by creating new spaces to match the curriculum and activi­ties. Students can also add rooms and create objects to illustrate their conceptual understanding or to assist others in gaining such insight.",
1667,,"For example, a science student may create a demonstration and prepare a hypertext document relat­ing their ideas to the theory. This becomes a portfolio of work for assessment. Traditional evaluation, if de­sirable, including multiple choice, fill in the blank, and matching exercises can be built with relative ease.",
1668,,8. Disadvantages of Working in a VEE,
1669,,"Like most human creations, VEE's have their draw­backs. The current technology limits interpersonal in­teractions to text alone. Even worse, participation in the VEE depends on typing ability and knowledge of the English language. The command structure confuses even veteran MOOers, and the text output from players in the same location mixes together into a continuous stream of indecipherable babbling. Leaming to survive in this demanding environment may take time, and not suit the tastes or learning styles of some people. The greatest limitation is the lack of good research into the niceties provided by interactive learning environments. Hopefully, in the near future, most of the disadvantages will vanish as the technology improves, where all that will be missing is the lack of face-to-face person-to­person interaction",

This paper considers computer-based support for the development of computer skills in the workplace. We suggest that computer systems should be designed to support collaborative learnability; to this end, we offer a number of collaborative learnability design princi­ples.

We suggest some principles of collaborative visibility and highlight the importance of the demonstration in the sharing of skills. The various design principles are incorporated into a generic model for collaborative user support called MutualAid. A specific system based on this model is also described.

This paper considers computer-based support for the development of computer skilli in the workplace. The focus on computer skills reflects both our background in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and our practical experience in helping people to develop these skills. Although some of our design ideas are particular to the development of computer skills, we see the fundamen­tal basis of our approach as relevant to many other ar­eas of learning in the workplace.",
1722,,Our approach is based on a simple premise - the type of support of greatest value to computer users is,

1726,,"knowledgeable assistance from their colleagues. We contend that user support should be designed to take advantage and to improve the quality of this mutual as­sistance. We have no hesitation in defining our work as computer support for collaborative learning. However, the fact that this learning occurs in the workplace, and not in an educational institution, has a profound influ­ence on the nature of the collaborative learning and on the form of the computer support. As Koschmann et al. [11] remind us "" ... the presence of ill-structured problems in ill-structured domains is probably typical of most substantial attempts to use knowledge effec­tively in the real world. Well-structured knowledge do­mains and well-structured problems are almost exclu­sively the property of schooling"" (p. 232).",
1727,,"Our research focuses on the learnability of com­puter systems or computer-based tools. We define learnability as the properties of a (computer) system that aid in the learning of that system's use. Any defi­nition ofleamability, however, depends ultimately on a definition of learning. We use the term collaborative learnability to emphasize a view of learnability based on a collaborative notion of learning. We are particu­larly interested in developing a number of generic de­sign principles encompassing the essence of collabora­tive learnability. The various principles are incorpo­rated into a generic model called MutualAid. We further illustrate our approach by describing a specific instance - MutualAidl - of a collaborative support system de­veloped from this basic model.",

Understanding completely the func­tionality of a tool (in the way that developers do) is nothing like understanding the situated application of that tool in workplace activities. Fortunately, in their efforts to come to terms with these areas of understand­ing the worker is rarely alone, he or she shares many of the situational factors with fellow workers. We see this as the basis for collaborative learning in the workplace. There is considerable evidence to support the proposi­tion that asking a colleague is the most common and most valued form of support amongst computer users [6,7,19].",

1764,,"7. 	Outline of the MutualAid Model 
We use the term collaborative support system as a generic name to cover a whole range of possible tech­nological systems designed to incorporate collaborative",
1765,,learnability. Our MutualAid model provides a generic basis for the development of specific systems utilizing different forms of technology. MutualAidl (MAl) is one such system. It is a group-based asynchronous in­formation sharing system focussed mainly on develop­ing computer tool skills. This particular system uti­lizes recorded demonstrations as the principal means of communication and a collaborative forum and database,
1766,,to support discussion and subsequent storage of local knowledge. We emphasize that the MutualAid model is deliberately minimal and the MAI system is a minimal prototype. There are a number of reasons for this min­imalist design approach:,
1767,,,
1768,,"7.1. 	The Conceptual Model 
The basic conceptual MutualAid model is represented in (figure 1). It is as a cyclic process of capture, shar­ing and discussion. Problems, solutions, related experi­ence and the discussion process itself are captured and made visible within a support group. The various con­tributions are stored for reference purposes. The driving force of the system is the collective resolution of ev­eryday dilemmas (or innovative opportunities) associ­ated with the use of complex tools in variable work ac­tivities, where time and quality are critical elements.",
1769,,"7.2. 	The Functional Model 
The MutualAidl system is a particular instance of a system based on the MutualAid generic model. Al­though this instance may be a valuable way to illus­trate the general model we can derive many other spe­cific instances from the basic model. The MutualAidl system can be considered as three functional elements, the multimedia recorder tool, the problem-solving fo­",
1770,,rum and a local database. The multimedia recorder tool,
1771,,,

1773,,,
1774,,,
1775,,,
1776,,"is the principal method of capture in the system, al­though textual, graphical and other forms of representa­tion can also be used. In order to facilitate the sharing of problems, solutions and general information and supporting the subsequent interactive discussion; we need some method of making these issues more visible or public within the support group. This is the func­tion of the problem-solving forum. As a by-product of these processes a local database of practice is built up.",
1777,,"7.2.1. The multimedia recorder tool 
Although it is possible to create textual and graphical descriptions of problems and solutions using the sys­tem, by far the most important method of communica­tion is the recorded animated demonstration. There has been little if any published research into animated demonstrations created by end users. The recorder tooi2 allows the user to record an animated demonstration of screen events with a coordinated verbal commentary. The recording can be based on an individual demonstrat­ing some aspect of tool use or it can be a recording of an interactive demonstration, that is, what we have",
1778,,,
1779,,"7.2.2. The problem-solving forum 
The term forum (i.e., a place of public discussion) re­flects both collective visibility and interactivity. The forum is the place where interaction, which is a vital part of the sharing and development of practice, takes place. It is also the way in which the local database grows and develops. Problems, solutions, experiences and general comments are made public within the group by inserting them as documents in the forum space, inviting responses from other members of the",
1780,,"group. Responses to issues in the forum may take the form of new documents or may be additions to the original document. Recorded demonstrations can be added to existing documents very simply. To support the forum in Microsoft Windows we use a program group as a form of noticeboard on which documents can be posted. When discussion on an area in the forum has reached a reasonably stable state, the relevant re­sponses are transferred (by the support person) to the permanent local database.",
1781,,7.2.3. The local database,

A simpler method of acti­vating them is to embed them in a document as an icon using Microsoft Windows Object Linking and Embed­ding (OLE™). Recorded demonstrations can be embed­ded in a variety of document types. Documents with embedded demonstrations can be submitted to the fo­rum or demonstrations can be added to existing docu­ments already in the forum or database.,
1786,,"It should be emphasized that the users of this sys­tem are expected to be relatively inexperienced end users, we therefore want a method of operation that in­vites participation rather than adding to their learning burden. Perhaps the principal advantage of the recorded demonstration is that it can convey a great deal of in­formation and yet is both easy and quick to create. We have found that a 30 second long recorded demonstra­tion can convey a considerable amount of information and takes only a short time to record and embed in a document.",

The demonstrations should be easy to access as a reference when someone needs to be reminded of the way to do something. Consequently speed and ease of access are important structural issues in the organiza­tion of the database. The central question in the organi­zation of this local database is not how we should structure it, but what methods of structuring do we need to provide for the users.",

Student participation in collaborative, open-ended in­quiry is a central goal of many current science educa­tion reform efforts. Collaborative inquiry is considered desirable, in part, because it reflects the authentic prac­tice of science by scientists. However most student& in high school science classes have little experience con­ducting open-ended investigations either alone or in groups. To provide a scaffold for students as they learn to conduct collaborative inquiry, we have developed a shared multimedia database application called the Collaboratory Notebook. The software has been de­signed with the explicit goal of supporting both collab­oration and scientific inquiry. It has been created by the Learning Through Collaborative Visualization (Co Vis) Project as part of an investigation into the use of advanced computing and networking technologies to",

This makes genres a potent instrument for instruction, and indeed the formal features of genres like research reports are often used for teaching. There is some reasonable doubt, however, as to the wisdom of ""teaching"" students genres, at least in the most didactic sense [5, 6].",
1819,,"No doubt, the process by which students acquire a written genre is a complex one, and this complexity is not due just to the need for them to acquire new vo­cabulary and to learn to put it together. Because com­position is a form of social interaction, learning to compose within a genre is a process of socialization.",

From a peda­gogical standpoint, these uses of the software to moni­tor and guide students in the course of their work, indi­cate a role for the Collaboratory Notebook in support­ing an increased attention to the students' process of learning as opposed to the traditional emphasis on final products.

It was our hope that communication-centered applications like the Collaboratory Notebook would not be used differentially by boys and girls. Typing, and the use of specific computer applications, such as word processors and on-line services, were considered in order to examine the importance of prior experience and prerequisite skills. Finally, we assessed students writing apprehension in relation to their Notebook us­age because of the possibility that discomfort with writing might reduce the size or number of pages writ­ten by students in their notebooks. We used The Writ­ing Apprehension Test (WAT) [15], a measure that is designed to judge an individual's degree of comfort with written communication.",
1862,,"We developed regression equations for notebook size measured in total number of pages, diversity in use of page links, and the branching factor of Notebook pages respectively.

None of the other outcome measures we examined (i.e., words per page, average cluster size, average depth) had reliable simple correlation measures with the independent variables listed above. The regression equations accounted for variance (R 2) in the outcome measures in the range of-12% to -25%.",

In spite of frequent recommendations for group work with computers as superior over individual work it is still far from obvious how collaboration supports progress [7].

1889,,"However, young children may not use explicit conceptual arguments in their collaboration, even in dealing with an arithmetic content where conceptual explanation would be the most powerful. Nevertheless, children in collaboration seem to be resources for mu­tually precipitating learning, even if this sometimes does not always agree with their intentions: when they try to share their knowledge they do not always suc­ceed, but on the other hand they may provide each other with learning experiences even in the midst of mutual misunderstanding. Knowledge concerning these collaborative processes of learning is of great educa­tional interest and value.",
1890,,"2. Conceptual Change and Collaboration Conceptual change, in our view, is a phenomenon al­ways taking place within the zone of proximal devel­opment [9], a zone of capacity for enhanced perfor­mance under adult guidance or in collaboration with peers. When developing educational software applying this concept, we have always admittetd the guiding role of the teacher. We thus agree with Rogoff [8] when she takes both guidance and participation in culturally val­ued activities as essential to children's cognitive devel­opment. As a consequence we have not designed our software to function in isolation from human interven­tion.",
1891,,"As our aim in the long run has been to produce games suitable for classroom use, peer collaboration is of focal interest to us. Actually peer collaboration car­ries a dual function in our studies. It exemplifies the classroom pedagogy we are aiming at, and it is our re­search tool for exploration of the processes of chil­dren's learning in interaction with our games. In both cases our pedagogic stance has been to minimize, but not totally withdraw adult guidance. Pedagogically we see learning through peer collaboration as promoting cognitive as well as social aspects of development.",

Kevin, who has taken it for granted that Lisa naturally would have cho­sen ""2 steps"" for getting from ""stone 6"" to ""stone 8"" is jolted into explaining his rationale. However, it is not transparent from Lisa's perspective that he is talking about a chunk of the track in his explanation. Although the episode seems to have rocked her faith somewhat, Kevin's explanation does not illuminate the step prin­ciple like a bolt of lightning and make her abandon the target principle she has embraced so far.",
1904,,"When the Rabbit is back in the same place again Lisa very cautiously accepts Kevins suggestion that she should select ""2."" It works, but she still turns to the teacher with a worried comment on the next situation, where the Rabbit has to go to ""stone 13"":",

1912,,"formulation of the alternative perspective, and then, immediately, with Kevin's openly displayed invention of a working solution method for counting those ""numbers in between."" It is evident from her next move, that here the landscape from her perspective has at last changed into a problem of the current part of the whole journey.",

The tool of collaborative learning at work is the support system under scrutiny. The support systems at work usually include assumptions about the work and learning they are trying to support. However, these reasons for the tools being the way they are designed, start to disappear along with the development of the work while the support system remains the same. On the other hand, as work, its procedures, and its context develop in the course of time, they are left unsupported if the support system is not changed (see e.g. B!lldker's [6] analysis on the tool used in Danish National Labour Inspection service). Therefore, learning support systems should be changeable in the course of time.",

1974,,"2.4. Community 
The community of collaborative learning in schools is often a small group of learners, usually students in the group because learning is the main activity [as in 9, 16]. At work, however, working and learning are intermingled and it is recognised in recent CSCW research that collaboration does not require homogenous groups but collaboration is constituted by work processes that are related as to their content [2]. Thus, the learning community does not have to be a previously defined group of people, but instead it should be formed more or less around the working activity. This demand is furthermore supported by the study of Eveland et al [12], who found that the help providers were ""sought out as much for their similarities to the help recipients in terms of work and position as for their technical qualifications"" [p. 272]. Therefore, the network of helping relationships should follow in the first place work activity alignments rather than technical or pure subject matter specialization.",

This requires that the learning community may be expanded when necessary and the support system should help in expanding the community. Thus, the fourth requirement is to support the construction of learning community around the work and to expand it.",
1982,,"2.5. Division of labor 
The traditional assumption about learning in schools is",
1983,,"the division of labour between students and teachers. There are supposed to be a teacher who knows the knowledge and students who are ignorant and need to learn. Similarly, the dichotomy between experts and novices at work assumes that experts have learned enough and it is the novices who have to learn. However, the distinction between those who know and those who do not know is not important [5, p. 172], because ""expertise is a fluid, social construction that is constantly subject to redefinitions, the more so in times",

1987,,"how to influence them."" 
	This transition from an authority to self assessment",
1988,,"and collective reflectivity requires that the learning support system should support critical reflecting and the going beyond the existing ways of working. Ciborra and Schneider [8] have also noticed this requirement and suggest that the tools ""should support people's capabilities for reflection and inquiry within the context in which they are embedded."" [p. 286). Thus, the last requirement for support systems is to support continuous and collective reflectivity at work.",

2027,,This paper discusses how technology can usefully extend the collaboration process in face-to-face settings as well as prepare students for collaboration in the workplace.

An environment in which design teams can learn how to interact and succeed in their work is de­scribed.,

2029,,2. Teams,
2030,,A common practice in industry is to bring together people of multiple disciplines and expertises to achieve a common goal [Katzenbach91]. One of the greatest challenges in this setting is getting a group such as this to work together as a team. Each member brings his/her strengths (and weaknesses). The objective of the team approach is to develop solutions which are better than those any individual would likely produce.,
2031,,"""Team"" is a familiar word and concept which has many interpretations. In this context, good teamwork results from listening and responding constructively to other's views, support and dedication to shared goals, and full participation. Good team characteristics also",

2033,,"mance measures directly assessed from collective work-products. Members encourage open-ended dis­cussion and active problem-solving meetings [Katzenbach91, Hutchins93].",
2034,,"To be successful, a team generally needs people who bring a varied expertises and who can fill a variety of roles --- organizing, evaluating, detailing, moderat­ing, etc.",

2037,,"productive are often the team meetings. A meeting is a work on a project, the most intensely collaborative and",
2038,,gathering of people with a purpose where communica­tion among participants is the central activity.,
2039,,"Most meetings occur in an enclosed space with tables and chairs while the communication media are limited to verbal exchanges and visuals such as paper, overhead projection and video. Direct communication is largely limited to speech and the passing of docu­ments.",

2045,,"As participants use the oral medium, the meaning of words and objects (sketches, charts, text, etc.) inter­weave to construct mutual understanding. If a team member is trying to explain how an engine works, for example, then the member may use photos, video, dia­grams, graphs, and words to foster an understanding for others. Others in the team may use the spoken word and the other representations to query the expert on how the engine works and the terminology which describes it. Without clear communications, the team may spend hours needlessly debating before they rec­ognize and correct a simple misunderstanding.",
2046,,"During a design project, a team travels through an abstract domain of ideas in which they collect, com­pare, join, discard, revise, etc. The path taken includes many decisions made along the way, and a group may use many decision making methods during the design process.",
2047,,"When a decision is made by consensus, all mem­bers usually understand the decision and are prepared to support it. In practice, consensus means that all members can rephrase the decision to show that they understand it, that all members have had a chance to tell the group how they feel about the decision, and that those members who continue to disagree or have doubts are nevertheless willing to give the decision a try.",
2048,,"Throughout the process, the design team tries to attain a mutual understanding of issues and solutions. When a group has a mutual understanding, they are able to move to consensus on a point.",
2049,,The construction of a mutual understanding through dialogue includes both agreement and dis­agreement. [Burnett93) found a significant positive correlation between the amount of substantive conflict during invention and the final product quality. Sub­stantive conflict appears to allow participants to fully explore the possible alternative courses of action.,
2050,,"4. Face-to-Face Meetings 
Problems in traditional meetings include ideas that do not surface and are lost, time wasted on ""political pos­turing,"" the serial nature of communications (i.e., dis­cussions of one topic at a time), and documenting the meeting [Dallavalle92). In recent years meeting rooms have incorporated telephones and television in order to permit live communication with distant conferees and for showing pre-recorded material (essentially ""hard copy""). Computers have also been added to gather, organize and distribute information.",
2051,,"Distance collaboration offers obvious advantages but suffers from bandwidth limitations of current communications technology. To explore the ultimate promise of coming technology and to address directly opportunities present in most on-campus college set­tings, we consider face-to-face meetings.",
2052,,,
2053,,"5. Media in Meetings 
Multiple media give individuals many ways to express their ideas in written documents, notes, sketches, graphs, tables, audio and video recordings, etc. A vari­ety of formats allows others to view an idea from many viewpoints, increasing each person's chance of gaining an accurate understanding.",
2054,,"For example, the floor plan of a house gives no di­rect sense of vertical dimension. However, two draw­ings or a perspective drawing can make it possible to comprehend the third dimension. A dynamic on­screen walkthrough is even better. On the other hand, graphical instructions on assembling a bike without any text would be of little use. Words are generally helpful in describing how to make parts fit together. In a third example, the weatherman may say it is ""cold"" outside. For someone in southern California, ""cold"" may be 50 degrees while someone in upstate New York might define ""cold"" as 20 degrees. Without the numerical representation for the temperature, the meaning of ""cold"" is ambiguous.",
2055,,"In a collaborative design session, there may be other options for expressing ideas. When an idea is in­troduced, it may be rendered in multiple forms thereby increasing the chance of its being understood. Differ­ent ideas generally benefit from expression in different media, each medium chosen to best convey an aspect of the idea at hand. Furthermore, modern electronic communication can bring appropriate information from a myriad of sources in various media to a team. This access to global information resources prevents unnec­essary delays and delivers information when it is most valuable and usable.",
2056,,Good multiple media will free people to think as­sociatively and attach comments to the ideas being pre­sented. Team progress and reports may be thus built automatically during deliberation. Appropriate tools may also encourage multitasking in the sense of a per­son concentrating on the current topic without forget­ting what s/he wants to say (whether or not that topic has passed).,
2057,,"When multiple sources of information compete for our attention, cognitive issues are raised. For example, most people are able to listen closely to one speaker yet give enough attention to others to permit them to detect enough content to earn a shift of attention.",
2058,,"The use of multiple media raises further cognitive issues. For example, the confusion present when mul­tiple sources communicate within a single medium may be reduced when the sources are spread among several media. Multiple media sources may affect the level of interest generated and may serve either to stimulate or distract participants. The sequencing of in­formation may be easier when alternate media provide alternate channels for acknowledgment of receipt.",

Therefore, they need help in accomplishing unfamiliar tasks that are part of an expanded job. Beyond the need for new and changing domain knowledge, there is also a large de­mand for new tool knowledge.",
2143,,"2.2. Distributed Cognition 
Learning is part of living, a natural consequence of be­ing alive and in touch with the world, and not a process separate from the rest of life. Acquiring knowledge cannot be restricted to obtaining a prescribed education at a given time. What learners need, therefore, is not only instruction but access to the world (in order to connect the knowledge in their head with the knowl­edge in the world). Education should be a distributed lifelong process by which one learns material as one needs it. Distributed cognition (Norman 1993) is a ne­cessity in response to the limitations of the individual human mind.",
2144,,"Distributed cognition needs to include humans and things, and the two infrastructures should complement each other. Humans (e.g., coaches, peers, practitioners from other domains) have extensive background knowledge and a shared understanding unavailable in things. Things can store information (e.g., books), highlight relevant information (e.g., graphs, mathemat­ical notations), and retrieve, compute, and analyze in­",

Illich (Illich 1971) (long before the world-wide web and the information superhighway were a reality) has envisioned learning webs as an alternative and aug­mentation to traditional schooling. The major objec­tives that he envisioned his learning webs would pro­vide were (1) reference services to educational objects, (2) skill exchanges, (3) peer matching, and (4) refer­ence services to educators-at-large. Many collaboration technologies (e.g., most Computer-supported collabo­rative work systems) employ the computer as a medium with few interpretable components. Future computational environments need to integrate humans and computational resources more creatively. Compu­tational environments that can interpret objects, ac­tions, and artifacts (not only from a tool perspective but also from a domain perspective) can make infor­mation and resources available at the bidding of the user, whereas persons become skill resources only when they consent to do so, and they can also restrict time, place, and methods as they choose.",

Do­main-oriented design environments (DODEs) (Fischer 1994) exploit domain semantics and the design context to actively notify designers when there is information they should know. Many current design systems are limited because they function only as ""keepers"" of the artifact, in which one deposits representations of the ar­tifact being designed. Our experience has shown that designers integrate designing and discussing in such a way as to make separate interpretation difficult (Reeves 1993) .",
2151,,4. Domain-Oriented Design Environments DODEs have emerged in our research work as compu­tational environments in support of collaboration. They are semiformal systems that integrate object-oriented,
2152,,"hierarchies of domain objects, rule-based critiquing systems, case-based catalog components, simulation components, checklists, and argumentative hypermedia systems. They support communications and negotia­tions among all involved stakeholders and between the designers and their work in progress. They do limited reasoning and interpretations, trigger breakdowns, de­liver information, and support the exploration of the rationale behind the artifact.",

The Voice Dialog Design Environment (VDDE) (Repenning and Sumner 1992) will be used to illustrate our conceptual framework. Voice dialog interfaces consist of a series of voice-prompted menus. Users press buttons on a telephone keypad and the system re­sponds with appropriate voice instructions. Current in­terface design techniques for voice dialog systems are based on flow charts. It is difficult for designers, cus­tomers, and end-users of these systems to anticipate how the (audio) interaction will sound by simply looking at a static visual diagram. To experience breakdowns, simulations are needed that can serve as representations for mutual understanding by allowing",

Design activities require learning and collaboration. We have developed conceptual frameworks and inno­vative systems that support not only the creation of the artifact but also the professional communities engaged in design as professional practitioners. We have learned from our efforts that older frameworks of edu­cation-associated with notions of instructionism, memorization, and decontextualized learning--cannot be shaken merely by the presence of technology, whether that technology takes the form of intelligent tutoring systems, multimedia, or world-wide connec­tivity. New frameworks must instead be devised to support lifelong learning-learning webs that allow integration of learning, working, and collaborating; en­gagement in authentic problems; self-direction in learn­",

This paper presents a framework for evaluation of computer applications in relation to the new and unique phenomenon of learning: Computer supported collaborative distance learning (CSCdistanceL). The framework may also be considered a means for designing computer applications mediating human actions of collaborative learning. Problem oriented project pedagogy is used as a pedagogical foundation to understand collaborative learning. The crucial aspects of this pedagogical viewpoint are interpreted into dialectical contradictions. The contradictions constitute a basis for understanding the incorporated role of the computer application in the various human actions of collaborative learning.",

This paper is a short version of a paper with the title An analytical framework for evaluation and design of computer applications mediating collaborative distance learning. In this short version, only the basic argumentation and suggestions are described. The empirical basis for the framework is only briefly presented.",
2232,,"The framework has been developed on basis of various studies (over a period of four years and still continuing) of mainly two different learning situations in which com-puter-based applications-based on asynchronous and text-based communication-have a crucial but different role: One learning situation has its foundation in the long tradition of distance education­correspondence education. The pedagogical model is based on an information-transmission paradigm of learning and communication, in such a way that individual production of texts and distribution of these for comments are emphasised. The computer-based",
2233,,,
2234,,application is considered a medium for socialisation in learning situations characterised as highly individual and independent.,
2235,,"The other learning situation has its foundation in a pedagogical viewpoint introduced (in Denmark) by the Danish pedagogue Knud Illeris, who developed what he called an alternative didactic (Illeris, 1974). This pedagogical viewpoint is problem oriented project pedagogy. The fundamental principle is that the students constitute an indivisible community in the collaborative process of analysing a phenomenon in relation to present conditions and problems of society. In contrast to a learning situation analogous to an information-transmission paradigm of communication, the intention has been to integrate a computer application not only to distribute written texts, but to articulate individual contributions and to mediate interaction between the peer-students, to get the whole cooperative work done.",
2236,,"In spite of the two different pedagogical viewpoints, the both learning situations are considered a complex and conflicting frame of computer supported distance learning because of various factors, and the interdependence between them: Pedagogical aspects, technical factors directed towards the limitations and possibilities of avail-able computer applications, administrative and organising factors, factors directed towards design of courses and subject matters, human attitudes, etc. These interconnected factors are crucial to understand CSCdistanceL as a new and unique phenomenon of learning, and indicate that the computer application does not necessarily have the crucial meaning of a successful learning process. However, the signification of available computer applications has most critical pedagogic consequences in learning situations emphasising the students in­terdependency in their work. In such situations, the communication structure presented in the available text-based and asynchronous computer applications constitutes a conflicting frame in relation to the dynamic process of inter-human actions.",

2251,,"2. The Contradiction between Computer­based Applications and Collaborative Learning 
A fundamental requirement of collaborative learning is that a common environment of shared recognition and ex-perience is established (c. f. e. g. Schrage, 1990). Such a community is not created by simply a process of information transmission and distribution (Schrage, 1990, Lave and Wenger, 1991) or assimilation (Piaget, 1950, Illeris, 1974), but in a process in which the students have a certain degree of obligation to each other. The students may have different interests, hold various viewpoints and meanings, and make diverse contributions to the actions. 	However, the participating students need to have a shared under­standing concerning what they are doing and what that means for their individual development process and for the development of the learning community which they are a part of (c.f. Lave and Wenger, 1991).",
2252,,"The primary target group for most distance- and open learning situations, is the adult work force of our society. The student-the adult worker, usually with an established life with family and friends-needs a flexible (further) educational situation free from place-, and often time, constraints. In collaborative learning at distance, a computer application designed for collaborative activities is a fundamental means to create a community of shared experience and recognition. However, such a community is only created if the computer-based application mediates the human actions in such a way that the individual stu­dents do have a feeling of participating in such a community. A basic assumption for this is that the computer-based artefact is incorporated in various human actions varying in relation to the situation at hand. With basis on this assumption, CSCdistanceL must be understood as two incorporated aspects: 1. Human actions directed towards the collaborative learning process, and 2. The computer application.",

2258,,"The text-based and asynchronous communication form presented in most of the available computer applications, represents an information-transmission paradigm of inter-human interactions. Dialogues take place with an analogy to the process of writing, sending and receiving a letter (Sorensen, 1991). Thus, the dynamic and spontaneous nature characterising a dialogue is fundamentally on the premises of the written language. The dialogue lacks the expressive power and interpretative cues resulting from the loss of visual information and feedback opportunities (Eklundh, 1986). In distance learning situations, the written and asynchronous dialogue is the dominating aspect of cooperation, because the students to a large degree do not have any other possibilities to cooperate.",
2259,,"The students report that in a collaborative learning process-based on problem oriented project pedagogy (see next chapter)-it is extremely time consuming and a factor of frustration to carry out inter-human actions directed towards consensus seeking and inter-human conflicts in general, but especially in the fundamental problem formulation phase and in the articulations of each other's contributions to the project (Lpth and Kphler, 1995, c. f. e. g. Georgsen, 1995, Dirckinck­Holmfeld and Fjuk, 1995). The students emphasise that the computer application is a means to support competition and authority, rather as a means to support creativity, mutual respect, tolerance and trust. This may imply a feeling of independence and freedom (Eklundh, 1986), and the students may have a reduced perception of being an active participant in a common learning community (Georgsen, 1995). The feeling of mutual commitment and mutual interdependence, which is essential to create the common learning environment, may not appear in the individual student's mind.",

The students represent an indivisible community that man­age the participants' control, in such a way that they have a shared understanding concerning what they are doing and what that means for the individual learning process and for the development of the collaborative community.

Such an understanding of collaborative learning can be interpreted analogous to what Schmidt (1994) has termed cooperative work: Interdependency in work. Although cooperative work is a collective phenomenon of work, each action is often conducted by an individual actor directed towards a work task. This means that most work tasks are carried out by an individual, but the peer-actors are mutually interdepen­dent in their work (ibid.) in the sense that they need to coordinate and articulate their actions to get the whole work done. In collaborative arrangements, there is a web of actions; informal and formal information ex­change, individual (and sometimes collective) work tasks are discussed, handled, solved, etc. All of these actions are more or less interwoven and incorporated, dependent of the current situation.",

The relationship between tool and medium The dialectical contradiction between (problem­oriented) work tasks and cooperation, are considered fundamental to understand how a computer application should mediate the web of human actions in a collaborative learning community. The dynamic interplay between the web of human actions, implies that a computer application has different roles in different situations. In some situations the application has the mediating role between an individual and her peer-students. In other situations the application has the mediating role between the individual and her work tasks. Thus, the application has to be understood analogous-and as a support to-the contradiction between cooperation and work tasks. The computer application can not simply be understood as a medium for communication (cf. MaaB and Oberquelle, 1990)­information transmission-but as a medium for inter­human interactions and articulation of individual work. The application should also be understood as a tool to",

Interdependency in work is not emphasised. This factor is however crucial in learning situations in which a shared environment for recognition and experience is fundamental. In such situations, the available applications do only mediate a limited part of the whole process of creating and manipulating a collaborative community.",

In a problem-based curriculum, au­thentic problems drawn from clinical practice serve as the stimulus for learning (Barrows, 1994). The method begins with presentation of a problem to a group of students (usually six to eight is considered optimal) and a faculty facilitator known as the ""coach"" (Koschmann et al., 1994). In a setting unaugmented with technol­ogy, the group records their deliberations on a white­board provided for the purpose. The students, relying on their pertinent prior knowledge, attempt to analyze the problem and to identify areas for further individual study. When the group recesses, the students proceed to identify and utilize resources-person, print and elec­tronic-which provide the additional knowledge neces­",

First and foremost was that any computer technologies we de­veloped would have to be useful tools for meeting the learning needs of students who have been underserved by more traditional approaches to school math. Our theories and ideas about how children learn mathemat­ics would inform design decisions and eventually be­come embodied in our software (Bowers, 1988). We wanted to create modeling and simulation environ­ments that would encourage a collaborative kind of mathematics in the classroom. We wanted to test the possible roles that technologies might play in creating a more applications-based and collaborative version of school mathematics. Our belief that learning is a social activity meant that we wanted to create classroom en­vironments where students would become equally en­gaged with each other and mathematics.",
2421,,In this paper we tell a short story of how we con­ceive and design math projects and computer environ­ments. The story highlights two important points about the reciprocity of the MMAP software environments: (1) the computer environments are interactional and mathematical resources in a larger activity structure­the group-based project; and (2) design work students do inside the simulation and modeling environments help to generate opportunities for mathematical activi­ties and student discourse. We outline the premises embedded in our approach to design and describe three software environments and the kinds of mathe­matical engagement they support.,
2422,,"2. Environments for Collaborative Math Learning 
Our view is that mathematics is crucial to everyday living and to current scientific practice. Hence, our materials are designed to reflect that view through a group-based applications approach to learning mathe­matics. Central to our applications project focus is the placing of students in design problems that require the use of mathematics concepts as tools for their solu­tions. By experiencing the utility of applying these concepts as tools, students have a chance to appreciate the power of the mathematics. The students can com­pare and deepen their evolving understanding and mastery of the tools-in-use.",
2423,,"Our charge is to design mathematics learning environments that integrate real-world problem solving, collaborative group work, and material resources that include computer-based tools. MMAP software must help us meet several goals, and our design and development work has evolved continually. From the start the process has been cyclical and iterative. The process relies on cycles consisting of four main activity components: design, prototyping, field testing, and analysis and redesign. The most characteristic feature of the design process is that it is heavily school-based. All development stages are",
2424,,,
2425,,"informed by the real everyday conditions of middle school teachers, students and classrooms. MMAP team members observe and videotape in classrooms and interview teachers and students at each stage of the development process, first to validate application ideas, and then to test prototype designs against desired interaction with mathematics.",
2426,,"When we began development of our first software prototype, ArchiTech©, our criterion was that it had to pass a student engagement test and a math ""yield"" test. After one full year of prototyping and field testing the design environment for creating floor plans, we were able to settle on a design premise that met the engage­ment and math yield criterion. We settled on the idea that the computer environment and the activity envi­ronment needed to become symbiotic; one was only useful and engaging if it was totally interlocked with the other. This was a major departure from the ways we had seen other software for mathematics learning come into development. We do not develop ""mathematics"" software with some suggested activities for their use. We first decide on the kinds of interac­tions and collaborations we want students to have with mathematics, design activities to realize them, and fi­nally, decide whether supports for the interactions are best left in the software or in the classroom activity structures.",
2427,,"These design decisions mean that our software en­vironments are quite consciously not stand-alone in any sense of the term. To complete unit activities a group of students have to use some component of the software, and while using some part of the software, emergent classroom math activities are generated. Us­ing the software is only satisfying in yielding the range of middle school mathematics we expect if the students are engaged in solving particular kinds of problems with corresponding constraints. The computer applica­tions support designing solutions to these problems by providing multiple representations, levels of operation, and analytic opportunities.",
2428,,"Currently, there are three MMAP software envi­ronments. In each technology supported project, groups of students role-play adult occupations: archi­tectural designers (using ArchiTech©), cryptographers and cryptanalysts (using Coding Toolbox©), or biolo­gists and policy designers (using HabiTech©). Each individual plays a role in a group, and each group in class-wide activities. The goal is to create situations where the math can be helpful in solving a common problem, and student conversations and discussions help to bring about new mathematical understandings. The computer simulation tools allow students to im­mediately design solutions to their problem without getting bogged down in unnecessary technical details, computation, or symbolic forms. The environments give students access to multiple representations of their work and information about the different designs they create. The technology also helps students organize",

Learner A may begin by picking out two lines that end with a certain rhyme. Learner B can ascertain A's ac­tivity by watching her work, even though she has not explicitly stated her chosen task. If B during the course of his own tasks comes across another line with the same rhyme, he can pick it out and give it to A, thereby assisting with her part of the task. This moment of collaborative effort is made possible because of work­space awareness, and though small, will be joined by many other similar moments of opportunistic collabo­ration.

In some collaborative learning situations, students work on the same low-level tasks, and focus on a small set of common objects. These situations involve close interaction and require awareness of the precise loca­tion and exact actions of other learners. For example, group creative writing involves partners who discuss and collaborate on each word and phrase of a poem; they need to know the exact context in which to inter­pret the other's comments and contributions. Peer edit­ing is similar, where two students carry on a detailed discussion about a piece of writing. This activity illus­trates the importance of supporting gestural communi­cation-the two learners will use their text as a conver­sational prop, indicating pieces of text and possible changes by pointing and gesturing. Another example involves exploration and problem-solving in a physics microworld, where students work at the same task level, take part in each decision and action, and discuss the changes they see [7].",

Engineering is a classic example of (a) a design do­main [13) which implies a set of problems for learning and (b) a complex domain in which it is difficult to learn and perform [ 15). Learning engineering means developing understanding in a wide variety of concep­tual domains (e.g., physics, behavior of materials, mathematics) while also developing expertise in prob­lem understanding, problem-solving, and integrating diverse conceptual domains [12). Adding to this al­ready large load, engineering educators are now calling for more relevance of educational programs to actual practice - for example, emphasizing collaboration skills because of the increased use of engineering teams in the workplace [l, 2, 7).",

2628,,NoteBase: The core of CaMILE is a collaborative NoteBase where students can post multimedia notes in group discussions. The NoteBase uses a simple struc­ture for multimedia composition called a Media Mar­gin [6]. Student notes in the NoteBase contain text on the left two-thirds of the document and multimedia an­notations appear as icons in the margin in the rightmost third. Students can directly manipulate the icons so that a media reference appears next to corresponding text.,

This paper reports on a case study that was carried out to investigate small-group collaborative learning through real-time remote communication technologies. The aim of the study was to develop insight into rela­tionships between technology characteristics and col­laborative learning that may help in making technol­ogy selection decisions. In this study, audio-conferenc­ing plus a shared workspace led to equal task perfor­mance as audio-conferencing without such an additional tool. However, adding a shared workspace to an audio­conferencing setting may lead to less equal participa­tion, and participants' reportings indicated it may have a negative effect on the amount of effort learners put into the task performance. In contrast, audio-conferenc­ing only seems to lead to more effort by all partici­pants. Effort may be positively related to mental pro­cessing and learning, which leads to hypothetical tech­nology selection guidelines.",

Collaborative distance learning is an emerging area of particular relevance to professional learning/working settings. We view collaborative distance learning as lo­cated in the intersection area of computer-supported col­laborative learning (CSCL) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) [1]. We try to build on tools, findings and perspectives from both areas, thereby pulling CSCL and CSCW together [4].",
2665,,"The present study is an exploratory investigation into relationships between collaborative distance learn­ing processes and technology that may support these, hoping to obtain insights that help make technology selection decisions. Our perspective of collaborative distance learning processes is an educational one. We",
2666,,,
2667,,"work from a social-constructivist assumption of the usefulness of small-group learning settings [e.g., 7], and aim at long-term higher-level learning. To this we apply telecommunications applications for real-time communication that have been a focus in CSCW re­search on supporting collaborative design. In particular, we focus on adding a 'shared workspace' [2, 10] on learners' computer screens to audio-conferencing. (The resulting tools and methods are somewhat similar to audio-conferencing and audio-graphics as have been used for years in distance education settings, but their use --for true collaboration, not for instruction-- and thus their design is different.) 
	Two theoretical notions guide us. The first is from McGrath and Hollingshead [5, 6] who suggested a task/media fit hypothesis: the more complex the task in terms of interdependency of participants, the higher the information richness provided by the technology should be. The second notion is Salomon's [8] 'amount of invested mental effort'. Salomon suggested that a learner invests more mental effort in doing a task through a certain medium if s/he thinks this is difficult (but within a feasible range), and that this extra effort may lead to more learning.",

This facilitated a positive group feeling. This group feeling was also influenced positively by the ef­fect of telepresence that was created by seeing each other type, draw, or gesture (with the mouse pointer) in the shared workspace. Note-taking by only one partici­pant at a time was sufficient; this utilization of effort and time was perceived efficient. However, it did not require all participants to be as actively involved as they were in the audio-only sessions. As a result, the participant who had written most of the group notes felt satisfied over the group's performance, as a result of her active involvement, the efficient task perfor­mance, and the feeling of having been part of a close group. The other two participants were satisfied over the group's performance because they had only put in as much effort as was necessarily required and had been working efficiently overall, and as they had felt a close group while working on a shared product. However, they were less satisfied over their own involvement in what they agreed was meant to be a learning task for all.",
2680,,"In sum, audio-only facilitated effective task per­formance through equal, active involvement and more effort by all. Audio + shared workspace enabled effec­tiveness without too much effort, by efficiency through inequal involvement.",
2681,,"5. 	Discussion 
We conclude that collaborative distance learning can be as effective and satisfactory as face-to-face group learn­ing. Deciding between audio-conferencing with or without a shared workspace, for non-visual tasks, seems a delicate issue however.",
2682,,"5.1. 	Task/media fit 
McGrath and Hollingshead's [5, 6] task/media fit hy­pothesis is based on information richness in terms of social clues: the more complex the task in terms of in­terdependency of participants, the richer the information transmitted by the technology should be. Less complex tasks are for example brainstorming, which can be done collaboratively through text. More complex tasks in­volve coordination or conflict resolution, and require communication of (more) socially rich information such as evaluative and emotional messages in order to sufficiently reduce equivocality. Providing a group with a too 'lean' technology that would not be able to transmit sufficiently rich information to carry out the task would lead to effectiveness losses. A too rich medium, however, would distract the group by trans­mitting meaning that is non-essential for effective task performance, and thus lead to efficiency losses.",
2683,,"In our study both technologies used appeared to al­low an effective fit. However, we did not find that",
2684,,,
2685,,"adding a shared workspace led to efficiency losses. Most of the extra information richness the shared workspace offered, such as gesturing with the mouse pointer and visibility of the dynamics of others' editing on the screen, was found useful for coordination and keeping a shared focus. In the audio-only sessions, however, the participants were able to compensate for the lack of this richness. It seems that McGrath and Hollingshead's task/media fit hypothesis allows some 'freedom of movement' with respect to what is effective and efficient. Human adaptation capabilities and actual effort to compensate allow different patterns of factors to work equally effective and efficient.",
2686,,"5.2. 	Effort 
Effort thus appears to be a key factor: audio-only re­quires more effort than audio plus a shared workspace to achieve the same level of task performance. Sa­lomon [8] found that high perceived task/media de­mands led to high mental effort if they were within the range of perceived self-efficacy with regard to these de­mands. Audio-only was indeed perceived to be more dif­ficult than audio + shared workspace; as the partici­pants felt and appeared to be able to meet the require­ments, they invested an appropriate extra amount of ef­fort in their task performance.",
2687,,Effort is often related to learning in that more ef­fort would lead to deeper mental processing and thus to more learning [8]. From that we could recommend that for learning purposes audio-conferencing only should be preferred over audio plus a shared workspace (while the latter could be a better choice when task-related effi­ciency is merely aimed at). This recommendation should be restricted to learners with appropriate mental skills to compensate for the lack of information rich­ness a shared workspace would offer.,
2688,,"6. 	Conclusion 
From this study we conclude that collaborative learning over a distance can be as effective and satisfactory as face-to-face. For people with adequate listening and structuring skills in learning situations, audio-confer­encing would be preferred over audio-conferencing with a shared workspace, because it requires and stimulates more mental processing.",
2689,,"The insights gained in this study allow us to spec­ulate about a refinement of McGrath and Hollingshead's [5, 6] task/media fit hypothesis, using Salomon's [8] 'amount of invested mental effort' concept: mental ef­fort allows some degree of freedom in task/media fit. This leads us to the following hypotheses with regard to providing media richness for learning:",

The purpose of this paper is to identify some of the characteristics of community-building discourse: the language forms that mediate the creation and nurturance of community in a Listserver context of communica­tion; and the functions of this sort of action. Findings are derived from a three year ethnographic study of an international, 400 member group of academics who communicated with each other using ListServer tech­nology on ten, subsequently five electronic mailing lists. Using Soviet Activity Theory and a Conversation for Action discursive model of communication to make sense of the flow of on-line communication, three re­current patterns of communicative activity were identi­fied as constitutive, though irreducible, to what was termed electronic academia. These patterns of commu­nication were referred to as academic, administrative and community-building action, one of which is succinctly illustrated and discussed here. Characteristic features of community-buildingdiscourse selectively included here are naming the community; and civil language uses (i.e. warm and playful; grateful and positive uses). Functions of community-building action briefly pre­sented are growth and continuity. Together, mediating functions and features of community-building are seen as foundation for productivity and conceptual change.",

.This study builds both theoretically and method­ologically on a number of pioneering studies of CmC (Computer Mediated Communication). Theoretically it builds on studies that have taken CmC as an object of inquiry (e.g.; Black et. al, 1983; Duranti, 1986).",
2707,,,
2708,,"Methodologically, it builds on studies that have taken an ethnographic approach to the study of this phe­nomenon (Murray, 1991). This study is different, how­ever, in at least one important way. It is different be­cause the starting point is no longer the same as it was ten years ago. Ten years ago, the study of CmC needed to be constructed as an object of inquiry in its own right. CmC researchers were motivated to identify both the linguistic (Ferrara et. al, 1991; Murray, 1991a; Wilkins, 1991) and psycho-social features (Keisler et.al, 1984) proper to CmC; different from and common to both oral-aural and written modes of communication. With hindsight, and the current popu­lar explosion of telecommunication usage (Calcari, 1994; Quaterman, 1994;) , I have taken for granted these important concerns (i.e.; that CmC exists as a phenomenon both different and similar to other forms of communication) as well as the answers found to these questions. I was motivated by a desire to make sense of massive volumes of occurring CmC commu­nication (e.g.; ""the size of Montana"" , Swaine, 1995) , and in particular what is accomplished by such forms of communication in a small domain of the Cyber­world (i.e.; what an international group of academic users are doing-in-the-world via CmC). Finally, be­cause ListServer usage offers a world that comes to life exclusively in language use, I was motivated to explore the relationship between language use and ac­tivity; the nature of this micro-world; how it is that it is created; by what means; for what purposes; and to what ends.",

Inter­view and survey procedures entered into an early (first year) cycle of analytical induction functioning as an initial incursion into the community. It turned out, however, that old-timer interviewees supplied me with invaluable insights; and significantly, that several sur­vey respondents were from the silent (lurking) majority supplying me with an illuminating picture of this ac­tivity. In turn, this prompted me to post a small anal­ysis of survey results on-line.

For the de­gree to which they are successful in enabling commu­nication is a vital condition of productivity, and in this particular case for the making and diffusion of knowl­edge. This is to say that where community is truly successful, the flow of on-line communication is both source and outlet for activity. In tum, the principle of community can be used to inform the design of telecommunications technology in different domains of professional activity (e.g.; for teachers as in the LabNet project -DiMauro and Jacobs, 1995).",

The first course is intended to expose the students to a framework in which questions about sustainability can be posed. This framework is based on four dimensions of sustainability: technology, economics, ecology, and ethics (Stan Carpenter, personal communication 1994). The second course in the sequence will employ this background to focus on a series of case studies using a problem-based-learning (PBL) approach [2J.

2803,,"1.1. Problem-based Leaming 
Problem-based learning is a student-centered, contex­tualized approach to schooling. In this approach, learn­ing begins with a problem to be solved rather than con­tent to be mastered. This is consistent with new models of teaching and learning that suggest the emphasis of instruction needs to shift from teaching as knowledge transmission to less teacher-dependent learning. Learning needs to occur in problem-oriented situations if it is to be available for later use in those contexts [3J. PBL was originally developed to help medical students learn the basic biomedical sciences [2J. PBL includes among its goals: (1) developing scientific understand­ing through real-world cases (2) developing reasoning strategies, and (3) developing self-directed learning strategies. Since its origin in medical education, PBL has been used in other settings such as engineering and architecture [4J.",
2804,,"As students articulate and reflect upon their knowledge in PBL, they develop more coherent un­derstandings of the problem space [SJ. In addition, the acquisition and indexing of examples that occurs dur­ing PBL should allow later problems to be solved by case-based reasoning [6J. Finally, the active learning used in PBL should promote the self-directed learning strategies and attitudes needed for lifelong learning [7J. The self-directed learning objectives of PBL are par­ticularly important in science and engineering because PBL may facilitate development of the lifelong learn­ing strategies necessary to stay current in the face of rapid technological advances. The use of PBL requires",

This makes collaboration outside class difficult. Moreover, in the limited amount of time in class, the students do not have sufficient time to reflect. For these two reasons, we felt that a computer-supported collaborative learning environment would help make our PBL course more effective. The next section of the paper will discuss the technological tool we are using to support the students' collaboration, reflection, and learning.",
2807,,"1.2 Technology for collaboration and reflection Collaborative learning is a key part of the PBL ap­proach. As students articulate and reflect upon their knowledge, learning and transfer are facilitated [8J. Group problem-solving allows students to tackle more complex problems than they could on their own. Stu­dents do not necessarily collaborate well nor do they necessarily take opportunities for reflection [9J. The techniques that teachers use to support students engag­ing in an activity and learning skills are called scaffold­ing [lOJ. The goal of scaffolding is (1) to enable stu­dents to carry out a reasoning process or achieve a goal that they would not be able to do without help and (2) to facilitate learning to achieve the goal without sup­port. As students learn the skill, they need less support, so the scaffolding can be faded. Research on software­realized scaffolding shows that some of the help tradi­tionally given by individual coaches can be provided through software [ 1 OJ.",
2808,,"The major tool we use to support collaboration is CaMILE, an interactive, distributed, collaboration en­vironment that scaffolds learning, reflection, access to materials, and problem-solving tools [1 lJ This envi­ronment supports collaboration through the NoteBase in which students enter comments of various types. Students reflect on their thinking as they choose the type of note they enter. The students can attach docu­ments of various forms to the their notes and can create links to the MediaBase, a multimedia repository of additional information, and to resources on the World Wide Web.",
2809,,"CaMILE provides software-realized scaffolding by the use of procedural facilitation. Procedural facili­tation in CaMILE encourages students to think about the role their contribution is making to the problem­solving process itself. Students use this environment as a tool at times when they need to collaborate to com­plete a project and when it is integral to an assignment. When students click on the attached documents the document and its application is opened allowing stu­dents to work collaboratively on shared documents. By encouraging reflection as students collaborate, the stu­dents are more likely to construct usable knowledge and to transfer what they have learned to other prob­lem-solving situations. [8J",

The author proposes to use existing technology and in­formation, to begin a CIN (Collaborative Information Network) at the university of Alberta. Then once the network is established it will be opened up to the In­",

Initial searches of the university li­brary and Internet, indicate that the best general Cana­dian source of information on International Careers and Employment is a newly released second edition of a book. This book has good indexes to selected bibli­ographies and organizations. These indexes, bibliogra­phies, and organizational lists could serve as foundation indexes and lists for new information. All biblio­graphic information in the book is recommended, most items have been reviewed and some items are desig­nated as ""editor's choice"". This recommendation and review process can be used as a model for future addi­",

2868,,the book on line is intellectual property rights. This concern needs to be carefully considered by W3 [5] and CIN developers.,
2869,,"Another source of foundational information is ex­isting information on Internet. An initial search found several job services, one of which was international in scope and has been linked to the W3 pages of the In­ternational Center at the University.",
2870,,"In addition to an information foundation, a CIN needs a people foundation. To lay this foundation, the author is recruiting people interested in the topic to be CIN editors. This can involve three types of activities: creating new information, adding new information and updating existing information. It is hoped that these activities will provide a ""collaborative filtering"" [6] of information according to its usefulness to other users. The International Center at the university has already put their information on Internet and others are consid­ering doing this. It is anticipated that each W3 page will have an editor responsible for the content. Once this foundation of editors and an information structure is in place the network can be opened up to others and",

This would be done by sending email messages to an editor. Other items of informa­tion may have already been identified. One such item is an ""International Career Quotient"" test. This test provides a good overview of ones preparedness for an international career. It could also be used as an index to information especially for items on which one",

Another way of finding additional information is the collabora­tive analysis of cooperative searches [7].,
2875,,"Another source of information is user comments and information from newsgroups. An initial search of ""job"" newsgroups, did not find any newsgroups dedi­cated to international employment. Separate sections of the bibliographic index could be used for comments from users and newsgroups.

2876,,"Another way of expanding the network would be to develop ""instructional networks"" for students study­ing subjects related to international careers and em­ployment. In an instructional network information could be indexed according to topics listed in the course outline. Each student could be assigned to edit a spe­cific topic. Students could conduct searches, which could be added to the network through student editors. Teachers (Professors, Instructors) could then edit the students work for the next class of students. They could also pass the information on to an appropriate ed­itor from the broader International Career and Em­ployment CIN.

In July 1993 E-GEMS researchers set up an exhibit at Science World to observe children as they interacted with video games and computer games. During the two month exhibit, over ten thousand children spent time in the exhibit and several hundred children were interviewed by researchers. Two strong themes that emerged from our observations were the popularity of collaborative play and differences in gender preferences and playing styles. Gender differences are reported in detail else­where [6,10]. This paper presents the outcomes of a two-phase further investigation of collaborative play conducted in a school classroom in January 1994 and at Science World in the summer of 1994.",

3121,,"2.1. 	Cooperation task 
The task that is used to study the relation between in­formation exchange and information processing during cooperative problem solving is called the ""Camp Puz­zle"". It is meant for students from the highest grades of elementary school (10-12 years old). The Camp Puzzle may be compared to the so-called ""Smith, Jones and Robinson"" problems. In this kind of logical problems one has to combine different statements of information in order to derive some characteristics of a specified group of individuals. However, in the Camp Puzzle this task information has been split (in two 'letters' of children in this group) and has been distributed among the two cooperating partners. By this splitting of in­formation cooperation becomes necessary in order to complete the task. The students have to infer several characteristics of the six children mentioned in the task. Each of the two partners receives a letter which con­tains different information about the children mentioned in the task.",
3122,,"2.2. 	Cooperation dialogues 
In two research projects the Camp Puzzle was assigned to couples of students in the highest grade of elemen­tary school (72 and 20 couples). Their task-dialogues were collected on video or audio tapes. By means of a comprehensive system the utterances in the dialogues could be coded along three main characteristics: content (in the form of a proposition), dialogue-act and illocu­tion. The dialogue-act represents the communicative ac­tion of an utterance, for example: question, proposal, denial, statement, etc. The illocution part of an utter­ance provides the listener explicit information on how to interpret the information transferred. In most cases the illocution concerns the certainty of the information, for instance ""I am not sure that.."".",
3123,,"From analyses of the cooperative task-dialogues, it was learned that mutual coordination and communica­tion of relevant information and inferences during �o­operative problem solving is a complex intertwined and dynamically changing process. The topical structure in the argumentative dialogues coincide with the sub­problem structure of the task. However, the sequence of sub-problems is not rigid and a solution path has to be found. For this purpose, topics have to be initiated, tried and evaluated in the ongoing dialogue. Remark­ably, topics are seldom explicitly proposed, but are ini­tiated implicitly by exchanging relevant information concerning a topic.",
3124,,"Most of the dialogue-acts in the Camp Puzzle are informative, supportive or argumentative. Contrary to what one would expect, the dialogues contain very few",
3125,,"open questions (e.g. ""Do you know the sports of Jan ?""). The students seem to hold on to another Coopera­tive Principle (compare Grice, [6]): ""If my partner has",
3126,,"found something interesting, he will tell me, I don't have to ask for it!"". Yes/No questions are found more",
3127,,"frequently (e.g. ""Does Jan play volleyball?""). These lat-",
3128,,,
3129,,"ter type of questions function, mostly, to check infor­mation exchanged. Furthermore, the students are very concerned with the plausibility or certainty of the propositions transferred or inferred by themselves or by",
3130,,"their partners (25% of the utterances have an explicit il­locution part). Several plausibility levels (five in our model) can be distinguished, depending on the source of",
3131,,information and on the depth and complexity of the in­ference procedure.,
3132,,"2.3. Dialogue Monitor 
Based on analysis of the dialogue protocols a prototype of a Dialogue Monitor for a cooperative system was developed, simulating a cooperative student. The 'Dia­logue Monitor' program has been experimentally used with 51 students (10-12 years) of two elementary schools. The architecture model advanced in this pro­gram will be used for further development of 'intelligent' computer-based cooperative systems. In the model of the Dialogue Monitor five components,",
3133,,"functioning as separate modules, may be distinguished.",
3134,,"The 'Problem Solving Component' contains knowledge about the content of the task and its domain and is able to apply inference procedures in order to solve this type of problems. The 'Dialogue Processor' contains expertise about interaction processes in gen­eral and has strategies for generating communicative ac­tions: i.e. argumentative, supporting and eliciting sce­nario's. In the 'Alter Component' a discourse history is been updated in the ongoing dialogue. Based on this history a belief-system about the current activities of the partner is construed.",
3135,,The 'Central Focusing Processor' contains the co­operation strategies. The general task of the Central Focusing Processor is to interpret and check incoming utterances of the partner and to generate utterances itself in a reacting or initiating way. The communication with the program takes place with the 'Menu-Based 'natural language' Interface'. By means of interconnected menu's the student can select constituents of the utter­ance he/she wants to make [9]. The selections made by the student are translated into a grammatically correct sentence. With the interface a large amount of different sentences can be made (about 3.2 million).,

3181,,"leagues have consistently shown through over a decade of research on peer interactions in computer-based and non-computer-based settings, ""students learn more by giving elaborated help to others and learn less by re­ceiving low-level elaboration from others"" (Webb & Farrivar, 1993). However, unelaborated explanations or ""terminal responses"" are more typical of student re­sponses than are such ""high quality explanations""-at least among school-aged children (e.g., Webb, 1989). Not surprisingly, research by King (1989) shows that another important interaction skill which students often lack is the ability to ask questions which evoke elabo­rated explanations.",
3182,,"The results of this research on the relation between the nature of peer interactions and learning are impor­tant for developers of CSCL systems, because they suggest that these systems should scaffold the produc­tion of high-level questions and elaborated explana­tions. However, the research done to date is weak in accounting for when and how-i.e., in what contexts­peer question-asking and explanation failures occur. Various issues need to be addressed in order to tailor advice in CSCL systems according to the advising ca­pabilities of the target users, such as: Are students uniformly and consistently poor at giving explana­tions, or do they tend to explain some types of knowl­edge more readily than other types-e.g., procedural knowledge as opposed to conceptual or strate­gic/planning knowledge? To what extent are explana­tion failures correlated with (and perhaps indicative of) knowledge gaps? As knowledge and skill in the task domain increases, does the quality of explanations (and questions) improve? How do collaborating peers use the various information and advising resources avail­able to them in a learning environment? How do hu­man mentors scaffold collaborating students during im­passes-e.g., when is mentors' support directive; when is it more dialectical? 	With these research issues in mind, we observed and videotaped students as they worked together on Sherlock II (e.g., Lesgold et al., 1992), a computer-based, coached practice environment developed to train U.S. Air Force avionics technicians to diagnose electronic faults in F15 aircraft modules and in the complex testing systems used to check out these modules. Our principle aims in this pilot study are to: (1) capture the nature of peer learning interac­tions in this problem-solving domain, in terms of the issues raised above, (2) determine the extent to which the findings derived from this analysis could inform the development of effective advising capabilities in a col­laborative version of Sherlock II, and (3) assess the effectiveness of our research methodology for accom­plishing the preceding objectives. The data collection phase of the study is completed, and we have started to analyze the data. In this paper, we describe the pilot study and the data that it has yielded.",
3183,,,
3184,,2. 	Description of the Pilot Study,
3185,,"2.1. 	Research Context 
Like its predecessor, Sherlock, Sherlock II is a coached practice environment. It provides a realistic computer simulation of the actual job environment, al­lowing students to make measurements, interpret read­ings, replace suspect components with shop standards, etc., until they have isolated the faulty component. Students thus acquire and practice skills in a context similar to the real context in which they will be used. Advice is available ""on demand"" throughout problem solving. After solving a problem, students enter a re­view phase which we call Reflective Follow-up (RFU). During RFU, students can step through their solution with feedback from the computer coach, ask to see a sample expert solution, get advice for their next ses­sion, and review the standards of effective troubleshoot­ing. In other words, RFU ""debriefs"" students on their performance.",
3186,,"2.2. 	Subjects 
Three groups of people participated in this pilot study of peer interaction in a coached practice environment. First, eight experienced avionics technicians from local (Pittsburgh-based) Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units served as mentors. Among these men­tors, on-the-job experience in avionics ranged from three to twenty years (7.5 years was the mean). The second group of participants consisted of 16 avionics students (forming eight dyads) from two local avionics technical schools. All but three avionics students were in their final term of a six-term program; the other three were in their fifth term. Finally, four Air Force ROTC students (forming two dyads) also served as sub­jects. All eight mentors, and all but two of the twenty students, were male. Subjects volunteered to partici­pate, and were payed a nominal amount.",
3187,,"2.3. 	Procedure 
Following an orientation to the Sherlock II task domain and practice with using the tutor, all but two of the ten dyads were assigned to a mentor, who worked with the same dyad for one two-hour session per week. All dyads worked on the same set of Sherlock II problems, in the same order. There were two phases of data collection. In the first phase, students worked to·· gether at the same computer, doing one or two prob­lems per session. One student was assigned the role of problem solver; the other student was assigned the role of ""coach."" These roles were reversed for each succes­sive problem, in reciprocal teaching fashion (Palincsar & Brown, 1984). Students were directed to ask their peer for advice first, to use Sherlock (the computer coach) if their peer could not answer their question ( or answer it adequately), and to ask the human mentor if",

3237,,"The study is being conducted in the classrooms of four teachers in four different schools, three in Van­couver and one in Kingston, Ontario. The teachers (and their schools) were chosen to have some characteristics in common, and to differ in others. Their common characteristics include a commitment to collaborative learning, an interest in participating in research pro­jects, and a reputation as being a good teacher. The teachers differ dramatically in their length of time in teaching (from 4 to 24 years), their comfort in using computers (from computer-phobe to computer-lover), and in their approach to teaching mathematics (from primarily textbook-based to virtually no use of a text­",
3238,,"book at all). Their classes also differ in many respects: grade level (from grade 3-4 to grade 7-8), socio-eco­nomic status, proficiency in English language (ESL, French immersion, fluent).",
3239,,"The study began in mid-March of 94 with the placement of four LC III Macintosh computers in each classroom. The computers were equipped with a fairly limited selection of software: a word processor and paint program designed for children (Microsoft's Cre­ative Writer and Fine Artist), Hypercard, and E-GEMS prototype games. CD-ROM drives were gradually added, together with a small number of commercial electronic games (The Incredible Machine by Sierra Dynamix, Counting on Frank by EA*Kids). Each teacher established a schedule for the students to use the computer, and encouraged the students to keep a journal of their experiences in using the computer. Be­cause of our interest in collaborative use of computers, the schedules were designed to allow 6-8 students ac­cess to the 4 computers at once. In some classrooms students also use the computers during ""free-time"": re­cess, lunch, and before and after school.",
3240,,"Each classroom was assigned an E-GEMS univer­sity researcher to visit the classroom weekly for one to two hours. During such visits the researcher's activities include observing the students using the computers, interviewing students, and participating in discussions with the whole class about the electronic games and other activities. The Vancouver teachers also partici­pate in monthly meetings, where the teachers and their university partners get together to share their experi­ences, and to help advise on other E-GEMS research efforts.",
3241,,"2. Students As Researchers 
The E-GEMS teachers have used a variety of strategies to emphasize the ""student as researcher"" approach. We have found this approach to be particularly effective in engaging students' interest in using the computers. When the ""student as researcher"" emphasis is not pre­sent in a classroom for a few weeks, as has occurred in",
3242,,"each classroom for a variety for reasons, many students",
3243,,,
3244,,"ignore the computers during that time. We consistently find that students choose to play the games that they are guided to play, and the games that are mediated. As",
3245,,"others before us have observed, a computer put into a classroom is not a magical thing. It will not, by itself, attract students to the world of learning, or even to the world of games.",
3246,,"In Eileen's classroom, the students are introduced to their role as researchers early in the year. The major research formats used are journal keeping, sign-up charts, tally charts of games played, maintaining ""bug"" sheets, and weekly class debriefing/sharing sessions. Journal entries serve several purposes. They give a clear record of what activities the students are engaging in; they also let us see whether students are static or changing in their choice of partners. From their writing we learn how students interact with the computers and each other, from how they delegate control of the mouse to what they learn from each other.",
3247,,"The sign-up charts ensure that all students have ac­cess to the computers each week. Students sign-up for two periods weekly. This sign-up has been done three times during the course of the year to promote different student groupings. Journal entries and tallying of activ­ities are made in conjunction with sign-up times. The bug sheets are used to record problems the students find in the E-GEMS prototype games. These prototypes are placed in the classrooms beginning in very early stages of development. The university researchers re­sponsible for prototype development then visit the classroom regularly to discuss the games with the stu­dents, pickup the bug sheets, and install the latest ver­sions. The students love their role as bug-finders and expert critics. They quickly learn the value of making detailed observations when a problem occurs. They also see they are genuinely respected as researchers.",
3248,,"One of the most effective strategies we have found is the holding of regular whole class debriefing/sharing discussions. In Eileen's classroom the initiation of these meetings marked a significant change in student attitudes. Once regular recording and sharing of ideas was expected, the students started to really listen to each other, to write more detailed comments about their findings, and to think not only about what they were doing, but also about what they were learning. For us, this is of crucial importance. Like many teach­ers, Eileen is particularly interested in methods that provide her with windows into students' thinking. Her class is very good at verbalizing their ideas. They are",
3249,,"often onerous to have to write things that are so much weaker at written discourse. For Grade 4 students, it is",
3250,,"more easily shared orally. However, writing about computer research, although not everybody's favorite, is something that they all do.",
3251,,"Recently, when Eileen asked her class to tell her what they knew about being researchers, two ideas kept corning up. ""Research is hard and research is fun."" At",

Most educators believe that teachers who learn to work",

This strategy has proven effective within team competitions where it was found that a case scenario provides a rare opportunity for profes­sional collaboration for solving real-life problems (McNergney, Herbert, and Kent, in press). Ellsworth (1994) explains that collaborative-learning students take on a more active role in the learning process. They become problem-solvers, contributors and dis­cussants. Collaborative learning situations also in­",
3291,,"crease cross-cultural awareness, increased interest, fo­cus and synthesis (Ellsworth, 1994).",
3292,,"Cases have been used as the basis for competitions in which judges evaluate analyses presented by collab­orative teams of student teachers from different institu­tions (McNergney, Herbert, and Ford, 1993). Such competitions allow participants to work collaboratively within the framework of a given system of procedures, an environment not unlike the professional workplace. Professionals maintain their status and social worth be­cause they possess knowledge that others do not, and case competitions explicitly encourage the integration of professional knowledge and practice--knowledge of both ""knowing"" and ""knowing how"" (McNergney, Herbert, and Kent, in press).",
3293,,"Virtual competitions have been held over the In­ternet via mailing lists, e-mail, and through text and graphical presentations on the World Wide Web (WWW or Web for short). One such competition in­volved five teams of student teachers from three coun­tries. Virtual competitions hold a tremendous advan­tage over live competitions in their cost effectiveness in regard to both time and money. Additionally, virtual competitions allow greater flexibility in bringing to­gether a wide range of individuals and cultures for in­teraction in a common collaborative setting (McNergney, Herbert, and Kent, in press).",
3294,,"E-mail and Web technologies, however, are not real-time events. We hope to use the MOO (MUD, Object Oriented; where MUD stands for Multi-User Dimension) environment to capture the collaborative nature of a ""live"" competition using technology that lets us conduct real-time case competitions that allow international participation for very little expense.",

Educators have become interested in the utility of rapidly developing electronic networks to support seri­ous, systemic reform in the nation's schools (Means, 1994). Educational reformers see opportunities for",

3462,,"technology to support standards based educational goals (Means, 1994 ), to assist with innovative assessment (Sheingold and Erikson, 1994), to enhance teacher preparation (Barron and Goldman, 1994 ), and to scaf­fold learning for at-risk students (Cognition and Tech­nology Group, 1994). However optimistic may be the promise of technology to support reform, researchers have also noted problems implementing innovative technological approaches that effectively promote sys­temic reform. A common problem is that technology can be used to maintain the status quo, in the service of traditional or less effective educational approaches (Newman, 1994). One factor that is crucial to the effec­tive use of technology for reform is professional devel­opment that integrates technology (U.S. Office of Technology Assessment, 1995).",

But quantity of interaction does not necessarily imply quality (Harasim, 1990). This fact may be crucial to online professional development activity. Professional devel­opment that aims to change practice according to new teaching standards may need to engage teachers in a more intensive, structured milieu of professional com­munity and intellectual teamwork (Gallegher & Kraut 1991) than is currently possible.",

The 1990 Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) re­quires a major upgrading and installation of desk!op �nd network technology in the 176 school d1stncts throughout the state. The Kentucky Master Plan for Technology designates the Kentucky Education Tech­nology System (KETS) as the integrated wide-area network that will connect school districts, the states' colleges and universities, and its government agencies. As Kentucky schools come on-line, it will be critical that viable uses of the network exist to accommodate the professional needs of teachers -- teachers who will be expected to engage in new types of teaching (e.g., non-graded primary instruction and portfolio assess­ment) and problem-solving activities vastly different from those they may have learned in their previous pro­fessional preparation. The case method as we have pro­",

This accomplishes two important ob­jectives: a) the creation of much richer cases that can include audio and video enhancement as well as student artifacts and b) the capability for every teacher in Ken­tucky to access case discussions electr�nically us�ng CASENET. One of our primary goals m developmg CD-ROM cases is to render highly engaging narratives of equal value to both beginning and experienced teach­ers. In this way, cases become the vehicle for a shared experience and subsequent conversation (Bli�s � Mazur, in press).

Six experienced history teachers (ranging from 18 to 29 years in the classroom) in Shelby County, Kentucky each individually studied the CD-ROM version of a case entitled ""When Is Enough, Enough?"" the story of award-winning high school teacher, Elaine Temkin (Bliss, in press). Mrs. Temkin teaches U.S. history thematically to provide a frame of reference for chrono­logical events. She begins her course with a unit on the Vietnam war and uses primary source materials and cooperative learning extensively. The story focuses on the way she motivates a low achieving student, Mark, who wants to transfer to a less demanding course. After each of the six teachers had the opportunity to study the case, they met as a group for a two and a half-hour facilitated case discussion. The final activity in was a videoconference with a student teacher at the university. After the entire professional development sequence the veterans participated in a one hour focus group debrief­ing regarding their experiences. The researchers partici­pated as observers. The Shelby County teachers re­ceived professional development credit for participation in the case sequence of individualized study, group dis­cussion, and video conferencing with student teachers.",

Throughout the initial CASENET field test, the participants articulated individual views as well as responded to the differing comments of others, an activity that Steeples (1993) notes can lead to re­finement and deeper understanding of concepts. This process of articulation and refinement may also broaden the application of underlying principles (Brown & Palinscar, 1989), a skill which will be crucial to incor­porating new standards and approaches throughout a teaching career.",
3522,,The CD Cases and telecommunications tools pro­vided several conditions to support these interactions:,
3523,,"•	A shared context for discussion. Using the mul­	timedia case as a basis for common experience, dif­	ferences in the school contexts and teaching ap­	proach of each teacher could be assimilated into a 	discussion of the specifics of the case. This made 	the experience more relevant and stimulated multi­	ple perspectives on an issue.",
3524,,"•	An emphasis on pedagogy. The true story case 	was believable and included specific issues and 	strategies related to teaching social studies. This 	was motivating and challenging. Teachers, it 	seems, want to talk about teaching and need more 	opportunities to do so.",
3525,,•	Flexible professional development options. The,
3526,,"CD cases were engaging and convenient to use as schedules permitted. This was a key benefit for teachers working around school scheduling. Also, the teachers were free to discuss topics of their",

3528,,"own choosing either in the case discussion or dur­ing the video conference, which fostered ownership of the process. All participants were eager for more cases and contacts with other teachers.",
3529,,"As the participants reported, these conditions con­tributed to a sense of identification and involvement with their own profession, a consequence of on-line collaboration also reported by Steeples (1993). These preliminary data demonstrate how features of the CD­ROM cases and the desktop videoconferencing estab­lished conditions for mutually beneficial professional conversations. These findings are consistent with Har­rington's (1993) work that suggests the potential of computer conferencing to support professional dis­course. Conversations that enthuse teachers about ac­tivities such as mentoring and reflective practice are one vital component of a laming community.",
3530,,"6. Future Directions 
It is clear from this initial investigation that more re­search is needed on the evolution of an electronic com­munity of experienced and novice educators. Can partic­ipation in such a community affect teachers' ability to incorporate new types of pedagogy? For instance, what types of realistic on-line relationships (e.g. mentors, partners, case facilitators) are needed? These initial vet­eran-novice contacts were necessarily brief and superfi­cial. Under what conditions do enduring on-line rela­tionships develop and what tools are needed? In the up­coming year we plan to broaden the scope of case train­ing and CASENET participation. Urban areas and rural",
3531,,"Appalachian districts in cooperation with other teacher preparation programs will be included. These groups will be using the multimedia cases, desktop video con­ferencing, Kentucky's two-way videoconferencing sys­tem 1, as well as e-mail and the Common Thread Case Netscape home page. As we work to develop imple­mentation models and expand participation in CASENET, we will continue to explore the role of technology in creating associations between novice and experienced educators in the midst of reform.",

Designing post graduate professional development dis­tant learning programmes via CSCL requires us to en­sure that the technology does not become the major de­terminant of the programme.

3600,,"rience and knowledge gained, and a new cycle is en­gaged. Action learning and research are ways of dealing with real-life problems and issues. They are ways of both generating new knowledge about something while at the same time trying to change it.",
3601,,"At a meta-level, action learning and research in­form the learners about how they are learning. The constant process of reflecting while learning, which is inherent in the action cycle if carried out thoughtfully, raises issues to do with how the learning is taking place and why, and how it could be made different: """,
3602,,"contemporary forms of action research also aim at mak­ing change and learning a self-generating and self-main­taining process in the systems in which the action re­searchers work"" (Elden and Chisholm 1993).",
3603,,"6. A Supportive Learning Environment One important aspect of the supportive learning envi­ronment is the need to have considerable interaction be­tween members of the groups. Learners must encourage and facilitate each others efforts. This might involve them helping each other, providing feedback, challeng­ing each other, suggesting ways forward, acting in trusting ways and so on. Each member has to feel that they will be supported by the others. This can then produce the conditions for learners to take risks in the learning process, to try out ways of working or think­ing or acting which they consider to be different to ""the norm"", but which might produce novel results or ideas.",
3604,,"A major constraint in interactions is group size. If a group of cooperative learners is too large then the possibility for frequent interaction between all mem­bers will be low. What constitutes a large group in CSCL ? A difficult question to answer. In my experi­ence, anything greater than six or seven is large.",
3605,,"A supportive learning environment does not, how­ever, suggest a lack of challenges. But a challenge in a supportive environment can be received and accepted and dealt with in a different way to a challenge in a non-supportive environment. If learners have a large degree of trust in each other, then challenges will be­come part of the culture of the group and will be seen as productive, if not always comfortable.",
3606,,"Linked to this is the need to work without fear. Where learners do not know each other and where there is little concern for being supportive and cooperative, they will be fearful of taking risks, of sharing and be­ing open. Where there is a cloud of uncertainty in learning relationships, learners will act with caution for fear of ""making fools"" of themselves or ""showing themselves up"". Making CSCL environments safe places to work in can create stimulating, challenging and exciting learning opportunities. Learners and tutors engage in dialogue more freely and openly (McConnell 1994).",
3607,,,
3608,,"7. Collaborative Assessment 
In CSCL, learners have a major role in choosing what they work on for their course assignments. They also have an important part to play in assessing their own",
3609,,and other learners' work. Collaborative assessment is a natural corollary of cooperative learning; it supports the cooperative learning process.,
3610,,"Self and peer assessment are seen as an important, integral part of the preparation for life and work gener­ally ( for example, see (Stephenson and Weil 1992),(Boyd and Cowan 1985). Although by no means",
3611,,"tional and social benefits of such a process. And a re­widespread, there is now a wider belief in the educa­",
3612,,cent survey looking at quantitative self-assessment studies showed that there was considerable consistency,
3613,,"between marks assigned by teachers and students in peer and self-assessment situations (Falchikov and Boud 1989), so dispelling some of the criticism that students are not able to effectively assess themselves and each other.",
3614,,"Research into the relationship between assessment and learning has shown that learners will often choose how to learn, and what to learn, on the basis of their understanding of what is to be assessed, and how it will be assessed. Learners seek cues from staff about what to learn and what is likely to be examined in the course, and work instrumentally to achieve this (Miller and Parlett 1974). What students focus on in their studies, and indeed their whole view of university life, is largely governed by what they think they will be assessed on (Becker, Geer et al. 1968).",
3615,,"The importance of this to cooperative learning and collaborative assessment seems clear. If learners are ac­tively involved in decisions about how to learn and what to learn and why they are learning, and are also actively involved in decisions about criteria for assess­ment and the process of judging their own and others work, then their relationship to their studies will be qualitatively different to those learners who are treated as recipients of teaching and who are the object of oth­ers', unilateral, assessment. Because learners in cooper­ative learning situations make decisions about their learning and assessment, there will be no need for them to seek cues from staff about assessment or seek to find ways of ""playing"" the system. They determine the sys­tem themselves, in negotiation with other learners and staff.",
3616,,"8. Assessment and Evaluation of the Ongoing Learning Processes 
Any ongoing evaluation of the cooperative learning process must be carried out with the learners' knowl­edge that there is a real opportunity to change the de­",
3617,,sign of the learning process.,
3618,,Group processing occurs within the learning community and within each cooperative learning group. By reflecting on the way in which the group is,

3622,,,

3624,,"working, the group will be in a position to change its patterns and relationships in order to better achieve what it is aiming for.",
3625,,Group processing and review are mechanisms for surfacing issues in the effective running of the learning community or cooperative group. They are also ways of promoting learning about working in groups from,
3626,,"an experiential viewpoint. Successful group strategies have to be able to survive, and new varieties have to be able to emerge (Axelrod, 1990).The tutor has to be aware of some of the techniques, models and ways of",
3627,,thinking about working with small groups in order to help the groups review their own processes.,
3628,,"But it is not sufficient just to have management skills, important as they are. What is vital is a real un­derstanding of the purposes of evaluation in the learn­ing community, and a real willingness, especially on the part of the tutor, to be open to change on the basis of reflection on the experiences of everyone involved. This has to be a cooperative effort. If it is seen to be addressing only the tutor's concerns and experiences then it is unlikely to succeed. And if there appears to be significant blockage on making changes then learn­",
3629,,ers will feel dis-empowered.,

The graduate learning activity-referred to as the Case Problems Assignment-requires collaborative concep­tual mapping, problem-identification, and problem­solving. The case problems assignment is the primary task given to students enrolled in a graduate course called ""Alternative Views of Learning"" which enrolls approximately 25 students per term. The course is part of a graduate program in Instructional Systems.",
3688,,"The learning activity begins with the development of cognitive maps. Each week, learning groups met outside of class to discuss articles they have read and to find relations among key terms generated by students from their reading. Using appropriate software in a network environment, each group is responsible for constructing a cognitive map of their combined under­standing that reflects relations among terms. In doing this, each group enters definitions of terms and descrip­tions of links among terms. The cognitive maps are used by students to identify, define, and recommend so-1 utions to authentic problems in the field of instruc­tional systems design.",
3689,,"By mid-semester, after considerable social negotia­tion has resulted in fairly complete cognitve maps, each learning group begins applying its conceptual un­derstandings to an authentic case problem. Some prob­lems are identified by the instructor, who is aware of cases in schools, companies, banks, hospitals, and mu­seums that present particular challenges to conven­tional approaches and might be amenable to analysis by this class. Other case problems are identified by the students themselves, most of whom work part or full time in some sort of training or education capacity. Once the problems have been identified, in consultation with the client, learning groups use their cognitive maps to help define the problem (and sub-problems) represented by the case and to identify relevant literature likely to be helpful in generating a solution. The goal for each learning group is to develop a set of recom­mendations that, if implemented, may solve the prob­lem identified in the case. Students are also to provide a rationale for their recommendations that is grounded in the literature read during the course. The report of each group is submitted to the instructor and to the client.",
3690,,Computer support for the case problems assign­ment includes concept mapping software used in a net­worked environment to support collaboration among group members as they construct cognitive maps.,

3697,,"3. A Theoretical Placement of the As­signments 
The assignments were designed to foster active learning through student-centered instruction (see McCown, Driscoll, & Roop, in press). Student-centered ap­proaches define the teacher as a ""guide on the side""",
3698,,"rather than a ""sage on the stage"" (Johnson & Johnson, 1994). Many student-centered teaching approaches are therefore consistent with constructivist views of learn­ing (Prawat, 1992). There are three benchmarks of constructivism as it is applied to learning (Driscoll, 1994, Marshall, 1992). One constructivist benchmark is that social negotiation is essential to learning. Both assignments clearly rely on social negotiation among learners. For example, the journal publication assign­ment requires each ""editorial board"" to produce a prospectus while the case problems assignment requires intense negotiation in the construction of the group's cognitive map.",
3699,,"Another benchmark is that learning is best done in ""real-life"" environments, complete with the ill-defined problems characteristic of every day situations. In can be argued that the journal publication assignment is",
3700,,,
3701,,"become collaborators, sharing responsibility for deter­mining what is to be learned (Bruffee, 1993). The is­sue of who determines what is to be learned has been used to distinguish cooperative learning from collabora­tive learning (Haring-Smith, 1993, 1994a, 1994b). One approach to collaborative learning is called teach­ing for understanding (Talbert & McLaughlin, 1993). This approach is based on three principles: that knowl­edge is constructed; that the teacher is a guide, a col­laborator in the construction of student knowledge; and that the classroom is a learning community that sup­ports its members. Translated into classroom practice, these principles mean that sometimes topics are gener­ated by students rather than presented by the teacher (Perkins, 1993). Although both assignments are fairly structured in terms of the process by which they are completed, learners have considerable latitude in select­ing the substance of their products. For example, in the journal publication assignment, learners select the classroom project they will descibe in their ""articles"" and in the case problems assignment, learners identify their own clients and the problem they will address for that client.",

Several research programs have documented students' difficulties with learning relative motion. (See [9, 10] for reviews.) Recently, research programs have inves­tigated the use of computer simulations to assist con­ceptual change. (See [4, 7, 8, 14, 15] for reviews.) At SRRI, we identified several relative motion alternative conceptions and have been investigating ways that col­laborative computer simulation activities can assist secondary students in learning relative motion [9, 10].",

They then provided an explanation for any discrepancies between their predictions and their observations.",

However, acl's partner, ac2, did not display substantial gains, scoring 33% on both the pretest and posttest. It is plausible that this was due to insufficient experience with the collaborative simulation activities. Or, the presented activities were not at the appropriate level for her to advance her current conceptions.",
3766,,"5. Mental Model Construction 
We hypothesize that students often construct a mental model of a relative motion problem through parallel construction of a visual model (see [15]) and a numeric model. The generation of the visual model is done by constructing a visual model of the motion of objects, relative to each medium which motion occurs in or on, and coordinating the components. (see [5] for a simi­lar hypothesis.) In parallel with visual model construc­tion, the student may construct a numeric model of components of the problem and combine the numeric components. The visual model and the numeric model are subject to criticism based on a student's epistemo­logical commitments (e.g. the ""true"" velocity of an ob­ject is its velocity relative to the ground (see [12]). If both the visual model and the numeric model pass the epistemological commitment tests, they are combined into a resultant mental model. A clash between the vi­sual and numeric models may cause reconstruction of either model, based on the student's confidence in the models. It is possible, however, that the student will be unconcerned with, unaware of, or unable to resolve inconsistencies between the models. (See [2].)

3775,,"the cruise ship. 	Additionally, it appears that experience with the collaborative computer simulation activities affected the student's visual model of the problem, as she referred to the cruise ship as equivale?t to the still object on the computer screen. This analogous reasoning may indicate improved understanding of the reference frame concept, a necessary prerequisite for accurate mental imagery of the problem. We further hypothesize that critical to, and concurrently developed with her visual model, is her numeric model of the problem. Without an understanding of the numeric information prese�t in the problem, she would be unable to produce a umque visual model of the problem; her visual and numeric models evolve in parallel, we hypothesize.",

We provided preliminary statistical and protocol evi­dence for the efficacy of short, highly constrained, collaborative computer simulation activities for im­proving performance on a measure of relative motion understanding. Thus, collaborative computer simula­tion activities may be able to assist students' learning in difficult domains like relative motion. As evidenced by acl 's performance on relative motion problems which required directional answers (like question 9) and nu­meric answers (like question 7), it appears that simula­tion activities, in which only visual information is pre­sented, can assist students in solving both directional and numeric problems.",

In this paper we present a vision of computer-sup­ported collaborative learning through solving genera­tive problems - problems that promote open-ended in­quiry and have multiple solutions. This vision stems from a novel and evolving approach to collaborative learning that we are developing at the EduTech Insti­tute. This approach is based on the following premises: that learning is facilitated by generative problem solv­ing, collaborative work and use of multiple cases; that learning and skill acquisition need to be, and can be, scaffolded through software; and that a computer envi­ronment which integrates a shared and structured elec­tronic workspace with a full variety of functionalities can effectively support all of the above. We describe this approach and the architecture of the corresponding computer environment. This environment is designed to serve three critical functions: provide a shared workspace for students, facilitate inter- and intra-group collaborative work, and make available the tools and",
3796,,resources that students need for problem solving and learning. The software components of the environment that have already been implemented are described.

3798,,"1. Introduction 
Too often, classroom instruction provides students with many bits of knowledge that they are never able to as­semble and apply in productive ways, particularly out­side the classroom walls. One reason for this is the fo­cus of traditional schooling on learning isolated facts in compartmentalized disciplines. Not surprisingly, this knowledge often cannot be transferred to real-world problems. Theories of constructivism and situated",

3800,,"cognition suggest that for learning to be useful the learner needs to be actively involved in constructing new knowledge within meaningful contexts, not merely absorbing it. Furthermore, learning is enhanced by group-oriented collaborative work, reflection and articulation. These are therefore the central premises of a multidisciplinary approach to structuring learning within the context of case-based instruction that we are developing at the EduTech Institute. This approach is called Multiple Case-Based Approach to Generative Environments for Learning (McBAGEL).",
3801,,"Three factors distinguish this approach: (1) The use of generative problems to promote learning. Gen­erative problems are those that motivate open-ended inquiry, whose solutions require synthesis, which have multiple solutions, and which, therefore, promote the generation, evaluation and combination of ideas in the course of problem solving. The type of generative problems that we use are design problems. (2) The use of multiple cases provided by computer-based case li­braries as knowledge sources to aid problem solving. (3) The emphasis on software-scaffolded and group­oriented collaborative work in and out of the class­room.",
3802,,"We are designing a computer-based learning envi­ronment that we expect students to use as a workspace for conducting work as part of this approach. The ar­chitecture of this environment and its components is the main topic of this paper. However, since the envi­ronment's role is to support collaborative learning in the context of generative problem solving, a discussion of the approach and the educational philosophy behind it precedes the description of the computer environ­ment. Then, software components of the environment that have already been designed, implemented and used in classrooms of Georgia Tech are described.

3809,,"2. Educational Framework 
Our approach is based on a synthesis of ideas on learning and problem solving from the fields of educa­tion, cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. This approach is based on the following five central tenets: 
	( 1) Learning is enhanced by problem solving. Learning is more effective when it occurs through ac­tivities associated with solving generative problems (e.g., identifying and formulating the problem, generat­ing alternatives, evaluating, decision making, reflect­ing, and articulating) rather than through transmission models of instruction. Design, by its very nature, is a generative activity. Therefore, design-oriented prob­lems are particularly effective for technical domains like engineering and architecture and may well provide effective anchors for math and science learning.",
3810,,"(2) Collaborative work is central to learning. Stu­dents are expected to solve problems and do assign­ments in groups. Group-oriented work, in and out of the classroom, is important both in facilitating learning and in preparing students for today's multidisciplinary team-oriented workplaces. As students work in col­laborative groups, they are forced to articulate and re­flect upon their thinking, leading to an appreciation of the importance of distributed cognition [14] as well as enhancing learning and subsequent transfer [3]. Col­laborative work allows students to successfully tackle problems more complex than what any one group member could do alone.",
3811,,"( 3) Access to multiple cases will facilitate flexible learning. Providing students with access to multiple cases that contain information-rich and contextualized descriptions of specific situations set within the broader context of a course can significantly impact learning and transfer. The availability and use of mul­tiple cases during problem solving facilitates learning new knowledge, and supports the adaptation and transfer of previous solutions to the current problem [11]. It is expected that by revisiting design skills through numerous cases, flexible transfer of these skills will be supported [20]. Intelligent computer­based case libraries can provide students with not only such access but also means of flexibly navigating among cases and parts of cases.",
3812,,"(4) Learning and the acquisition of problem-solv­ing skills need to be scaffolded. The experiences im­plementing effective problem-based learning environ­ments teach us that solving real-world problems re­quires scaffolding, i.e., help from facilitators, knowl­edgeable experts, and the learning environment [12, 18]. The goals of scaffolding are to enable students to carry out a reasoning process or achieve a goal that they would not be able to do without help, and to facili­tate learning to achieve the goal without support. The scaffolding of different skills can be provided through software, by appropriately utilizing multimedia and tools such as collaboration software, simulation and vi-",

3815,,"(5) A shared electronic workspace that seamlessly integrates a full variety of functionalities for the above will enhance learning. This workspace will tie to­gether tools that students will use while solving prob­lems, collaborating, and perusing multiple cases. It is also an ideal vehicle for providing adaptive software­realized scaffolding of various skills. Finally, it will encourage both synchronous and asynchronous collab­orative work among students. Such an integrated yet flexible computer-based learning environment that the students use as a ""professional workspace"" is a central component of our approach.",
3816,,"We want to situate classroom learning in informa­tion-rich contexts that afford opportunities for problem formulation, exploration and discovery. Students will work on problems for extended periods of time, reflect­ing and articulating on both the process and the prod­uct. Case libraries will provide them with both relevant data and specific solution strategies in the domain of instruction, all within the context of complex and real­istic real-world problems. The problems students have to solve and the cases that are made available to them serve as anchors for learning. Collaborative, reflective and articulative activities, aided by the tools and cases provided by the computer-based learning environment, should improve the students' knowledge, problem solv­ing skills, and self-directed learning skills. Cases, be­ing rich knowledge structures that explicate both con­ceptual and strategic knowledge, will allow the stu­dents to master concepts, principles and strategies in the course of attempting to solve problems. The col­laborative nature of student activities should facilitate the construction of new knowledge since it encourages articulation and intra-group communication. Our ap­proach is designed in particular to address the follow­ing three issues.",
3817,,"Cognitive Flexibility and Transfer. Consideration of a single case leads to inflexibility of the acquired knowledge and strategies [22]. Rather than having stu­dents focus on a single case, our intention is to have students revisit ideas from multiple cases both through the design problems that students work on and the de­sign cases in the case libraries. We believe that by having students analyze multiple cases, and by having them reflect on how these cases are similar and differ­ent to the problems they are solving, more flexible knowledge should be constructed. The cognitive flex­ibility theory [20] supports this prediction.",
3818,,"Collaboration. Collaboration is a key piece of our approach. Research on collaborative learning shows that learning while solving problems in groups facili­tates the learning of articulation skills, makes learning more effective for all group members, and allows stu­dents to successfully tackle problems more complex than any one group member could individually solve [3, 14, 17].

The second activity planned by the teacher, which we will refer to as the ""geotime project"", differed from the climate project in three important ways. First, this activity was conducted by project teams rather than individual students. The teacher made the decision for this to be a group project largely because he found it time-consuming to regularly read and comment on an electronic notebook for every student during the climate project. Second, students had less flexibility with respect to their project topics than they had been given in the first project cycle. Rather than being free to explore any question they found interesting within a broad topic area, each student group was required to master materials about a specific period of geologic time, mostly using traditional resources found in the library.",

The aim of the paper was to examine how elementary school students (grade 5-6) make use of two different types of networked database systems specially designed for intentional learning. Students were allowed to rep­resent their thoughts and knowledge in the form of texts or graphics in the database, then collaboratively manipulate them for improving their comprehension of study topics in the classroom. As a framework for de­scribing differences in the students' activities between those who highly benefited and those who did not, ""In­formation-Access Characteristics (Perkins, 1993)"" was considered. Results showed: (1) that students who highly benefited from their activities in the database significantly more engaged in knowledge-transforming activities which are considered critical to high concep­tual progress, and (2) that a system affordance which al­lowed students to conduct their joint writing activities significantly prompted such a transforming activities at a joint-space of their collaborative learning.",
3935,,"1. Problem 
Recent cognitive research on students' learning in the",
3936,,"classroom has suggested the importance of develop­ment of learning environments where students authen­tically engage in knowledge construction (e.g., Bruer, 1993). Bereiter and Scardamalia (e.g., 1989) argued that students should be supported to engage in their in­tentional learning. Students bring their own inquiries into their learning activity, then collaboratively pursue",
3937,,"the inquiries through building their collective knowl­edge. What students learn is not consequences from their learning activity based on problems given by teachers, i.e., learning from problem-solving (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1989), but the learning process itself",
3938,,by which students engage in knowledge-building as ef­fective collaborators in the classroom community.,
3939,,Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Envi­ronments (CSILE) is a networked database system,
3940,,,
3941,,which encourages students' intentional learning through,
3942,,"progressive discourse (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1993). Students are allowed to externalize their thoughts in the",
3943,,"database in the form of texts or graphics, then manipu­late their represented knowledge in building further knowledge. The database is accessible to anyone who is registered as a member. 	Students can asyn­chronously collaborate through mutual commentaries.",
3944,,"They can create comment notes to add their reflective thoughts on their friends' thoughts. Thus, students with CSILE work as members of the classroom com­munity in pursuing their inquiries on study topics (Scardamalia, Bereiter, Brett, Burtis, Calhoun & Smith-Lea, 1992).",
3945,,"Because CSILE is a new technology not available in regular classroom learning, students' learning activ­ity becomes much more rich and complex than ever.",
3946,,"In CSILE, students are engaged in overt knowledge­building by manipulating their knowledge in the form",
3947,,"of texts or graphics, rather than manipulating their in­ternal knowledge structures. Furthermore, students share their represented knowledge with others so that anyone can build his/her knowledge through coordina­tion of self and others' knowledge. Thus, students' knowledge-building on the network occurs through dy­namic interaction among learners and their constructed knowledge database. How do students engage in this dynamic activity? How does the networked database mediate students' learning? These problems are pursued",
3948,,"by analyzing students' computer-mediated activities from the perspective of distributed cognition (Salomon, 1993).",

3950,,"dent information processors (Salomon, 1993). Knowl­information processing system rather than as indepen­",
3951,,edge and mental resources for the global system are widely distributed across people and available tools. Our performance in a complex cognitive task is a pro­cess by which the distributed cognitive resources dy-,

Although individual learners cannot know and manipulate all the cognitive resources, they can collaborate with one another in constructing high quality knowledge which does not belong to any specific individuals but to a community of the learners (Bereiter, 1994). In this sense, CSILE is a networked environment where community knowl­edge is constructed. A goal of students' learning is to contribute to the knowledge-building in their classroom community as well as to advance levels of their under­standing (Oshima, 1994). The process of knowledge­building which should be examined in CSILE class­rooms is not only a process by which each student in­ternalizes external information, but a process by which s/he engages in knowledge-building in the classroom community.",
3958,,"How can we describe human beings as part of a global distributed cognitive system? Because tradi­tional cognitive science has focused on representation of human's internal structure, its approach is not ap­propriate for us to examine students' activity in CSILE. From the perspective of distributed cognition, Perkins (1993) proposed a new level of analysis of human mind, cognition as information flow. He de­fined person-plus-surround as a unit of analysis of cog­nition, and focused on information flow in the person­plus-surround system. Here, the focus of the analysis is no longer on how subjects' internal structures are constructed, but rather on how subjects work in the global system. To describe the information flow in a target global system, Perkins suggested the following information-access characteristics of the system: 
	Knowledge. When the global cognitive system functions in a task, various types of knowledge are used, from content-specific knowledge to higher-order knowledge such as monitoring and planning. In the present study, we focus on different types of descriptive knowledge in the database (discussed later).",
3959,,"Representation. How knowledge is represented is another important aspect. Because CSILE is mainly driven by written discourse, we focus on written form of knowledge.",
3960,,Retrieval. Although necessary knowledge is rep­,
3961,,"resented in the system, it does not mean that we can always access it in a contextually appropriate way. Studies have shown: (1) that experts usually learn nec­essary knowledge and skills in a quite problem-based situation so that they can easily access the necessary knowledge in their work (e.g., Brown, Collins & Duguid, 1989); and (2) that authentic problem-based learning in a meaningful context can prompt learners' acquisition of knowledge which can be later retrieved in an appropriate way (e.g., Lampert, 1986). Here, we focus on (1) how learners use their own and others' knowledge represented in the database, and (2) how they manipulate the knowledge in advancing their compre­hension.",
3962,,,
3963,,"Construction. ""Construction"" means physical or psychological spaces that support subjects to engage in knowledge manipulation and construction. The places are not necessarily placed in subjects' heads. In a per­son-plus-surround, we can use any available spaces such as a paper, a blackboard, and an electronic docu­ment. Recent studies on effects with intellectual tech­nologies (Salomon, Perkins & Globerson, 1991) showed that computer support which allows learners to run and see their represented knowledge improves the learners' reflective processes in problem solving and helps them acquire higher levels of understanding ( e.g., Nathan, Kintsch & Young, 1992). Here, we focus on two different spaces of collaborative learning in CSILE.",
3964,,"In the present study, we had two specific research questions. The first is what differences are there in in­formation-access characteristics between students who benefit greatly from their activity and those who do not in CSILE. Through pursuing this question, we can ac­quire information for improving students' activities in such a way that they effectively engage in higher qual­ity of learning. In addition to this, we examined differ­ences in system affordances between the two different system configurations. Because of the system devel­opment, students have used different systems in differ­ent years. One critical shift in the system was from individual-note based to discussion-note based (Scardamalia, Bereiter, Hewitt & Webb, in press). In discussion notes, students are directed to engage in joint writing activities on a shared problem. Theoreti­cally, it is expected that students can benefit from their engagement in such joint activities. However, it has not yet been discussed how such a shift in the system affects students' activity in CSILE. Therefore, we compared students' activities between the two system configurations.",

The present study examined two fifth- and sixth-grade combined classrooms taught by the same teacher which used different types of systems in two consecutive years. In the first year, twenty-nine students used a version of CSILE (the ""first-year system"") in which they reported their thoughts on a study topic, electric­ity, in their individual text or graphic notes. Hence, the database was a compilation of such individual notes. Students organized and advanced self and others' thoughts by accessing and commenting on the notes. In the second year, twenty-seven students used another version (the ""second-year system"") in which they re­ported their thoughts on a study topic, force, through dialogical written discourse on their collaborative prob­lems in discussion notes. In discussion notes, students proposed problems to pursue and reported their",

The first is referent-centred knowledge (Bereiter, · 1992). This is definitional and descriptive information which clearly refers to a concept. It is easy for students to pick out this type of knowledge from their resource materials or their minds. The second is problem-cen­tred knowledge (Bereiter, 1992). This is process-ori­ented information such as causal mechanisms which have potential to facilitate students' understanding. The third is metacognitive or reflective knowledge. Al­though it has been considered to rarely appear in an ex­ternal form (Perkins, 1993), students, here, were asked to write down their reflection on their own learning.

For instance, in the initial stage of their learning, most of students did not have explanatory dis­course in the sense that they did not have any clear un­derstanding of what to explain. They wrote down their ideas such as ""Electricity works because a light bulb is turned on,"" and ""Electricity makes a light bulb light up.""

Multiculturalism is the state in which one has mastered the knowledge and developed the skills necessary to feel",

4116,,"comfortable and communicate effectively with people of any culture, and in any situation involving a group of people of diverse cultural backgrounds (Pusch, 1979).

Lee's (1983) three guidelines for designing effective multicultural training also blend with the features of",
4122,,"hypermedia. First, the learning must be organized and structured. Although the order in which the informa­tion is accessed is within the control of the student, hypermedia is highly structured so users can access the",
4123,,"correct information at the appropriate time. Second, multicultural information should be presented in new ways. Interactive media itself is unique learning tool to many students, but beyond that, each interaction with hypermedia can be new and different for the user. Finally, Lee emphasizes the need for interaction. Hy­permedia requires the user to interact with the computer and the information. The learner can't sit passively and",
4124,,watch information cross the screen. The user must take action with the computer in order to gain informa­tion. Ridley (1994) also stresses the importance of in­,
4125,,teraction to forward the process multicultural education.,

4134,,when paired with someone sharing similar beliefs.,
4135,,One woman reported:,
4136,,".. . / had a partner who didn't think the same as I did, and I didn't know the boundaries. That's part of the problem with multicul­turalism. You don't want to admit how racist you really are ... or have someone dis­cover the things that you hide. I wouldn't want to come to some self-realization with someone I didn't know right there.",

4138,,I found myself discussing things with the girl on my right because I knew her. I think that helped [ me process the informa­tion] .,
4139,,"Although only one student reported in the inter­view that she had discussed information with others, it was observed that most of the students working alone interacted with others sitting nearby at several points during their time on the computer. 	Sometimes these interactions were to find help with the mouse or how to navigate the program. More often, the FD students shared information with each other about the program.",

4143,,nent to this learning experience on multiculturalism. The students in the FD reported that making the infor­mation real through discussion was important. Stu­dents felt that the facilitator provided alternative av­enues to work with and interpret the information they gathered first individually.,

4149,,"This last quote shows one of the main differences between the FD and PD discussion. The discussions with the PD group was more frequent and spontaneous. Discussions were continuous and took on an air of en­couragement. One partner would encourage the other to type in a response to a question, or to manipulate the mouse for a time.

4158,,"3.3. Interaction with the computer 
One of the most exciting aspects of the study was to observe the students interact with a computer. Several of the students were visibly dismayed to discover that their exploration of multiculturalism involved the use of a computer.",

4163,,Some students expressed satisfaction with the vari-ety that the program could provide:,
4164,,"I liked the voices on the screen. That really added to the program a lot. I liked the 
quotes, like Martin Luther King and others.",
4165,,"There was some stuff that was really getting you to think about situations and there was some stuff that was just educational, ... 
there was enough balance that kept me in­terested to go on and see what the next box was like.",
4166,,"The PD students were able to use their partner to find more information. Partners were observed encour­aging one another to go further and explore more. Many times, a partner would notice a button that the other person hadn't, and the pair would decide to inves­tigate. On several occasions, one partner would start to lose interest and be ready to quit, but the enthusiasm of the other person would reinspire him/her to continue. Additionally, students who weren't comfortable with the computers were able to rely on their partners to help them along the way. When the program allowed",

The other stu­dents in the FD treatment either did not find the com­ment boxes, or could not figure out how to type into the boxes.",
4170,,"4. Discussion 
Multicultural educators are in agreement that interac­tion is an important component of diversity training. The results of this study seem to support this notion. Students in each group both reported and were observed interacting with other individuals while using ""Managing Diversity."" Even though the FD students knew that they would be having an opportunity to talk about multiculturalism in their group, they still sought out other people for discussion. The conversations in the PD group focused more on sharing information and",

Criterion-referenced grading, which uses grades to measure students' level of mastery of the subject mate­rial against a stated standard rather than to rank them within the class, has profoundly altered the attitudes of both students and teacher so that learning has become what Koschmann [11] calls an 'active process.'",

We also have plans for developing a single-stage groupware editor that will support multiple people simultaneously writing a scenario. The editor will provide object-level coordination of the objects (e.g., the characters or roles, their scripts, and the functional requirements) that make up explicit scenarios.",

Both of these challenges are addressed by Project CIRCLE (Community of Information Resources and Collabora­tive Learning Environments), a collaborative univer­sity/public school project funded by the U.S. Depart­ment of Education Secretary's Fund for Innovation in Education.

In this paper we propose that aesthetics provides a useful, efficient approach for thinking about and creat­ing representative scenarios within constructivist case studies. We suggest that complexity, richness and ex­periential fidelity of the case are functions of aesthetic issues. Our observations draw from the work of Eisner, Dewey, research in graphic design and architecture, our own academic training as artists, and a series of formative studies in which these ideas have been ex­plored within actual instructional situations. Among the issues we have explored are use of the artist's voice, honesty in materials, the understanding of the distinction between medium and tool, and the creation of a unified experience.",

4358,,"1. Introduction 
By their nature, case studies represent an experience through which the learner can study, experiment and discuss a phenomenon without the liabilities of becom­ing engaged in a problem within an actual environ­ment. Case studies provide students with the opportu­nity to share and investigate an experience and arrive at rich, meaningful conclusions. However, current ap­proaches to the design of computer-based case studies are frequently inadequate and inconsistent. From a tra­ditional instructional design perspective, the process of preparing a case study is typically defined in terms of specifying objectives, collecting and editing material, and presenting it clearly and unambiguously. We and others have criticized cases built using this approach as not being sufficiently experiential [4, 15, 1, 12]. Case studies created in this fashion focus on allowing the student to extract a message and then apply it to a new situation; the complexity of the case is reduced in order to achieve this goal. The student may assume that all",
4359,,,
4360,,"the pieces of the puzzle are present in the case; she has only to fit them together. The great effort that writing a good instructional case study requires is often not re­paid in terms of rich, transferable experience.",
4361,,"Constructivists point to case studies as a means of providing an authentic context in which learning tasks may be embedded. However, there is a dearth of litera­ture on how to create these authentic contexts. The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt state that the facts of a case ought to be embedded within a video narrative [5]. Yet, there is considerable difficulty in applying this guideline within an ill-structured sub­ject domain where the ""facts"" of a case are unclear. Other researchers suggest that the density and band­width of multimedia may be used to represent the messiness and ambiguity of an authentic experience [e.g., 4, 17]. Yet, we question the efficiency of this ap­proach. Designing the case may mean creating vast databases of information; much of the student's time is spent dealing with an inundation of data. Having to deal with masses of uninterpreted data can actually be constricting; one designer was compelled to add video essays to counteract this effect and to provide a ""feel"" for the location as seen by the filmmaker [13].",
4362,,"We believe that the ""richness"" and ""lifelikeness"" , and experiential fidelity of a case have less to do with the amount of information provided and more to do with an aesthetic sensibility [16]. The messiness and complexity of an authentic context may neither suffi­ciently nor efficiently be represented by great quanti­ties of data in a variety of media, but by the way the creators chose to arrange them. We suggest that aes­thetics provides a useful, efficient approach for think­ing about and creating representative scenarios within constructivist case studies. Our observations draw from the work of Eisner, Dewey, research in graphic design and architecture, our own academic training as artists, and a series of formative studies in which these ideas have been explored within actual instructional situa­tions.",

Much of the richness of a collaborative learning envi­ronment comes from the differing constructions that different learners bring to the learning domain.

4584,,"1. Introduction 
Personal construct psychology (PCP) [1] emphasizes the idiographic nature of individual constructions of the world and hence raises questions about the basis of inter-personal collaboration and shared, social con­structions [2]. PCP has been used extensively in both studying and supporting learning processes [3-6], and computer-based tools have been developed to elicit, model and compare construction systems [7-9]. Such tools running on personal computers have been used to support collaborative learning [6], and the tools have been extended to support collaborative elicitation and analysis over local area networks [10, 11].",
4585,,"Tools for eliciting and comparing construction systems could become a truly emancipatory technology [12] for collaborative learning, if they were widely available over the Internet. This article describes the operation of such tools as part of the World-Wide Web, and illustrates their application to collaborative learning.",
4586,,"2. Construct Elicitation and Modeling 
The major methodology that we have used for the elici­tation of constructs and terminology from individuals and groups is based on extensions of the repertory grid",

4588,,"technique originally proposed by Kelly [1] as an empir­ical measurement methodology appropriate to personal construct psychology. Repertory grid techniques elicit knowledge indirectly by prompting individuals for critical elements and relevant constructs in a coherent sub-domain. The techniques are difficult to undertake manually as they require feedback and management from the elicitor while at the same time attempting to avoid inter-personal interactions that would distort the elicitee's construct structures. Hence the advent of the personal computer in the mid-1970s and its evolution into the graphic workstations of the 1980s has made the computer implementation of interactive repertory grid elicitation an attractive area of development [7, 13, 14].",
4589,,"The repertory grid methodology gives a basis for approximating intensional distinctions, or constructs, through their extensions when applied to elements in a domain. The distinctions made by two individuals can then be compared in terms of the differences in their extensions and in the terminology used. The two rela­tions of similarity between distinctions and between terminology give rise to a 4-way classification of con­structs [8, 15] as shown in Figure 1.",

Bolling (1994) has discussed main­taining group journals as a means by which students may effectively ""collaborate."" Individual journals are difficult to share among one's classroom peers. Group journals are at least shared among a small group. My approach has been one of extending the notion of a group journal, to a series of journal entries which are constantly available to all class members (Narrative CMC Journals).

This is a ""USENET-like"" envi­ronment where I established a newsgroup for each of my classes. Students are required to make weekly postings, called ""reflections,"" after each class meeting. Within one week after they have posted a ""reflection"" they are required to ""react"" to other classmates' reflec­tions. Throughout a 15 week semester, each student posts 12 reflections and 12 reactions. Reflections are made to several aspects of each weekly meeting includ­ing simulations, video tapes, whole class discussions, lectures, and the DEC's. They have assigned readings from textbook chapters as well as primary author arti­cles. The DEC activity usually involves two other stu­dents, each of which is writing an answer to some one ease's prepared questions, or reacting to someone else's answer to their own question. The three DEC mem­bers are randomly determined each week. This deter­mines the people whom they must ""react"" to in the fol­lowing weeks netposting. 	Throughout a typical semester, then, each student reacts to many different people in the class. And, their reflections and reactions are available to all other class members.",

Per­ceptions with regard to 1) higher-order thinking [THK], 2) depth of knowledge [KNW], 3) Connected­ness to the world beyond the classroom [CON], 4) conversation [COV]. and 5) social support for student achievement [SSA] are the primary focus of this sur­vey. It was anonymously filled out on the last day of the class. Descriptive and comparative statistics are used to describe these results presently based upon 41 graduate students from two classes: 21 respondents from a Fall, 1994 advanced Educational Psychology class, and 20 students from a Spring, 1995 class deal­ing with group dynamics in the classroom.",

This paper suggests a possible application of the World Wide Web for distance teacher training in the area of mathematics education. 	INSTRUCT (Implementing the NCTM School Teaching Recommendations Using Collaborative Telecommunications) is designed to introduce secondary mathematics instructors to the Professional standards for teaching 	mathematics (NCTM, 1991) while fostering a sense of community among teachers who are physically removed from each other. Emphasis is placed on blending synchronous and asynchronous technologies to facilitate sustained interaction and real-time application of concepts. Options contained within INSTRUCT include a hypermedia version of the Professional Standards for Classroom Teaching, links for connecting to on-line educational resources, the ability to attend synchronous meetings with other INSTRUCT users, opportunities to join in asynchronous discussions, and general access to the Internet. Three key research questions concerning this type of technology are discussed: The amount of face-to-face training required for teachers to become comfortable using INSTRUCT, the extent to which collaboration features of INSTRUCT must be formalized to ensure involvement by participants, and whether use of INSTRUCT can foster among teachers a sense of self-worth and community resulting in lasting change in practice.",

Among these applications, the WWW sites dedicated to instruction are generating new interest in the uses of computers in distance education. In many cases these sites merely represent classroom materials, such as syllabi or class notes, which are available as an outside resource to students enrolled in a course. However, there are at least a few WWW sites offering individuals the opportunity to complete a course remotely, without the need for attendance in class. As these sorts of applications are contemplated, we believe it is essential to include a consideration of the collaborative learning tools that will provide necessary interaction and foster a sense of community for those individuals isolated by geography or other constraints.",
4729,,"2. Background 
The focus of this paper is on the use of WWW for distance teacher training, specifically in the area of mathematics education. Teachers in North Carolina, as in many other states, are. required to participate in inservice staff development as a part of a licensure renewal cycle which repeats every five years. 	This training normally takes the form of workshops conducted at a single site over the course of several days or even several weeks, typically during the summer months. 	Drawbacks to this type of staff development include the time and money required for travel to the training site; the artificiality of training done in isolation of the classroom, wherein teachers must wait until the school year begins again to apply their learning; the logistical problems of attempting to support teacher change once teachers have returned to their schools; and the difficulty inherent in trying to keep teacher training current in a discipline such as mathematics education where knowledge and practice are rapidly evolving.",

The results of this qualitative study con­firmed that the preservice teachers who field-tested LEAP did engage in rich dialogue triggered by the video-cases, the books, and their recollections of class­room experiences.",
4906,,"Had they adopted a new perspective, however? The majority of the students stated that they were not famil­iar with the approach before LEAP, and the education courses at this field site did not include instruction on the workshop approach. The authors of the sample es­says were overwhelmingly in favor of the workshop approach after LEAP, and half stated their intent to use the approach in their classrooms. A comparison of the goals the preservice teachers expressed before their ex­perience with LEAP and after it supports the conclu­sion that many of them had adopted a new approach, at least momentarily.",

4926,,"1. Introduction 
In 1986, Ohio University initiated a radically re­designed MBA program. The redesign was prompted by the extensive criticism of MBA programs that was",
4927,,"popular at that time and our own assessment of the quality of the educational experience we were providing students. The redesign was based on published criti­cisms of MBA programs, our discussions with leaders of potential employing organizations, and our own study of the future nature of business and the implied required characteristics of workers.",
4928,,"The initial innovation in the MBA curriculum was the institution of a year-long holistic ""course"" called integrated business analysis (IBA) and a companion year-long behavioral skill development program. The IBA used a problem-based learning pedagogy to simul­taneously developed target knowledge, skills, and per­sonal characteristics.",
4929,,"After seven years experience with the redesigned program, multiple assessments of its impact, and con­",
4930,,"tinued study of the evolving needs of the business community, we determined that it was time for another radical redesign. The present program was developed during the 1993-94 academic year and implemented",
4931,,,
4932,,"2. The Ohio University MBA 
The program, as it is now structured, is an intense 13-month learning experience, starting in August of the first year and concluding in September of the second year. The program uses an action-learning format with a theoretical base in cognitive constructivism. This design places learners into the type of projects and work situations that they will face as a leaders of in­formation-age organizations in the 21st century. Stu­dents learn basic business concepts, but learn them in the context of their use, maximizing the ability to both recall and apply those concepts as they move back into the work world. Students develop the skills (communication, collaboration, teamwork) and the per­sonal characteristics (initiative, creativity, personal re­sponsibility) that have become requisite for success. Students develop a high level of comfort with informa­tion technology as they regularly access information through the resources of the internet, collaborate elec­tronically over time and space, and develop and make professional-level computer-driven presentations.",
4933,,The program centers around some 8-12 major pro­jects. These projects tend to be large macro problems that address business holistically. Each project con­tains multiple smaller problems that students must ad­dress to managing the total learning experience. Stu­dents construct their knowledge of business practices by working their way through the problems. Student learning is aided by the ability to access appropriate content on a just-in-time basis. Students learn content at a time when it will be useful to them in their man­agement of the learning problems. While some of the,

4943,,"3. The Action-Learning Process 
In the action-learning process, students are presented with an ill-structured problem/situation without the benefit of prior preparation. They are challenged to frame the problem and decide upon action to be taken. Problems/situations may be presented in a number of",

Students thus need to make their learning explicit and decontextualize their knowledge so that it can be used in a variety of set­tings.",
4948,,"Note that there are many variations possible. Stu­dents can work on problem/situations individually or in teams. Problem/situations can be rather simple (requiring only a short time to complete) or complex (requiring a whole quarter or semester). Students may end the process with a formal presentation of findings and recommendations to a panel of executives, or with a general group discussion which produces no single solution. These are only a few examples of numerous possibilities.",

4955,,5. The Use of Information Technology Information technology is central to the delivery of the Ohio University MBA. It impacts both the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning system.,
4956,,"Throughout the program, students receive assign­ments from and communicate with faculty electroni­cally. They search electronic data-bases for information. They prepare and submit reports electronically. The formal presentations they make to faculty and to busi­ness people evaluating their progress are electronic and computer-driven, frequently incorporating multi-media.",
4957,,"To prepare for and finalize their global alliances project ( our MBA students team with students from a local university and complete a consulting project for a local business during a two-week visit to another coun­try. In the past those countries have included Hungary, Malaysia, India, Thailand, and Mexico}, students col­laborate with their in-country partners electronically be­fore they arrive to work together, and after returning to the states they continue their collaboration to complete the project. We expect to move into the use of tele­conferencing as soon as it becomes economically feasi­ble.",
4958,,"While all of these uses of information technology are important, the greatest potential is in our recent in­corporation of information technology to enable group collaboration, and in the ability to search electronic data bases for information. During the program, most learning problems are approached in learning groups. Historically, this required that students meet face-to­face and share information related to learning issues and information related to the problem being addressed. Further, students needed to discuss their individual analysis and reach decisions regarding group positions.",
4959,,"Although students participated in team building and were trained in group decision making, most of their meetings were terribly inefficient. The meetings required that individuals come together at the same time in the same place (this was particularly difficult for part-time students). Further, the meetings normally involved start-up, wind-down and considerable social content.",

One activity of the teachers and students during the time we observed them was preparation for a local science fair. This gave us the opportunity to observe some students' presenta­tions of library research and later of project findings. Our informal impressions were consistent with others' ethnographic observation that discussion was teacher­initiated and teacher-centered, and that students' talk was social or task-related rather than conceptual [10].",

5071,,"4.1. Generating Multiple Hypotheses 
One of the potential strengths of collaborative work is that alternate hypotheses and multiple perspectives may be considered. Consistent with this claim, subjects in dyads or triads usually generated several hypotheses (in contrast to observed science-fair monological pre­sentations). For example, one dyad generated these hy­potheses for the Galapagos problem: (1) the dating of the species' divergence may be wrong; (2) the islands may have been dated using younger surface rocks formed during volcanism subsequent to the initial for­mation of the island; (3) ""the Galapagos islands may have moved near to another land mass where the igua­nas were found"" (subsequently this student asked about tectonic plate movement); and (4) when the Galapagos were forming, another island near them had the two species on it already. In an HN and AIDS session (not pictured), discussion was focusing on discrepancies be­tween the time during which HIV is most active, the onset of immunity, and the onset of AIDS symptoms. One student suggested that two disease processes may be involved; another suggested that HN may not be the cause of AIDS but enables contracting AIDS. Typ­",

Most of the students in the collaborative studies cre­ated nodes, filled them with text ( either typed in or copied) and linked them. Only one student completely misunderstood the representation, attempting to use Belvedere as a pictorial rather than a symbolic drawing program. The students in the classroom seemed to have clear opinions on the AIDS issue. Many students in both the lab and the classroom studies brought in knowledge and personal experiences from outside the textual materials provided to them. Most students were able to incorporate several points of the debate into their diagrams, drawing on the printed texts and/or the on-line information provided them, even in the short span of a class period. When prompted, most students were able to discuss what they thought about various aspects of the two positions, even if they were unable or unwilling to incorporate their thoughts into a Belvedere pane. Apart from collaborative processes to be discussed, difficulties arose primarily from prob­lems with the software, limited screen size, and lack of clarity concerning the task posed to them.",

When conflicting hypotheses were proposed, some groups engaged in a dialectic tension between chal­lenges and resistance to change that provides a poten­tial microcosm of scientific debate. For example, con­sider the dialogue of a Galapagos-problem dyad, se­lected portions of which are reproduced in Table 1. (The corresponding diagram is shown in Figure 2. The students chose pseudonyms.) Initially (3:38 of Table 1) Mo proposes that the two species came separately to the islands by floating or swimming. Emin then begins to encounter evidence that leads her to question this idea (3:57, 4:01 and 4:28), but Mo rather consistently dismisses it in order to maintain her reigning hypothe­sis. Later, we presented them with four alternate hy­potheses to consider. Subsequently ( 4:52), Emin gently challenges Mo's conception, apparently on the basis of parsimony. By the end of the session (5:07), Mo gives up her former hypothesis and chooses one of the new",

However, social processes do not always guarantee positive results.

Thus, in an effort to be politely consensual throughout, a cooperative pair or group may fail to make the most of individual knowledge and judgment.",

	As the number of jobs in which shared rather than in­	dividual work continues to grow, we are being forced to 	re-examine the waywe teach students to work. This pa­	per suggests that in today's workplace, computer sci­	ence students must be adept at both technical as well as 	cooperative skills. Towards this end, we developed a 	computer supported cooperative problem solving envi-. ronment designed to teach undergraduate computer sci­	ence majors how to elicit software requirements. We 	believe that requirements elicitation and cooperative 	skills are highly interrelated and, as such, can be taught 	more effectively through the use of a computer-sup­	ported cooperative environment. The environment en­	courages cooperative work, and yet provides instructors 	with the ability to monitor both individual and group 	performance. From our study, we found that students 	who used the computer-supported cooperative environ­	ment to elicit requirements performed better than those 	students who did the same task face-to-face.",
5174,,"1. 	Introduction 
The primary goal of this research is to teach student programmers how to work together via a computer­supported cooperative problem solving environment. It was designed to achieve this goal by enhancing stu­dents' cooperative skills within the specific domain of requirements elicitation. The specific task addressed by this research is one in which student programmers lo­cated in different geographical sites develop require­ments for a large software project. Thus, cooperative problem solving in this context refers to the shared, systematic behaviors displayed by two or more pro­grammers as they develop a requirements document. In order for the students to communicate in this environ­ment, a computer is used to assist the group in the per­formance of the task. As such, this particular com­puter-supported environment allows for synchronous communication between students who are separated by geographical distances (i.e., same time, different places).",
5175,,,
5176,,"The underlying model for this system states that effective cooperative problem solving is dependent on effective group competencies (Barge Hirokawa, 1989). An effective group competency is defined as a specific skill that helps a group complete a task (in this case, requirements elicitation) more effectively. Group com­petencies include, but are not necessarily limited to, es­tablishing operating procedures, analyzing problems, selecting criteria for good solutions, generating alterna­tive solutions, and evaluating solutions (Hirokawa Scheerhom, 1986). We selected this particular model, as opposed to other models of computer-supported co­operative work (Aiken Carlisle, 1992; Dewan Riedl, 1993; Dykstra Carsik, 1991; Malone, Crowston, 1994; Moran Anderson, 1990; unamaker, Dennis, Vogel George, 1991; Winograd, 1986), because it provides a link between group interaction and problem solving ef fectiveness. Such a model is necessary given that our goal is to improve cooperative problem solving. Thus, it is proposed that cooperative problem solving is not only a matter of willingness, attitude, or direction; it is a skill that can be taught, assisted, and enhanced. Fur­thermore, we believe that effective group problem solv­ing skills are instructable, if the particular skills in­volved can be articulated and practiced under circum­stances that require their use.",
5177,,"In order to test these theories, we built and evalu­ated a special interface to support Computer-Supported Cooperative Training (CSCT). The system serves as a training environment where students learn to engage in technical, cooperative tasks such as working together on large programming projects. In addition to support­ing network capabilities, the system has a series of shared windows or tools that represent and are linked to each of the above competencies for successful group problem solving.",
5178,,"After building the interface, we tested whether there were noticeable differences between ""successful"" and ""unsuccessful"" groups and related this to the use of the interface. Specifically, we asked: Can successful problem-solving groups be distinguished from less successful problem-solving groups on the basis of",

5185,,"tions, more frequent use of tools that tested current knowledge, and more systematic use of all shared tools for problem solving (Swigger, Brazile DePew, 1993).",
5186,,"Results of these case studies were then used to make the shared tools more active. That is, we gave the system the ability to explain how each shared tool can be used to enhance a particular group problem solving skill. Thus, the system contains knowledge about a group competency as embodied in the different shared tools and knowledge about how to improve that com­petencies. When groups fail to display appropriate group behaviors through the use of one or more of the shared tools, the system intervenes and suggests alter­native actions.",
5187,,The next section explains the rationale for select­ing the specific domain of requirements elicitation and provides a general overview of the cooperative problem solving interface. The following two sections describe the procedures used to build and enhance the training portion of our system. The last section concludes with a brief discussion and summary of the research.,
5188,,2. 	System Overview,
5189,,"2.1. 	Collaboration and Requirements Elici­tation 
The context for our computer-supported cooperative in­terface is programmers engaged in eliciting require­ments from users. The reason we selected this particu­lar learning task was; a) it is a particularly difficult skill to teach, and b) it requires students to work to­gether. Wexelblat (1987), for example, defines the software elicitation phase as ""one of refinement through conversation"" (p. 6) and argues that the prob­lem space must be explored and shared between the user and analyst. By engaging in the group dynamics be­tween programmer and user and programmer and pro­grammer, the software developer learns to translate am­biguous, missing, or conflicting specifications into something resembling a fully developed program (Boland, 1978; Sommervile, 1992). As research notes, it is difficult to teach software elicitation at the intro­",
5190,,"ductory level, largely because so much of the student's energies are focused on learning the mechanics of pro­gramming and not on mastering the communication",
5191,,"also the problem of trying to teach and monitor collab­skills necessary for group work (Leite, 1987). There is",
5192,,"oration within an introductory programming course and, at the same time, cover specific content. Thus, it would be helpful if someone could develop an envi­ronment that would allow students to master collabora­",
5193,,"tive skills and, more importantly, exercise those skills within the context of a computer science task such as",
5194,,,
5195,,"2.2. 	Description of System 
Having been convinced that requirements elicitation was an appropriate context for teaching collaboration,",
5196,,"we then built a special interface to support this task. The CSCT environment is a highly interactive pro­gram, allowing student programmers to pose questions",
5197,,"and conduct exchanges within the computer environ­ment, testing and enriching their knowledge of group skills by manipulating various shared windows. The physical components of the current system include 486-based workstations running Windows and con­nected to a Local Area Network (LAN). The CSCT environment is provided by three program modules, a graphical user interface, LAN communications support, and a database management system. Group problem solving is accomplished by displaying information concurrently to all members of the task group. Each workstation logs the message content, time, date, etc., in a database that can be accessed for analysis at a later time. All users can react to the actions of others (i.e., text or graphics) immediately through shared displays. The interface permits a logical dialogue to occur by providing participants with the ability to access any of the shared displays (i.e., tools) at any time during the conversation. All behaviors are stored in a database which is extremely helpful when analyzing the conver­sational quality of the messages at a later time.",
5198,,"As previously stated, effective cooperative problem solving skills were delineated using a model of group competency as developed by (Hirokawa Scheerhorn, 1986; Hirokawa, 1983). The specific examples of ""good"" cooperative skills that were selected are: analyz­ing problems, using correct operating procedures, stat­ing criteria, generating alternatives, and evaluating the solutions.",
5199,,"These behaviors were then encoded into the system via a series of shared tools or windows that represent each of the ommunication competencies. Thus, there is an shared tool that aids in problem orientation; another that helps in the establishment of criteria; a third that aids in the establishment of correct operating proce­dures; a fourth that helps solution generation and eval­uation. The global cooperative tools can be accessed by participants at any time during the interaction. In addi­tion there are several private tools that facilitate and enhance the shared tools. A more detail description of these tools now follows.",

Floor management styles include; a) choose a chairperson who manages the order of dis­cussion (chairperson), b) allow the person in control to select the next speaker (sequential), c) submit a request in a simple linear, sequential, queuing order according to first-come, first-serve (competitive).

Group mem­bers enter their ideas via this tool and are able to indi­cate the extent or seriousness of the problem. Partici­pants enter criteria for their requirements either directly into the Criteria Establishment Tool or by selecting one of the pre-defined criterion listed in the Criteria Dictionary subtool (Fig. 3). They must also assign a priority value to each criterion.,

Instead they go on and do an­other search, and in the cases we note here, never go back to examine the results. This can be due to the presence of multiple search goals, so that completing one leads to attempting the next before the results of the first are examined. Another observed cause was that undertaking one search inspired an idea for an­other tactic, and the users got carried away with trying out this technique before examining the results of their earlier trial. This behaviour has been noted both for individuals and for groups. We believe the situation may be more acute for groups, where a number of participants have competing suggestions for the next search tactic to try. The ability to subsequently view their actions using Ariadne proved useful to some groups in revealing this problem, and in inspiring group members to suggest subsequent search activities.

The influential work of Doise and Mugny [1], has given particular impetus to the study of group composition and theirwork predicts that group­generated conflict stimulates the jointconstruction of a more advanced concept which is then individuallyin­temalised. This study set out to investigate collabora­tive learning between pairs of students solving physics problemswith a computer. It tested the hypothesis that peer facilitation effectsare improved if participants have conflicting models of the task. Theresearch takes its direction from Piagetian theory which holds that conflict creates disequilibrium which canthen lead stu­dents to attempt the construction of new knowledge.

Student learning is not accidental: it is the direct result of what has been designed, intentionally or uninten­tionally, by teachers, schools, curriculum developers and communities. Behind teaching and learnng events are beliefs about learning which directly influence what students experience. This paper provides an historical perspective on current instructional design practices. While attendees at this conference may find it easy to discount the inadequacy of traditional theories of in­struction, an understanding of the historical evolution of these theories and their pervasive influence on K-12 education is necessary if we want to support teaching reform efforts. Without an understanding of the evolu­tion of current teaching practices, change efforts may be unsuccessful.",

The present study represented the final in a series of five which explored the performance of children in Logo tasks while they worked in one of three gender pairs (girl, boy or boy/ girl). Differences in perfor­mance based on the gender of the pair had been appar­ent in the early studies when specific types of tasks were presented as initial experiences in the new do­main. The present study analysed the strategies and interactions of 30 pairs of children (mean age 7 years 3 months) in relation to three sets of tasks. The children worked with the screen version of Logo (LCSI) in tasks that required them to make accurate copies of given (Logo) figures and to direct the turtle up a path to a destination The results revealed that when the copy task was presented first and followed by the track task there were no significant differences in perfor­mance in terms of accuracy or efficiency of moves made in order to reach the end of the path. This was a contrast to previous findings when the track task had been presented first. The current research illustrated that performance was moderated by the type of strate­gies that were deployed and the nature of the collabora­tion of the pairs.",

Recently there has been an increase in pressure on early childhood educators from parents and administra­tors to incorporate computers and other forms of tech­nology into early learning environments. Yet the in­formation that is available to early childhood educators pertaining to the perceived benefits to learning, of the new information technologies, and indeed, descriptions of how they can be used in early childhood settings, is scarce. Thus, it is not surprising to find that most are still sceptical that the financial outlay is not matched",

The computer is often viewed as being developmentally inappropriate for young children because their applications focus on the two dimensional and abstract concepts, programs that encourage individual participation and thus no op­portunity for social interactions and engagements that can foster language and cognition. The present re­search sought to provide information to early child­hood educators pertaining to learning with technology and to highlight some of the ways in which teachers and learners can facilitate cognitive and social aspects of learning, within a specific computer environment; Logo.",
5545,,"In most of the studies of young children ex­ploring with Logo, their performance, whether working individually, in pairs or small groups, has been de­scribed and related to either specific methodological issues pertaining to curriculum and teaching ( e.g Hawkins, Homolsky & Heide, 1984; Noss, 1984;) or to cognitive theories of learning (e.g. Clements & Nas­tasi, 1985, 1988; Webb, 1982, 1984). Only a limited number of these studies have considered performance with reference to the gender composition of pairs, small group or indeed individuals.

Technology, particularly telecomputing technology, has been praised for its potential to facilitate collabora­tive learning activities [ 4, 6]. In a project utilizirtg computer networks to provide ""teacher education stu­dents with hands-on opportunities to experience collab­orative, constructive learning,"" [2, p. 149], the Teach­ing Teleapprenticeships (TTa) team found computer networks have several advantages: (1) time flexibility; (2) distance flexibility; and (3) immediate feedback.

The project lasted one semester. Initially, the partici­pants were asked to write five essays analyzing a class­room case from different perspectives. For the first analysis, the participants were asked to analyze the case and provide a hypothetical action plan to cope with the problem situation based on their experiences and be­liefs. This was intended as a vehicle for them to reveal their present beliefs.
