         Abstract: Within the CSCL community and in computing and computational making more
         broadly, issues of equity continue to be under-researched and undertheorized. Here, we examine
         how FUSE Studios ­ a set of in-school, choice-based, STEAM learning environments, based
         around   a    set of digital and tangible making   challenges  ­  supports equitable access to and
         participation in making and computing. Drawing on web-log data and video-ethnographic data,
         we argue that four characteristics of FUSE support equity: the design of the challenges; the
         diverse ways of knowing and doing supported by the activity system; the specific interactions
         encouraged by the activity system; and the program's placement inside school. We focus, here,
         on gender equity, but also discuss implications and planned research on other aspects of equity.

Introduction
Within the CSCL community, issues of equity continue to be under-researched and undertheorized. Of the articles
published in the International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning since it started in 2006,
only one title references anything related to women or gender. Further, despite the theme of the 2017 conference,
"Making a Difference: Prioritizing Equity and Access in CSCL", of the over 200 contributions to the conference
proceedings, only six listed "equity and gender" as a keyword. Only 61 mentioned either "gender" or "equity" at
all in the text, and far fewer dealt with either issue substantively, with many mentions of "gender" appearing only
in a description of participants or groupings and many mentions of "equity" appearing only as authors quoted the
conference theme. This lack of attention to equity is reflective of larger inequities in participation in computing
and computational making (e.g., Funk & Parker, 2018; Lewis, 2015; Margolis & Fisher, 2002; Vossoughi &
Bevan, 2014). Despite well-documented equity problems in these fields, efforts to engage women and minorities
are still far too few and have been only minimally successful at involving a diverse audience in equitable ways.

Background
Research that has addressed equity in computing and computational making has done so in two ways. The first is
by attempting to create equitable access to these activities and spaces by removing barriers to entry for women,
minorities, and less affluent individuals (e.g., AAUW, 2000; Lewis, 2015). For example, Lewis (2015) found that
many women avoid makerspaces, because they don't have prior computing experience or struggle with the absence
of clear goals in making activities. However, multiple studies suggest that if we can get females in the door and
get them engaged, they are more likely to express increased confidence and empowerment related to the tools and
skills involved (e.g., Barniskis, 2014; Bowler, 2014; Fields & King, 2014). As a result, some recent efforts have
focused on bringing making and computing into schools, where there is greater access (e.g., Atit et al., in press).
         However, efforts to diversify access to making or computing have not necessarily resulted in equitable
participation (e.g., Scott, et al., 2015; Vossoughi & Bevan, 2014; Vossoughi et al., 2013). Thus, other studies
(e.g., Vossoughi et al., 2013) have focused on understanding what types of knowledge and interactions are valued
in a learning space and used this as a lens to see how the space does or doesn't create opportunities for young
people of different backgrounds to experience themselves as knowledgeable contributors. For example, Lachney,
et al. (2016)   argued     that the  technologies that designers  claim  are  value-free may  actually  be implicitly
exclusionary. Vossoughi and Bevan (2014) also argued that makerspaces have the potential to challenge deficit
views and support more inclusive learning if they support interactions such as novices and experts working side-
by-side, assisting each other, and continually shifting roles. However, if not, making and computing activities also
have the potential to reproduce existing inequities. For example, Volman and van Eck (2001) documented a
number of studies of learning through computer games where boys took over the computer, sidelining girls.
         A    handful  of  approaches   have recently  emerged   that seek to engage  females  and underrepresented
minorities in making and computing. One successful example of this is e-textiles (e.g., Barniskis, 2014; Buchholz,
et. al, 2014; Buechley, et al., 2008; Fields & King, 2014; Kafai, Fields & Searle, 2014). This approach integrates
craft  skills (textile work)    with electronic circuitry and computer  programming.   Researchers   have  found that
females prefer to learn new technology skills by incorporating them into such craft work (Barniskis, 2014; Kafai,
et al., 2014). Others have found that e-textiles disrupt preconceptions about gendered ability, access, and authority
in making (Buchholz, et. al, 2014). Still others have used e-textiles to create cultural connections between Native
American indigenous practices and computational thinking (Kafai, Searle, Martinez & Brayboy, 2014). However,

the specificity of this approach invites the questions, `What about students who aren't interested in textiles?' and
`What about skills that can't be taught through this (or any) single activity?' This tool-centered approach also
diverts focus away from the role that activity systems in which tools are embedded play in promoting equity.
           Another intervention that focused more holistically on providing supportive infrastructure for equitable
computational learning was "Digital Youth Divas" (DYD; Pinkard, et al., 2017). This out-of-school program used
narrative stories to motivate the creation of digital artifacts and support non-dominant, middle-school girls' STEM
interests and identities. In addition to the narrative-driven, project-based curriculum, DYD involved an online
social network, supportive adult mentors, and support for the extension of interests beyond the DYD context.
           Here, we explore a program, FUSE Studios (e.g., Stevens et al., 2016), which shares DYD's attention to
the role of sociomaterial infrastructure in supporting equitable interest development and learning but takes a
different  approach   to achieving  these goals. FUSE     is a set of in-school,    choice-based, STEAM      learning
experiences, structured around a set of digital and tangible making challenges. Drawing on web-log data, video-
ethnographic data, and interviews with students and teachers, we will show how FUSE supports equitable access
to and participation in making. We will also show how it supports learning that is embodied, enactive, extended,
and embedded, the conceptual themes of this year's conference. Elsewhere, we have written about the affordances
of this activity system for supporting: (1) a variety of collaborative learning arrangements (Penney, 2016; Stevens
et al., 2016); (2) the development and sharing of expertise (Penney, 2016; Stevens et al., 2016); (3) interest
development (Ramey, 2017; Ramey & Stevens, submitted); and (4) learning (Ramey, 2017; Ramey, Stevens, &
Uttal, submitted). Here, we examine whether and how these outcomes were equitably available. We focus the
discussion of equity here on gender equity, because this is where we have the most complete data. However, in
the Conclusion section, we also discuss implications for and future research about other dimensions of equity.

Methods
Research context
FUSE    is structured around  a set of almost 30  STEAM       challenge  sequences,   housed on   the FUSE   website
(fusestudio.net). These challenges level up like video games, with each challenge containing multiple levels of
increasing difficulty and complexity. The challenges are designed to build on student interests (e.g., video games,
jewelry or clothing design, music), as well as make connections to the tools and activities of STEAM professionals
(e.g., CAD,   3D  printing, programming,    electronics). FUSE   is structured   to allow students    choice in what
challenges  to do, how   to approach challenges,  and what     resources (e.g., other students, physical and  digital
materials) to draw upon for help. In other words, FUSE is more choice-based, student-driven, and interdisciplinary
than traditional learning in schools--or even learning in workshop-style making activities, where all students do
the same project or use the same tools (e.g., Fields & King, 2014). However, it also provides more structure and
support than many makerspaces, where learners are let loose to explore available tools without being provided
clear goals (e.g., Brahms, 2014). Further, although FUSE started as an after-school program, it is now primarily
being implemented in schools, as a standalone class. We argue that the following four characteristics of FUSE ­
(1) the design of the challenges; (2) the diverse ways of working and learning supported by the activity system;
(3) the specific interactions encouraged by the activity system; and (4) the program's placement inside the school
day--promote both equitable access to and equitable participation in this learning environment for girls and boys.

Data collection and analysis
The first way in which we examined gender equity in FUSE was to examine challenge activity data from the
FUSE website. Every student who creates an account on the website is asked to indicate their gender. Once users
set up accounts, they are met with a gallery of challenges to choose from. They are also able to watch trailer videos
to invite interest in particular challenges. Once they identify a challenge of interest, they can choose to "start"
level one of the challenge (an action that the website logs). In order to unlock subsequent levels (up to five), users
must "complete" the previous level by uploading an image, video, or digital artifact that demonstrates they have
completed that level (another action that the website logs). For our analyses here, we drew on these three data
points (gender, level starts, and level completes) to look for equity in challenge interest and persistence.
           The second way in which we analyzed equity in FUSE was by drawing on data from video-ethnographic
observations   of seven  FUSE   classrooms, from  one large,   suburban,  racially- and  socioeconomically-diverse
school district, over the course of the 2015-16 school year. Each of these classes met twice per week for a total of
90 minutes, and a member of our team was present for all sessions, acting as a participant observer. During each
visit, we took field notes and recorded whole-room video using a stationary camera and point-of-view video using
visor-mounted cameras worn by six focal participants per class. At the end of the school year, we also conducted
semi-structured interviews (Patton, 1990) with 60 focal students and seven facilitators to understand what they

had learned or remembered from FUSE and what impact, if any, it had had on their interests or identities.
       In analyzing   this ethnographic data, we drew on   interaction analysis    (e.g., Goodwin, 2000;  Hall  &
Stevens, 2015; Jordan & Henderson, 1995), because, in line with the conference theme, it allowed us to analyze
ways in which knowledge was embodied, enactive, and embedded in this particular sociomaterial context. We
also selected this method based upon work by Vossoughi et al. (2013) and DiGiacomo & Gutiérrez (2016), which
proposes that equity is produced and reproduced (and therefore can be analyzed) interactionally.

Findings
Evidence from web-log data of equitable access and participation
We analyzed data from the FUSE website in three ways to examine whether equitable access and participation
were achieved for girls in FUSE. First, an examination of the gender of all users on the FUSE website showed
that over the lifetime of the program (2012-2018), more girls have participated in the FUSE than boys (22068
versus 21126). This indicates that we have been successful at getting girls in the door, or achieving equitable
access. Second, an analysis of persistence shows that boys and girls persisted at similar rates. For example, 39%
of girls and 40% of boys who started level one of a challenge went on to start level two. Similarly, 56% of girls
and 57% of boys who started level two of a challenge went on to start level three. Finally, an analysis of challenge
interest by gender--where "interest" was defined as starting level 1--showed that of the 26 challenges available
at the end of 2018, 14 were preferred by boys, 9 were preferred by girls, and 3 were gender neutral (see Table 1).
This indicates that we're doing relatively well developing challenges that appeal to both genders, but there is still
room for improvement in developing more challenges that appeal to girls.

 sample of 43194 users (22068 girls, 21126 girls) between the start of FUSE in July 2012 and December 2018.
 The more statistically significant a p value, the more `gendered' a challenge is.

       The good news is that this web data analysis also helps us understand where specific improvements can
be made. For example, from an analysis similar to the one presented above, conducted on data from 2012-2015,
we noticed that our only robotics challenge (Robot Obstacle Course) skewed heavily male. So, we redesigned it
to use a different robot with different appearance and a different programming language. We also changed the
challenge name, trailer video, and goals to reference different cultural imagery (How to Train Your Robot). As a
result, girls' participation in the challenge increased by 12% (see Table 2).

Ethnographic evidence for equitable participation
Analysis of video-ethnographic    data also  provided evidence      that girls participated equitably in learning and
developing interests in FUSE. Here, we present three cases highlighting key features of FUSE that promoted
equitable participation. These cases are representative of both the ways in which girls participated in FUSE and
the positive experiences they reported having in their end-of-year interviews. For example, of the 32 girls we
interviewed, none reported negative experiences in FUSE and 30 reported highly positive experiences.

Johanna, Victoria, and Andrea: Girls organizing their own learning
Our first case involves a group of fifth grade girls, Johanna, Victoria, and Andrea, who spent their entire school
year in FUSE working together on challenges. They began with the Dream Home challenge, each creating their
own home using the CAD program, Sketchup, but sitting together, helping each other, and showing each other
things they'd made. After finishing all three levels of Dream Home, they worked through a follow-up challenge,
Dream Home 2: Gut Rehab and a vinyl cutting challenge called Selfie Sticker, again making their own, individual
products but sitting side-by-side and helping and consulting with each other. The episode in Table 3 shows how
Johanna sought help from Andrea and Victoria when she encountered a problem in Dream Home. Here, she was
trying to see inside her CAD model. Victoria had just figured this out moments before. When Andrea saw her
make this discovery, she asked Victoria, "How are you doing that? How'd you get it to that view?", and Victoria
showed her. So when Johanna asked Victoria the same question (line 1), Andrea was able to show Johanna.
Table 3: Andrea shows Johanna how to get "inside" her CAD model home

 Line    Person             Talk                                               Actions
 1       Johanna:           Victoria, how do you get inside?
 2       Andrea:            Got it! I got it, I got it, I got it!
 3       Johanna:           How do you? How do you do it? Can
                            you tell me.
 4       Andrea:            Ok, so you're going to go to like the feet.
 5       Johanna:           I am at the feet.
 6       Andrea:            Uh huh.
 7       Johanna:           Mmm hmm
 8       Andrea:            And then1                                          1Takes Johanna's mouse, scrolls
                                                                               forward.
 9       Johanna:           And just zoom in or?
 10      Andrea:                                                               Scrolls forward until inside is visible.

         This interaction shows how the girls shared knowledge to accomplish challenge goals. For example,
Johanna sought help from Andrea and Victoria (lines 1 and 3), and Andrea provided help by explaining, then
showing Johanna how to use the tools in Sketchup to achieve her goal (lines 4, 8, and 10). It also shows how
Johanna actively participated in her own learning (lines 5, 7, 9), rather than passively letting Andrea do things for
her. Finally, the fact that what Andrea was showing Johanna here was a skill she had just learned from Victoria
shows how fluidly the girls were able to shift roles from novice to expert. This interaction not only shows how
learning in FUSE was enactive but also how knowledge was embodied. For example, by asking "Victoria, how
do you get inside?" Johanna was drawing on the embodied metaphor of walking around inside of the virtual CAD
world and physically entering her model. This metaphor was supported by the tools in Sketchup, such as "the
feet" (lines 4 and 5), a tool with an icon that looks like footprints and allows users to "walk" through virtual space.
Andrea also shared her knowledge with Johanna in an embodied way, taking her mouse (line 8) and showing her,
through embodied action, how to manipulate the hardware and software tools to achieve her goal.
         As a result of many interactions like this one, not only were all three girls able to proceed through
challenge levels of increasing complexity and master a set of technical tools and skills, but they also developed
STEAM    interests and identities related to their challenge      work.  For example,   by  her end-of-year interview,
Johanna explained why she hoped she would be able to do FUSE again the next year, by saying, "...this kind of
helped me decide that I wanted to be an architect, after my mom said it, because it's fun to make your own things."
         We argue that Johanna, Victoria, and Andrea's collaborative learning arrangement and the learning and
interest development that stemmed from it were possible in FUSE, because they were allowed to choose who to

CSCL 2019 Proceedings                                   371                                                     © ISLS
work with, what to work on, and how to approach the work. In other words, they were able to organize their own
learning in ways that were productive   for them. Their    all-girl  learning arrangement  represents a  significant
departure from male-dominated computing and making spaces, in which not only is the culture dictated by males,
but there may be so few females that girls are forced to seek help from males to achieve goals and/or be sidelined
while boys take over control (Volman & van Eck, 2001). The fact that the girls were able to choose what to work
on also allowed them to choose challenges which are broadly favored by girls but which are still technically
challenging. Finally, the fact that they could work on challenges with prescribed goals allowed them to overcome
one of the barriers to entry for females in makerspaces ­ the lack of clear goals (Lewis, 2015)

Erin: Girls leading others' learning
Our second case is Erin. Like Johanna, Victoria, and Andrea, Erin worked on challenges with other students.
However, unlike Johanna, Victoria, and Andrea, she worked with a variety of, mostly male, students. Unlike girls
making their way into male-dominated spaces, in Erin's interactions with boys during FUSE, she was consistently
the leader. The episode in Table 4 is from Erin's work with two boys, Ajay and Aiden, as they did the Solar Roller
challenge together. The goal of this challenge is to build a solar car capable of travelling a fixed distance along a
track. In this interaction, the students were trying to add a capacitor to their car so that it could travel through a
50-inch tunnel. In this interaction, Erin directed her group's work (line 1, 12, 14), acquired problem-solving
resources (lines 2, 10, 14, 16), and explained to Ajay what a capacitor was (line 18). Meanwhile, the boys messed
around (lines 3-8), contributed minimally (lines 9, 11, 13, 15) and deferred to Erin's expertise (line 17).

         In her role as group leader, Erin correctly installed the capacitor and came to an embodied understanding

of electrical circuits and the role of capacitors in them. We see this in line 18, when Erin provided a definition of
a capacitor that incorporated the spatial arrangement of the circuit she had just constructed and the capacitor's
role in it ("continues the loop"). By providing this explanation, Erin showed how knowledge is enacted through
embodied activity embedded in a particular sociomaterial context. Erin also showed how, in FUSE, girls were
able to be leaders, rather than followers, in learning. Like Johanna, in Erin's end-of-year interview, she reported
emerging STEAM interests related to FUSE. When asked "Have you thought about what you want to do when
you grow up?", Erin responded, "Yeah, I want to, since I really like space and stuff like that, I would like to be
an astrophysicist or chemist...I would like to also be a programmer or stuff like that." This is significant, because
in addition to doing Solar Roller and a number of CAD challenges, Erin spent substantial time working on
computer programming challenges, such as Game Designer (released midway through the 2015-16 school year).
        In our end-of-year interview with Erin's teacher, she also emphasized Erin's leadership role, saying,
"Erin also started out with the dream house, but she is so into the computers and into GEMS and that, that she
actually took a lot of her activities home...Her group, when they did the activity with the cars to get them to
move, it was just a lot of fun to problem solve with them." This quote suggests that Erin's teacher recognized her
role as the group leader in the Solar Roller challenge ("her group"). It also shows that she recognized the extended
nature of Erin's interest development and learning in FUSE, as she mentioned Erin working on activities at home
(without being assigned to) and participating in extracurricular STEAM activities (GEMS ­ Girls Excelling in
Math and Science). This quote also suggests of how this teacher saw her role in FUSE ­ as a facilitator or helper
rather than instructor (e.g., "fun to problem solve with them"). This indicates one mechanism through which space
was made for Erin or other students to step into leadership roles ­ because the teacher was not dominating them.

Carmen: Girls' expertise being valued
Our final case is a student, Carmen, who represents of a type of interest, identity development, and learning
frequently observed in FUSE--students developing interests and relative expertise (Stevens et al., 2016) related
to 3D printing, using that expertise to help others print, and becoming recognized as relative experts. For example,
the transcript in Table 5 shows Carmen helping another student, Elena, print by fixing a problem with the printer.

Table 5: Carmen fixes a problem with the 3D printer and manages the print queue

                       want to do it on this computer, and then let Diego
                       print today, and then you can print next week.

                       going, unless I go after Diego?
 5      Carmen:        You can go after Diego1, right after Diego.
 6      Aaliyah:       This is probably going to take a little bit longer.
 7      Carmen:        So do you want to print after Diego or do you
                       want to print now, with `Focus'? Your choice.
 8      Aaliyah:       Just make it really big
 9      Researcher:    Is there something that you could do to fix it, so
                       that it will print better next time, do you think?
 10     Elena:         Maybe like, I want to make it
 11     Carmen:        Something, it probably got tangled right here1 in        1Reaches for filament, then points

In lines 1 and 11 of the transcript, Carmen demonstrated her embodied technical knowledge and troubleshooting
skills with the printer by presenting a possible solution to a problem both in words and embodied action. She then
fixed the problem by untangling the filament. Elena positioned Carmen as an expert by seeking her guidance (line
2), letting her solve the problem, and deferring to her authority about the print queue (indicated by Elena's lack
of response after line 5). Two weeks   later,  another student, Diego,    also recognized  Carmen's expertise, by
awarding her the class's travelling "Engineer Award". He did so in recognition of both her technical expertise at

CSCL 2019 Proceedings                                  373                                                    © ISLS
3D printing and her use of that expertise to help other students print, saying, "I nominate Carmen, because how
she was working hard and how she was like helping us and like pushing herself and as soon as something was
wrong, she would fix it." Diego's nomination was seconded by a number of students and the teacher.
       Carmen's teacher also showed recognition of her 3D printing expertise in his end-of-year interview,
saying "Carmen, she became like our 3D printer guru. You know, she was the one that you would go to with any
3D printer issue. She could change it. She could do it". He contrasted this with her confidence elsewhere, saying,
"And you know, in class, she might not always show that confidence. Um, you know, she likes to participate, but
you can tell with her answers sometimes, there's not the confidence, whereas here at FUSE, when it came to 3D
printing, Carmen could tell you with confidence." This suggests that the forms of knowledge and interaction
valued in FUSE allowed Carmen to build confidence and expertise in ways unavailable in a traditional classroom.
       Carmen also recognized her own expertise. For example, one day, when the first author asked Carmen
and Elena, "What are you ladies working on today?" Carmen replied, "Uh, actually, I'm helping her print, because
I'm like the master of the printer now, and the computer." In Carmen's end-of-year interview, she explained her
interest in the 3D printer, saying "I like working on the 3D printer, and I like helping other people, um, with the
3D printer so that they can print and they can have their prints and be happy with it." In other words, her interest
was both in the technical object but also in using her technical work with it to help others. Carmen also connected
this work to her emerging identity and interests, saying "So I am kind of like a generous person helping...and
when I grow up I wish to help cancer kids and become a doctor for them...So I'm starting now and helping people
with the 3D printer...the 3D printer is like a cancer kid. I get to help it. If it's broken, I get to cure it and fix it."
Carmen's words show how FUSE supported her in discovering interests and identities, developing social and
technical skills, and being recognized for those skills by her peers and teacher. In other words, they show how the
FUSE culture valued her ways of knowing and allowed her to experience herself as a knowledgeable contributor.

Conclusion
The analyses presented here show how CSCL environments can be designed, studied, and improved to promote
equity. Using web-log data, we showed how the placement of FUSE in school allowed for equitable access and
how challenges were designed (and redesigned) to appeal to both boys and girls. Using ethnographic data, we
showed how FUSE promoted equitable participation in interest development and learning that was enactive,
embodied, embedded, and extended. We showed how FUSE afforded opportunities for girls to organize their own
learning, to become leaders of others' learning, and to develop and become recognized for their expertise. We
argue that these opportunities were afforded by three key features of the FUSE activity system. The first is the
choice-based nature of FUSE, which allows learners to pursue projects of interest in ways that work for them. The
second is the attention paid to designing and improving challenges so that they appeal to both girls and boys. The
third is the way in which students are encouraged to help one another and seek help from peers, rather than relying
on the teacher for support. These features suggest guidelines for the design of other equitable CSCL environments.
     The analyses we've presented also provide guidelines for further investigations into other sorts of equity
(or inequity) in the FUSE environment. For example, a similar analysis is needed to determine whether interest
development and learning   outcomes  are equitably available    to students  of different  racial, ethnic, and
socioeconomic backgrounds. Our video-ethnographic observations suggest that they are. For example, three of
the five girls represented here were Latinas, and one was Asian. However, a systematic examination of these forms
of equity is needed. As FUSE is now scaling up to schools across the country, many of which serve majority low
income and/or underrepresented minority populations, this has become an emerging focus of our research.
