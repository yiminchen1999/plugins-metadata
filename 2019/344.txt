         Abstract: Our quantitative study investigates how parents' use of technology in their work
         relates to their roles as learning partners for their children. We also examine whether parent
         learning  partner  roles are associated  with  children's  opportunity to   experiment  with  digital
         production activities. Based on earlier ethnographic studies we predicted that there would be
         variability of  the number   of  roles played  across  our sample,   and that parents  active in the
         technology industry would play more roles, especially those potentially catalyzed by some level
         of   expertise or knowledge,  such  as  teaching, modeling   practice,   collaborating on technical
         projects, or lending resources. Our findings were consistent with these hypotheses. For both
         mothers and fathers, the level of technology use at work was associated with the diversity of
         learning partner roles. Counts of the diversity and density of parent roles was significantly
         associated  with    the  breadth of children's   experience   with   digital  production  activities.
         Implications for equity are discussed.

Introduction
Jonathon, a 13-year-old student in Silicon Valley, developed the front and backend of websites including linked
databases and ran his own computer consulting business. Much of his knowledge developed at home as he tinkered
and taught himself new programming languages, using the Internet and books as resources and collaborating with
his parents on projects. Books, computers, and software were at the ready, lent and purchased by his parents, and
broad expertise was available in his family and their network of friends and colleagues to help him advance his
goals. His  father was   an  engineer and  programmer     who   introduced  him   to educational  computer  games   in
preschool and continued to teach him about computers and programming until his son's knowledge surpassed his
own in some areas. His mother was a small business owner and contributed her expertise to Jonathon's own
money-making ventures. In another Silicon Valley neighborhood was 12-year-old Andres, an avid gamer who
became an expert in game design and graphic tools that allowed him to create characters and backgrounds for his
game environments. Andres accessed resources and learned most of what he knew at a Computer Clubhouse space
in a local community center and brought that knowledge home to his family. At home, he taught his mother how
to use the mouse and keyboard and organize documents within folders and helped her to figure out how to pay
bills online.
         These examples from qualitative work illustrate some of the ways networked technologies and digital
tools provide rich opportunities for novel and varied forms of intergenerational learning with family members
dynamically taking on roles as teachers, learners, collaborators, and brokers (Barron, Martin, Takeuchi, & Fithian,
2009). Sources of variability in family-based learning opportunities are particularly important to understand from
an equity perspective. There is growing evidence that expertise with digital technologies is related to further
networked learning such as job opportunities (Peng, 2017), the tendency to use technology to learn (Horrigan,
2016), and teaching friends and family to use technology (Barron, Pinkard, Gomez, & Martin, 2014). Recent
national data suggests that opportunities for computational learning are unevenly distributed (Google Inc. &
Gallup Inc., 2016). Communities with fewer technology learning opportunities and knowledgeable networks may
need additional supports while those with parents in jobs that require the use of technology or that involve its
design may be in a particularly powerful position to support their children's digital hobbies that will prepare them
for empowered and critical use. In the examples above, Andres and Jonathon had similar levels of interest but
vastly different access to resources at home and in school (Barron, 2010). In this paper we report on a study of
how the supporting roles parents play in the lives of their children vary with parent use of technology in their
occupations.
         The 2019 CSCL conference theme of combining embodied, enactive, extended, and embedded learning
in collaborative settings (4EC) highlights the complexity of cognitive phenomena, encouraging analysis and
understanding at a comprehensive systems level. Family networks are important as they represent the place where
children spend much of their time and parents and other adults at home engage in guided participation as informal
teachers and resource lenders (Rogoff, 1998). How and when adults and children take up roles as more expert
learning guides  at  home   is influenced by    their cultural repertoires of practice around   teaching  and  learning

(Gutiérrez & Rogoff, 2003) as well as opportunities and needs that arise due to rapidly changing technologies. In
this paper, we consider the family as a networked learning ecosystem. That is, family members are connected to
each other  and to  their  own  broader  environments     through   learning  opportunities at work,   school,   or in the
community and these influence interactions at home. We explore the interactions between people as enactive
elements of the system and look at those interactions through the lens of extended environments, in this case parent
jobs that influence family learning within a child's broader learning ecology. We close with implications for future
research and family learning opportunities.

Parents as learning partners
There is evidence that being technologically fluent is increasingly important. Studies suggest that youth engage
in gaming and social networking more than creative digital production activities (Barron, 2006; Ito et al., 2009)
but that these production activities using technology to create are linked to important competencies. Research
focused on middle school students found that greater involvement in technology production experiences was
significantly related to more confidence in their own capacity to generate new ideas, stronger self-efficacy with
professional tools, a   propensity to   share technical   expertise with   a broader network   of people,    and intent to
continue to  develop    technical expertise   in the   future (Barron   &  Martin, 2016;  Martin,    Barron, Stringer,  &
Matthews, 2014).
         There is extensive research on how children learn through family interactions in areas such as language,
academic skills, and traditional crafts, and in most cases, parents pass on their more expert knowledge (Rogoff,
2003; Whiting & Whiting, 1970). We know less about how young people learn and build fluencies with these
newer technologies and how families fit in. Recent large-scale survey research in the UK suggests that active
engagement with media by youth, such as creative production, is linked to parents' higher confidence using
technology while more restrictive mediation of technology at home is correlated with parents with less confidence
(Livingstone et al., 2017). An in-depth case study of 22 Hong Kong students found positive links between parental
supportive mediation and technology competence and youth generative use of information technology (Yuen et
al., 2018).
         An  ethnographic   study  of   highly   engaged  middle    school students  committed   to  digital hobbies   that
ranged from robotics to making music videos found that parents played eight unique roles in surfacing, supporting,
and  coordinating   learning   opportunities   for young    people:  teacher,  learner, collaborator,  learning     broker,
employer, financier, non-technical consultant, and resource lender (Barron et al., 2009). Despite the fact that all
youth were   from  one   affluent Silicon  Valley   school,   there was  substantial variability  in the level   of parent
engagement as indexed by the number of roles played in the household and the frequency with which these roles
were played (for example across parents and over time). Greater parent involvement was associated with higher
levels of child expertise and early onset (prior to age five) of a child's engagement in new media production
activity. A number of smaller qualitative projects have validated these findings, particularly emphasizing how the
practice of adults brokering for young learners, both in the community (Ching, Santo, Hoadley, & Peppler, 2016)
and at home (Louw, Barbuto, & Crowley 2016) can expand youth opportunities and social networks. To validate
and extend these findings, we created a survey measure of parent learning partner roles to administer to a larger
sample.

Research questions
In the current study we use survey data to ask (1) whether parent learning partner roles are associated with
children's opportunity to experiment with digital production activities and (2) how parents' use of technology in
their work relates to their roles as learning partners. Based on earlier ethnographic findings we predicted that there
would be    variability of the number   of parent   roles  played   across our sample,  and  that parents    active in the
technology industry would play more roles, especially those roles that are potentially catalyzed by some level of
expertise or knowledge, such as teaching their child, modeling practice, collaborating on technical projects, or
lending resources.

Methods

Participant sample
We surveyed the entire eighth grade cohort of students from a public middle school in the Silicon Valley region
of California (N=366 students). The school was high performing (over 90% of students met or exceeded standard
in math  and  English   language   arts on state   tests) and  affluent (only  3%  were  eligible for  subsidized   lunch
programs). Approximately half of the students surveyed were male (51%). The sample had a high Asian-American
population:  34%   self-selected  Chinese   as   their ethnicity, 26%   Asian  Indian,  23%  White,   19%    other  Asian

(Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean), 5% Hispanic-Latino, and less than 1% African American (13% selected more
than one option). Almost a quarter (23%) were born outside the United States, and 34% lived in multilingual
households. Although the school was located within a hub of technological innovation, it did not offer computer
science classes.

Measures
Students were administered a survey of Access, Experience, and Interests in Computing (Barron, 2004; Barron,
Walters, Martin, & Schatz, 2010) during their 40-minute mathematics period. In this paper, we report on a subset
of measures including youth digital production experience, parent jobs, and our new parent learning partner roles
item.

Student digital production experiences
Students were asked to indicate the frequency with which they had ever engaged in a set of nine computer-related
production activities from a choice of never, once or twice, three to six times, or more than six times. Activities
queried included making a computer program, a website, digital art, a digital 2D or 3D model, a digital movie, an
animation, a computer game, digital music, and a robot or other technology invention. Activities were presented
as descriptions of possible products and/or potential software applications, such as "Made a publication or a
newsletter (e.g. PageMaker,  Word,   Comic  Life)"  and  "Designed  a 2D or  3D model    or drawing (e.g.  CAD,
ModelShop)" (For the full item, see Barron & Martin, 2014). The number of activities students reported any
experience with were counted to create a breadth of digital production experience score.

Technology in parent jobs
Students were asked to indicate the degree to which their parents' jobs involved technology. First, they were asked
if their parents used computers in their jobs from a choice of Yes, No, I don't know; with mother/female guardian
and father/male guardian queried separately (in the interest of space we refer to these two categories as mothers
and fathers in the remainder of the paper). For those who responded Yes, a follow up question asked about the
degree of occupational technology use from a choice of: Occasionally as a productivity tool as part of a larger
job (e.g. is an  author and uses   word processing, is a financial  planner and uses  record  keeping software)
(occasional user) and job is defined by the computer/technology; it is their primary tool (e.g. works as a Web
designer, networking consultant, computer programmer, engineer, etc.) (technology professional). Participants
with unclear or incomplete answers were dropped from the analysis.
          Silicon Valley is a technology hub with a growing concentration of the labor force in this industry.
Eighty-eight percent of students for whom we have parent job information reported having at least one parent who
was a technology professional. Over three quarters of fathers were classified as technology professionals, while
mothers were more evenly distributed (Table 1). The predominance of fathers with technology-defined jobs (twice
as  many  fathers as mothers   for this sample) is  reflective of a  recent Silicon Valley  workforce analysis,
documenting persistent underrepresentation of women (John & Carnoy, 2017).

Parent learning partner roles
The measure of parent learning partner roles is based on interview and ethnographic studies looking at roles played
by adults that seem to be generative in young people's digital production interests and hobbies (Barron et al.,
2009; Barron et al., 2014). The item asked students if their parents (mother and father queried separately) ever
played each of 10 roles to support their learning about computers and technology (Table 2). Roles include those
that provide new opportunities for learning by connecting children with activities and resources and those that
involve joint engagement as child and parent(s) work and learn together (Takeuchi & Stevens, 2011). In the Table
2, roles are organized within these two conceptual groups by frequency for this sample, from those most to least
played.

 Financier of entertainment resources  Bought me entertainment related technology (like games, console)
 Resource lender                       Had things (like books, equipment, software) at the house that I use.
 Financier of educational resources    Bought me things to support my computer activities and learning
                                       (like hardware, software, books, courses)
 Learning broker                       Looked for technology-related activities for me to do and/or signed me
                                       up for them (like classes, clubs, camps, etc.)
 Employer                              Paid me to do something technical or on the computer for her/him.
 Learning together
 Teacher                               Taught me how to do something on the computer (like typing, how to
                                       create a Web page, etc.)
 Learner                               I have taught them how to do something with the computer.
 Model                                 Let me watch how they do something (like turn on the computer, set
                                       up the printer) that I eventually learn how to do from observing
                                       them.
 Non-tech consultant                   Gave me advice on non-technical issues that helped me with my
                                       technology activities.
 Collaborator                          Worked with me on a technology- or computer-related project (like
                                       built a robot together, worked on a Flash tutorial together)

Results
Consistent with our ethnographic study (Barron et al., 2009) there was variability in terms of the number of
learning partner roles played by mothers and fathers. Below we address three questions related to parent role
variability in relation to child experiences and parent occupation.

Did the number of roles played correlate with children's digital production
experience?
We created a measure of the diversity of roles (number of roles played by mother or father, with a possible total
of 10) and a measure of the density of roles (number of roles played by mother and father, with a possible total of
20). In this sample, students reported an average diversity of 6.90 roles (SD = 2.17) ranging from 1-10, and an
average density of 11.12 roles (SD = 1.84), ranging from 1-20. There was a significant association between these
measures and youth experiences with digital production. Pearson correlation indicated a positive association
between digital production experience scores and diversity of parent roles (r(360) = .31, p < .001) and between
digital production experience scores and density of parent roles (r(360) = .32, p < .001).

Was diversity of roles played associated with level of parent technology use at work?
We also created measures of the diversity of learning partner roles each parent separately played for their children
and looked at those measures by parent job classification (Figure 1). Almost twice as many roles were played by
parents defined as technology professionals than by parents who did not use technology at work. An ANOVA
with mother technology job focus as the between subjects factor revealed a significant effect of job on the number
of roles played by mothers (F(2,313) = 31.51, p = <.001). For mothers, these phenomena increased with the level
of technology focus within their jobs, with tech professionals playing more learning partner roles than those who
used technology occasionally in their jobs, and those mothers playing more roles than mothers who did work at
all with computers. An ANOVA with father technology job focus as the between subjects factor also revealed a
significant effect of job on the number of roles played (F(2,323) = 14.76, p = <.001). Fathers who used technology
at all at work played significantly more learning support roles than those who did not. For fathers, differences
between technology professionals and occasional users and were smaller and not significantly different.

     Figure 1. Number of learning partner roles played by parent (diversity) by parent job classification.

Did the kinds of roles played by parents differ by parents with technology jobs?
Analysis reveals striking differences in roles played by parents with more and less technology focus in their
professional life. For both mothers and fathers, using technology at work significantly increased the likelihood of
engaging in every learning partnership role with the exception of parent as learner. Roles such as modeling,
collaborating, and teaching were much more likely when parent jobs required the use of technology.

Mothers or female guardians
Mothers whose work was not at all defined by computers and technology (no usage) were less likely to play every
role queried than those who did (occasional users and technology professionals) except for learning from their
child and employing them to help with technology issues (Table 3). In terms of those roles that may provide new
extended opportunities for learning, mothers who used technology at all in their jobs were more likely to finance
equipment. This suggests differing levels of technology tools in the house and possibly financial differences
between families. Mothers classified as technology professionals were more likely than both other groups to lend
or share their own resources with their children and were more likely than mothers who did not use technology in
their jobs to broker learning events for their children. In terms of learning together, roles that require some parent
technology knowledge or expertise (teacher and model) were significantly different across all three groups, with
likelihood increasing with increased technology job focus. Mothers classified as technology professionals were
four times as likely as those who did not use technology in their work to teach their children about computers and
technology and to model technical and computational practices, and three times as likely to collaborate with their
children. Mothers who were technology professionals were more than twice as likely than the occasional users to
collaborate with their children.

it a unique look into potentially generative interactions between parent and child as they share knowledge. In this
sample, 55% of students reported at least one parent who both learned from and taught them, and 19% reported
this to be true for both parents. There were no differences between occupation groups in terms of the frequency
of fathers who played this bidirectional role but there were for mothers (Tables 3 and 4). Mothers who used
technology in their jobs were more likely to have a teaching and learning relationship. It is of note that the majority
of mothers in all groups are playing the learning role for their child, but this was not true for fathers.

Fathers or male guardians
Father occupation groups did not differ in terms of brokering new learning activities for their children, but they
did provide material resources differently (Table 4). Fathers who did not use technology at all in their jobs were
less likely than the other groups to finance technology resources for their child than the other groups. Technology
professionals not only purchased more learning resources for their children but were also more than twice as likely
to lend their own resources than those fathers who did not use technology in their jobs. In terms of learning
together, technology professionals were more likely than both other groups to teach their children, and this was
true for occasional users compared to fathers that did not use technology at all in their job. On the other hand, the
technology professionals were less likely than fathers who did not use technology at all in their jobs to learn from
their child. Fathers who did not use technology in their jobs were more than twice as likely to learn from their
children than  fathers who  were  technology professionals.  A  similar pattern was  observed  for modeling        and
collaborating.

Discussion and future directions
Learning to use technology as a tool of creative production has been recognized as a key capacity that will help
position young  people  for work, civic engagement, and     future learning. Understanding how    these       capacities
develop is critical for tracking variability in access to learning opportunities provided at home, in schools, or in
virtual or online communities. In this paper we provided findings that stress the importance of interactions between
people as  enactive elements  of  the system  and consider    those  interactions through  the lens        of extended
environments, in this case parent jobs that influence family learning within a child's broader learning ecology.
Describing and differentiating supportive roles played by parents and being able to quantify roles played in social
environments has implications for measuring learning networks and corresponding design-based interventions. In
this paper we focused on learning partnerships at home, asking whether parents who worked with computers and
technology in their jobs played more roles for their children than parents who did not work in the field or use
technology in their work at all. Our findings indicated that the diversity of roles experienced by young people was
significantly related to parent use of technology at work.
         Our Silicon Valley sample is from a highly unique community in terms of its technological expertise and
capital, and specific patterns found here may not transfer to other locations or be broadly representative of the

CSCL 2019 Proceedings                                  349                                                       © ISLS
U.S., although as shared in the introduction, there is variability even in this highly concentrated area. It would be
productive to know more about the types of jobs that are represented in this sample and the expertise they require.
Analyses of technical occupations suggest that jobs vary along multiple dimensions and we would expect that
what parents know and might possibly share would vary accordingly. Beyond content knowledge, technical
expertise is a form of cultural capital that includes values, beliefs identities, and access to knowledge networks. It
may be the case that some regions or occupations provide access to specialized technically relevant social capital
through networks and learning partnerships that can support knowledge development (Bourdieu,1986). Recent
quantitative data on the geographical histories of patent holders suggests that regional social networks are critical
for surfacing and sustaining   talent (Bell, Chetty, Jaravel, Petkova,   & Van  Reenen, 2017).  Andres, a learner
described in the introduction to this paper, shared his knowledge in contributing to his church community, using
Adobe design products to create a song guide that scrolled lyrics projected on a large screen. Jonathon's consulting
business was utilized by teachers at his school. From an equity perspective it is imperative to document the
conditions that allow for and constrain the development and recognition of innovation of all types. Combining
geographical analyses with more nuanced ethnographic research would set the stage for future experimental
intervention-oriented research intended to help democratize the potential of all young people to innovate and share
their innovations more broadly. As a first step, we intend to refine our retrospective survey questions to carry out
a nationally representative survey that could see how these patterns play out or not across a larger and more diverse
sample of youth and/or parents.   Gender is also an area for more research, although in this sample there were no
significant differences between boys and girls in this sample in terms of diversity or density of parent roles played
or their own digital production experience. There were differences between mothers and fathers in the proportion
engaged in technology focused jobs and in the frequency of roles.      For example, mothers were more likely than
fathers to broker learning opportunities for their children. In other analysis not reported here we show that the
broker role is very important in this sample--students who report parents who play the learning broker role also
report learning outside of school about a greater number of technology-related topics.
        In closing, our findings underscore the value of deepening our understanding of informal family-based
learning partnerships as a contributor to the technical expertise of young people. This is a particularly important
goal for addressing issues of innovational equity (Barron, 2004). A well-documented lack of diversity in those
who are lead designers is increasingly recognized as significant challenge and a threat to creativity and innovation
in the technology industry. To the extent that we have a more homogenous group of professionals imagining and
building future tools we fail to capitalize on diversity of perspectives, ultimately limiting potential solutions. It is
generally agreed that this is a multidimensional problem that includes early gaps in experience, gender and racial
stereotyping of technical work, and workplaces that create climates that suppress rather than invite contributions
from all (e.g. Google & Gallup, Inc., 2016; Williams, Li, Rincon, & Finn, 2018). Our findings suggest that by
supporting all parents as learning partners we might increase the likelihood of engaging a more diverse group of
young people in activities that will position them to be future designers in service of their own goals, their
communities' needs, or their workplaces. Given that families are central sites for learning interactions, working
to help expand their opportunities to co-learn may be one of the more important things we can do to fulfill the
potential promise of technology as a resource for the greater good.    At the same time, to support more equitable
robust learning ecologies,  it is essential  that schools,  libraries, community  organizations and other public
institutions provides access to opportunities to complement the important work that families do.
