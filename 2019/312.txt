       Abstract: University students often self-organize in groups for collaborative exam preparation.
       To learn effectively, they need to regulate emerging learning challenges through the choice of
       fitting strategies. So far, little is known about what strategies fit which challenges. We present
       a theoretical account for the definition of fit between regulation challenges and strategies in
       collaborative learning, thereby differentiating between direct and indirect strategies, and test its
       validity in an  empirical study. We  asked 163 university   students in 90 groups       to rate the
       challenges they encountered in their self-organized group meetings, and to report strategies by
       aid of which they regulated their biggest challenge. Answers were coded into 26 strategy types.
       We found that students mostly used strategy types that directly address their biggest challenges.
       Multilevel-modelling indicated that direct strategies are associated with higher satisfaction for
       coordination- and comprehension-related challenges only, but not for motivational challenges.

Problem statement
Many university students choose to prepare for exams in groups. Potential benefits of this are to maintain one's
own discipline or to improve one's own understanding by discussing learning material (Järvenoja, Volet, &
Järvelä, 2013). Yet, groups often face coordination-related, motivational, or comprehension-related challenges.
When such challenges are not regulated, group members may be dissatisfied and reach poor group outcomes
(Freeman, 1996). However, little is known about what strategies actually fit what kinds of challenges that may
occur during collaborative learning and how their application relates to learners' satisfaction with their learning
process. We (a) provide a theory-based analysis of the fit between learning challenges and regulation strategies
and (b) investigate whether this fit is predictive for learners' satisfaction with their group learning experience.

Theoretical Background

Types of challenges
We propose that most challenges that may occur during collaborative learning fall into one of the following three
categories: (a) coordination between group members, (b) motivational aspects, or (c) comprehension of learning
topics and materials. Coordination-related challenges may arise when group members set different priorities in
learning the exam contents, or when they set different learning goals (Järvelä & Järvenoja, 2011). Motivational
challenges may emerge when group members, for example, cannot find interest in the exam topics. Finally,
comprehension-related challenges may arise when groups have too little subject-specific prior knowledge, or
when the learning material is structured in a confusing way. For successful exam preparation, learners need to
effectively regulate these challenges. So far, studies (e.g., Malmberg, Järvelä, Järvenoja, & Panadero, 2015) have
tried to predict the regulatory success by the quantity or quality of strategy use. Yet, in line with theoretical models
of self-regulated learning (e.g., Zimmermann & Moylan, 2009), we additionally suppose that in order to be
effective, there is the need for a chosen strategy to match the specific challenge at hand.

Strategy fit
The fit of strategies to challenges has been described as an important factor that influences the success of learning
regulation (Engelschalk, et al., 2015). Nevertheless, in collaborative learning, research about which strategy types
are effective in what situation, i.e., what strategy types "fit" a given challenge, is scarce. Therefore, in this paper,
we make an attempt to determine the appropriateness of specific strategy types to regulate specific coordination-
related, motivational, and comprehension-related challenges.

       We firstly assume that in a given situation some strategies may fit a current regulation challenge better
than others. In one situation, group learners might for example differ in their ideas on how to proceed with the
task (= a specific coordination-related challenge): One group member might want to recapitulate a topic that was
already covered by the group, while other group members might prefer to improve their comprehension of a new
topic. Now the group needs to react to the challenge by choosing a regulation strategy. It could, for example,
apply a motivation strategy like planning to reward themselves after the learning session, or it could discuss these
divergent plans and find an agreement on how to proceed. For the given situation, the latter strategy seems to be
more effective to overcome the given challenge than the aforementioned strategy because it aims at directly
eliminating the challenge. At least, communicating own plans and intentions is necessary to negotiate the further
and joint proceeding (= to resolve the challenge). This does not mean at all that the reward strategy necessarily is
inappropriate in this learning situation as a whole. Actually, it might support learning at a more general level
because it might address different (motivational) problems that might be present in the same learning situation
simultaneously. Nevertheless, it would rather not or not effectively help to dissolve the specific challenge of
divergent plans. Hence, strategies that can help to directly eliminate a given challenge might be more likely to
result in effective regulation than strategies that might support the learning process in a different, but non-direct
way that leaves the central challenge itself unaffected. Thus, we regard the choice of strategies that directly aim
at eliminating the challenge as "fitting".
       Other challenges, e.g., "distraction", can be overcome by multiple strategy types. In this case, specific
resource-oriented strategies (e.g., controlling the environment to reduce external stimuli), metacognitive strategies
(discussing how to organize learning to hinder distraction), or a selection of motivational strategies (e.g., making
the topic more fun to learn, i.e. increasing situational interest; see Table 1) seem promising, as they all address
the problem in a direct manner (e.g., when any of these strategies is applied successfully, the problem should
disappear). We assume that the amount of strategy types considered as being effective varies with the specificity
or globality of the perceived challenge: Coordination-related and comprehension-related challenges seem more
specific, thus less strategy types directly address them. Motivational challenges are more global and thus can be
addressed by more different strategy types. Table 1 provides an overview about which strategy types theoretically
can be considered to directly regulate different kinds of regulation challenges based on the considerations above.

Relation of adaptive strategy use and satisfaction with the learning experience
One (among several) way(s) to determine the effectiveness of specific regulation strategies is through measuring
learners' satisfaction with the overall learning experience. This assumption can be derived from the cyclic phase
model of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman & Moylan, 2009): In terms of this model, satisfaction is a self-
reaction which depends on the goals that were set in the beginning of a learning activity (or the evaluation
standards in the model of Winne,  Jamieson-Noel,    &    Muis,  2001). Concerning     self-initiated study groups in
preparation for an exam, one may assume that the main goal these students set for their meetings is to learn
effectively (and eventually to receive     good grades).  Thus,   the (subjectively)   acquired  knowledge   that is
accumulated during collaborative learning may be understood as a measure for learning success in the self-
reflection phase. If the goals/standards are met, satisfaction should result.
       Even    though the assumption that     regulation strategies need to   fit the regulation challenges to yield
effective learning is immanent in models of self-regulated learning, it has rarely been empirically tested. In one
study, Järvelä, Volet, and Järvenoja (2010) filmed the regulatory activity of 63 teacher education students during
collaborative learning tasks, and had participants rate the perceived intensity of various emotional challenges they
experienced during group work as well as their satisfaction with their group learning process. Using qualitative
analyses, they showed that one group demonstrated effective social and self-regulation of different challenges,
and, at the same time, rated its group learning as "relatively satisfactory" up to "very satisfactory". Even though
this study investigated regulation fit only for emotional challenges, it suggests a link between the problem-specific
fit of regulatory strategies and learners' satisfaction with the learning experience. If we find that learners who
apply strategies that based on our theoretical analysis directly address their challenges are more satisfied with
their learning than those learners who apply other strategies, this result could be regarded as evidence that is in
line with our theoretical assignment of strategies to challenges.

Research questions and hypothesis
We ask the following research questions: To what extent do group learners use strategies that directly address a
reported challenge compared to other strategies (RQ 1)? Can this extent be considered to be sensitive to the
challenge type, i.e., is it more likely that direct compared to other strategies are chosen (RQ 2)? Are learners who
apply direct strategies more satisfied with their learning than those who used other strategies and do differential
effects depend on the problem type being regulated (RQ 3)? RQ 1 and RQ 2 will be answered in an exploratory

fashion. With regard to RQ 3, we hypothesize that learners who apply direct strategies to remedy their biggest
regulation challenge are more satisfied with their group learning than students who use other strategies. Yet, we
additionally explore whether there are differential effects of the problem type, i.e. that direct strategies are only
related to satisfaction when addressing certain, but not other kinds of challenges.

Method

Sample
Participants were N = 174 university students (74.29% female, 25.14% male, 0.57% other) belonging to 90 self-
organized study groups. They had an average age of 22 years (M = 22.26, SD = 2.68) and were, on average, in
their 5th semester (M = 4.64, SD = 3.03) of their current studies and in their 6th (M = 6.21, SD = 3.85) semester of
studies in general. Participants were enrolled in various study programs (e.g. teacher education, law, mathematics,
computer science) at different German universities. The number of students per group participating in the study
ranged from 1 to 5, with two participating group members being the most frequent fraction (23.27%). After each
group  meeting, participants  were   asked to   (individually) answer    an online questionnaire. Participants were
reimbursed with 14  if they filled in the questionnaire 3 times. For each additionally completed questionnaire,
they received an additional 2.50 . The maximum was 10 questionnaires (35 ).

Instruments

Questionnaire
The used questionnaire was a modified version of the Adaptive Instrument for Regulation of Emotions ("AIRE";
Järvenoja & Järvelä, 2009). It asked for the experience and regulation of coordination-related, motivational, and
comprehension-related challenges during the current group meeting. Participants first were asked to rate on a five-
point scale (1= "does not apply at all", 5= "does squarely apply") how intensively they experienced each of the
14 listed challenges during their group meeting (see Table 1). Then, they should mark their biggest of those 14
challenges and describe it briefly. This was followed by an item that asked students to rate their satisfaction with
the respective group meeting on a seven-point rating scale (1= "totally unsatisfied", 7= "totally satisfied"). In the
end, participants were asked to enter strategies they used to regulate their biggest self-categorized challenge at the
self-, co-, and shared level in an open answer format (e.g. self: "What did you personally think, do or say to ensure
high quality of your own learning in this situation?", co: "...of the learning of individual others", shared: "...of
the learning of the group as a whole"; Järvelä & Hadwin, 2013).

Coding procedure
After data collection, a coding scheme to classify learning strategies was developed, based on established schemes
of Mandl and Friedrich (2006), and of Engelschalk et al. (2015). It contained 26 categories: Twenty-four specific
strategy types (see "Note" in Table 1 for a complete list), one residual category for unspecific strategies, and one
category when no strategy was provided. Trained coders' categorization yielded a sufficient interrater agreement
(Cohen's  = .85). After coding, a binary "fit" variable was generated by assigning the values 1 or 0 based on the
aforementioned theoretical scheme (1 if a person mentioned at least one strategy directly addressing the perceived
biggest  challenge, 0 if only  other strategies were mentioned;   see    Table 1 for details about which   strategies
theoretically match which challenges).

Analysis
To answer RQ 1, we calculated absolute and relative frequencies of the use of the different strategies (together
with 95% confidence intervals) and visualized them with a decision tree (see Figure 1). Concerning RQ 2, we
added ratios "R" for each challenge type: To give an impression of how to interpret the magnitude of the relative
frequencies of strategies directly addressing a challenge to other strategies (= whether regulation is adapted to a
specific challenge), we calculated ratios of the empirical to the theoretical relations of direct and total strategy
use. The theoretical relation signifies the probability to choose a direct strategy, if a random distribution across
all strategy categories was assumed, weighted with the average number of strategies reported for each challenge
type. In summary,   this ratio expresses   the  empirical probability that   a person directly addresses a  specific
challenge qualified by what would be expected if there was no adaption in the choice of regulation strategy to a
challenge at all. Values above 1 signify that more participants actually chose direct strategies than one would
expect  under the   assumption of random   distribution   of strategies, whereas   values below 1  signify that less
participants chose direct strategies than one would expect if there was no adaption to challenge. The deviation
from 1 was tested by asymptotical 2-tests.

         To test if choosing a strategy type that fits a current challenge increases the satisfaction with learning
(Hypothesis 1), hierarchical linear modelling using R (reml estimation) was conducted. Data was analysed using
a three-level data structure (group meetings, persons, groups; Singer & Willett, 2003). Students' satisfaction with
their learning and  group   differences were  estimated  by   specifying the  unconditional   means  model  where
satisfaction with  learning is independent  of  predictors. Nevertheless,  we  allowed  for  random   variations in
satisfaction between  groups   and  individuals in  groups  (random  parameters  0,    00). We   z-standardized  the
satisfaction variable to interpret differences in satisfaction in units of standard deviation. General development of
students' satisfaction with their learning across group meetings and group differences in these developments were
estimated by specifying the unconditional growth model. In this model, satisfaction with learning is modeled as
dependent   on the number   of learning  sessions (001). This time  effect is allowed  to   vary randomly between
individuals  and  between   groups  (random parameters   0,  00). The group   meeting   was   coded by number    to
approximately interpret the parameters of the time variable as changes per meeting (approximately because some
groups already existed before our study). Then, we specified a fit model that included the effects mentioned above
and additionally the effect of the fit between the challenge and strategy type on satisfaction. The fit variable was
included as a fixed effect because there is no plausible argument for random variation over groups and individuals
in groups. Last, we added the interaction of fit and problem type to the last model.

Results

Preliminary analysis
We first looked at whether the types of challenges we presented to participants actually fell into the three assumed
categories  "coordination-related", "motivational", and  "comprehension-related"  challenges.    To judge this,  we
used the individual ratings to what extent the 14 challenges actually occurred in the group in exploratory and
confirmatory factor analyses. The EFA supported the choice of 3 factors as the optimal factor structure by 3 (out
of 9, 33.33%) methods (Optimal Coordinates, Parallel Analysis, VSS Complexity 2). A further CFA indicated a
superior model fit for the three-factor structure compared to theoretically plausible one- or two-factor structures.
However, the overall model fit was not optimal (2=2965.899, p< .001, 2/df =32.59, CFI=0.89, RMSEA=0.07,
SRMR=0.06). Since the following calculations are performed separately for each specific challenge, and grouping
into larger problem dimensions was used for clarity of visualization only, the decision for a three-factor structure
did not pose a problem for later analyses.

Distribution of fit between learning challenges and regulation strategies
Concerning RQ 1, Figure 1 shows the transition probabilities with which participants who encountered a specific
challenge type chose a direct strategy. It also provides information on whether a larger or smaller proportion of
participants regulated a specific challenge with a direct versus with other strategies. It can be seen that direct
strategies were more frequent than alternative strategies across all types of challenges except for "boring learning
material" for which the confidence interval includes equal frequency (50%). Overall, these results suggest that
students predominantly choose strategy types for directly controlling specific challenge types, indicating high fit
between selected strategies and regulation challenges. The exception for "boring learning material" was surprising
since our theoretical model assumed a whole set of different strategy types to directly address this challenge type.
Although the baseline probability of choosing a direct strategy was rather high, students chose other types of
strategies equally often here. In figure 1, the ratios "R" signifying the relation of the empirical percentage of direct
strategies to what could be expected under the assumption of a random distribution of strategies across all coding
categories demonstrate values significantly (if testable due to low cell frequencies) greater than 1 for eleven out
of 14 challenge types (coordination problems were not listed individually in the tree for lack of space). This hints
towards a rather high ability of students to adaptively select direct strategies to remedy their regulation challenges
(RQ 2). Though, the ratios of the three motivational challenges were significantly below 1, indicating regulation
to be sensitive to the kind of challenge as well, but in an unexpected direction. For these problem types, students
chose direct strategies less frequently and other strategies more frequently than expected when strategy selection
would  be  random.  In order   to test whether  the observed  regulation   differences between   coordination-  and
comprehension-related problems on the one hand and motivational problems on the other hand also show up in
regard to satisfaction, this split of problems was maintained in the multi-level models. So, we suppose that direct
strategies are positively associated with satisfaction only for coordination- and comprehension-related challenges,
whereas for motivational challenges, they might be negatively associated.

Relation of fit with outcome
Regarding RQ 3, the unconditional means model (see Table 2) showed that 19% of the variance of satisfaction
was explained by the group level. Thus, groups differed in the effectiveness of regulation. The unconditional
growth model retained this effect but showed a main effect of time (100) indicating that satisfaction decreased
across learning sessions in average. Further, the fit model showed the effect of time again (100) but yielded no
significant effect for fit (200). Thus, the fit between the biggest challenge and the selected strategy type to regulate
this challenge did not significantly predict satisfaction. The interaction of fit and problem type model revealed a
main effect for problem type (300) indicating that group learners were more dissatisfied with their learning when
facing motivational instead of coordination- or comprehension-related problems. This model further revealed a
significant (one-sided according to hypothesis stated above) interaction effect between fit and problem type (400).
Thus, for coordination- and comprehension-related challenges, satisfaction was higher when direct instead of
other strategies were chosen, but was lower for motivational challenges.

Discussion
The aims of our study were twofold. First, we wanted to investigate to what extent group learners who encounter
specific coordination-related, motivational, and comprehension-related challenges during their exam preparation
select strategy types that directly address those challenges. In this context, we also reflected on whether this extent
can  be  considered  to   be sensitive to   the challenge    type.  Second,   we tried   to validate our   postulated     fit
categorization by regressing differences in satisfaction with the learning experience on the fit of the strategy types
students selected with the biggest learning challenge they experienced during learning.
         As  expected,  learners  in groups  particularly  seem    to choose  strategy types  directly   addressing    their
biggest challenge. For thirteen out of 14 challenge types, they chose significantly more direct than other strategies.
When additionally controlling for baseline probability of the measurement instrument, they still regulated eleven
out of 14 challenges sensitive to the specific challenge. Thus, group learners seem to be able to adaptively regulate
their learning challenges dependent on the kind of challenge they are confronted with. In line with the SRL model
of  Zimmerman    and   Moylan   (2009),  it may  be  that  learners   choose  strategies that match      their experienced
challenges because they have turned out to be most effective for their control. However, this result seems to
contradict observations of Engelschalk et al. (2015) who found that students did not differentiate much in their
strategy choices and rather activate proven strategies repeatedly across situations. The diverging findings might
be related due to the different study designs or contexts: In the study by Engelschalk and colleagues (2015),
individual learning students were presented with hypothetical motivational problems and asked to describe how
they would regulate each of them. Contrary to that, we asked group learners to report their real experienced
coordination-related, comprehension-related, and motivational learning challenges.
         For motivational challenges, though, we found regulation to be sensitive to the reported challenge as
wellbut in the opposite direction than we had expected. For one out of three motivational challenges, direct
strategies were not more frequently used than other strategies. Since we proposed that there are more direct
strategy types for regulating motivational than coordination- or comprehension-related challenges, this is even
more surprising. When this baseline rate was controlled for, direct strategies were less significantly chosen for all
three  motivational    challenges than   expected    under   random   distribution. Hence,    learners    who    encounter
motivational challenges seem to specifically avoid using motivational strategies. There are at least the three
different explanations for this result: First, our theoretical considerations might have been wrong so that we failed
to identify the right strategy types to directly address motivational challenges. Second, the matching we derived
based on our theoretical understanding might be applicable but our participants were not able to select direct
strategies and chose other strategies due to their lacking strategy knowledge or due to an inability to activate direct
strategies here. Third,  the social  nature  of  the regulation  situation   might show     differential effects   of social
desirability: According to this interpretation, it might be plausible that group members appreciate receiving help
from another group member in understanding the learning content (= a comprehension-related challenge), or in
negotiating the subsequent learning process (= coordination-related challenge). In case of motivational problems,
however, it might be much less desirable to intervene as a group member. Trying to motivate a group member
might be perceived as unwanted intrusion and attempt to change the attitudes towards the learning task and thus
produce reactance within the group. For a less obvious and less socially conflict-loaded control of their group
members' motivation, learners could have tried to indirectly motivate others through providing them assistance
in learning the material.
         Following Zimmerman and Moylan (2009), we supposed that if strategies were applied that match the
learning challenge,  then  successful  regulation should     be likely. Regulation  success,  in turn,   should    result in
satisfaction with the learning process. Therefore, we tested the association of the directness of strategy choice
with satisfaction with the learning experience as an indication of criterion validity of our theoretical model on the
fit between  strategies and  challenges.  Controlling    for random   variations of satisfaction  between      groups   and
between individuals in groups, and for fixed and random effects of time, we found a significant link between the
fit of strategy  to challenge  type  and    satisfaction with   the learning  experience    only for coordination-      and
comprehension-related, but not for motivational challenges. Thus, we assume that our conceptualization of fit is
actually predictive of regulation success measured by satisfaction rating, but differentially for specific challenge
types. Additionally, this result mirrors the finding of the single case analysis of Järvelä et al. (2010).

Limitations and conclusions
Of  course, this study  has  limitations: First, we   did not   have  a direct measure   of  regulation   success.    Using
satisfaction as a more distal measure surely is influenced by more than just the directness of chosen strategies.
Perhaps the relationship between strategy-challenge fit and learning outcomes would be stronger if learning
outcomes   would    be assessed   by aid  of objective   measures     (e.g. standardized test  measuring       the acquired
knowledge). Second, even though we investigated regulation in real groups, analyses were based on self-reported

strategy use. Video-based analysis of real group interactions would be valuable and could nicely complement our
more subjective data. Third, we looked for the fit between challenge and strategy types on an aggregated level. If
the individual open-answer descriptions of each challenge and the corresponding regulation strategies would be
used to propose a new fit, the results might provide a more precise picture of an even larger amount of direct
strategies. Thus, as before, we believe that the estimated relative frequencies were also underestimated in this
study. As a consequence, we plan to determine the fit for each individual strategy to each individual challenge as
a future step. Furthermore, we have proposed strategy fit only in reference to the biggest challenge that participants
experienced. Students who appropriately coped with all challenges during their group meetings except for their
biggest challenge were likely to have lowered the empirical relationship between fit and satisfaction.
        An important educational implication of our study is the following: We saw that students do not regulate
motivational challenges much with strategies that (theoretically) would fit. In case that this results proves reliable
in further studies, students should be trained in effectively regulating motivational challenges in particular, to
increase their use of direct strategies for such challenges. For individual learning situations, Eckerlein, Steuer, and
Dresel (2018)  already  showed that  effective   motivational regulation  can   successfully  be fostered  through
dedicated training programs. Also, scaffolds or scripts (Kollar, Fischer, & Slotta, 2007) may additionally prompt
group learners to adjust their use of strategies to challenges for more effective and satisfying collaborative learning
experiences.
