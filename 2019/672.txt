         Abstract: When collaborating in groups, students may assume emergent roles as they interact
         over  time. Emergent   leadership can improve  group    functioning, but this depends   on how
         leadership is supported by group members. We studied how roles emerged in two groups of
         eighth-graders participating in CSCL activities over a 12-week science unit. A leader emerged
         in  each group,  but  through  different processes.  Group  A showed     greater distribution of
         contributions to decision-making and science talk than Group B, as well as greater conceptual
         gains on a content test. In contrast, Group B focused more on off-task talk than Group A. While
         our sample is too small to make causal claims, better distribution of contributions to talk and
         on-task participation seemed to positively impact collaboration and learning.

Introduction
Collaborative  activities help students to  share  perspectives,  negotiate meaning-making,     and deepen   their
understanding (Stahl, 2006). However, assigning students to groups does not mean that they will collaborate in
productive ways (Dillenbourg, 2002). To support collaboration, scaffolds, such as scripts, can help students set
groups norms and interact in productive ways (Mercer & Dawes, 2008; Wang, Kollar, & Stegmann, 2017). Some
scripts include roles that are intended to foster collaborative meaning-making (De Wever, Van Keer, Schellens,
& Valcke, 2010; Strijbos & De Laat, 2010). Scripted roles assign responsibilities to group members, which can
improve students' accountability, interdependence, equity in contributions, collaboration, and learning (De Wever
et al., 2010; Strijbos & De Laat, 2010). However, scripted roles have some limitations. Rigid roles constrain
students' self-regulation (Wang et al., 2017), and students may deviate from scripts (Hoadley, 2010). This latter
issue points to a need to understand how roles emerge with and without scripts.
         To understand emergent roles, we can examine how students working in groups take on responsibilities
over time, and, in turn, how these responsibilities constrain students' interactions (Mercier, Higgins, & da Costa,
2014; Sarmiento & Shumar, 2010). For example, students taking on leadership roles may direct the group's
intellectual or organizational progress (Mercier et al., 2014), with or without support from others (Strijbos & De
Laat, 2010). Leaders may also attempt to control others' participation or use of shared resources (Jones & Issroff,
2005). Yet, other students may seem to abdicate their responsibilities (e.g., free-riders; Strijbos & De Laat, 2010).
How students take on roles, whether scripted or emergent, has implications for the efficiency and structure of
group collaboration and can shape how learning processes unfold (Spada, 2010; Strijbos & De Laat, 2010).
Further, emergent intellectual leaders can help groups to successfully complete tasks (Mercier et al., 2014). In our
study, we aimed to understand how roles emerged in two groups as they participated in a CSCL science unit. Our
research questions were: how did roles emerge via group discourse over the 12-week unit, and what effects did
roles have on students' conceptual outcomes? These questions have implications for supporting learning processes
in CSCL contexts that encourage student to set their own group norms.

Methods
This study investigated how two groups of eighth-grade students (4 students per group, N = 8) collaborated during
a 12-week, design-based CSCL science unit. Both groups had the same teacher, but in different classrooms of an
urban middle school in the U.S. Midwest. During the unit, students designed compost bioreactors that decomposed
quickly and odorlessly while promoting microbial activity. Two CSCL activities informed students' designs.
Students collaboratively brainstormed questions and conducted research using an e-textbook over four sessions.
Students also  used  a simulation to explore decomposition    in compost over  four   sessions. While  the teacher
determined the groups, no scripts or other scaffolds for collaboration were provided.
         We collected video data from the first and last sessions with the e-textbook and the simulation for each
group (558 min). Our goal was to analyze how students' discourse and control of resources shaped role formation
over time.  To analyze  groups' discourse,  we developed    a coding scheme   for students' decision-making   and
science talk (Lemke,   1990)  after viewing videos  of group   work. Our first category,  Decision-Making    Talk,
included the following codes: (i) asking for decisions; (ii) making conceptually-directed decisions; (iii) making
task-related decisions; (iv) accepting a decision; (v) repeating a decision; (vi) questioning a decision; (vii) offering

an alternative; and (viii) controlling resources. Our second category, Science Talk, included the following codes:
(i) reporting observations or results; (ii) conceptual discussions; and  (iii) metacognitive  reflection on group
knowledge. We also included a category for Off-Task Talk.
         The first two authors established inter-rater reliability with 10% of the full data set (717 turns of talk,
Cohen's kappa = .843). The first author coded the remaining data (except teacher-student talk and inaudible talk)
for a total of 5,504 turns of talk. We next calculated frequencies of students' coded discourse and divided each
student's total by the group's total for each code. We used these proportions to compare students' talk over time
and identify roles in groups. We also compared the two groups' talk using z-score tests of homogeneity.
         Finally, we compared student's pre- and post-unit scores from a researcher-designed content test. Due to
small group sizes, we compared relative percent gains within groups, rather than conducting statistical tests.

Findings
To understand roles, we analyzed how each group member contributed to group discourse, especially decision-
making and science talk. Group A contributed 2,407 turns of talk. Mala contributed the most to (40.0%), followed
by Sylvia (28.0%), Rose (27.3%), and Melinda (4.7%). Table 1 below shows each student's contributions to
decision-making and science talk over the four activities, with darker shading indicating higher contributions.
         Mala contributed the most to conceptual (70.7%) and task-based (55.1%) decision-making during three
of four activities. She also offered alternatives (36.2%) and controlled resources (38.7%) more than her group
members. Sylvia and Rose also contributed to decision-making, especially during Activity 3 (see Table 2). Sylvia
contributed the most to asking (41.0%), accepting (35.6%), and questioning (37.5%). Rose repeated decisions as
often as Mala (32.7%), but she also contributed the most to off-task talk (33.5%). Melinda contributed the least
to each kind of talk. Regarding students' science talk, Mala contributed the most to conceptual discussion (44.2%),
followed by Sylvia (26.1%), Rose (25.1%), and Melinda (4.7%). Mala also contributed the most to metacognitive
reflection (51.8%), followed by Rose (27.1%), Sylvia (20.0%), and Melinda (1.2%). Thus, Mala contributed the
most to conceptual and metacognitive talk in Group A.
         As Mala contributed the most to decision-making and science talk overall, we identified her as the
conceptual and task leader in Group A, with support from other members (see the excerpt below Table 1).
However, Sylvia and Rose made considerable contributions to the group's discourse, especially during Activity
3. Sylvia acted as the decision evaluator by asking for, questioning, and accepting others' suggestions, with some
support from Rose. In contrast, Melinda acted as a quiet learner in her group. Melinda contributed little to group
discourse, but we observed she used the simulation on her own to conduct additional experiments as Mala, Sylvia,
and Rose discussed earlier experiments. We also noted that students tended to focus their gaze on shared resources
(e.g., the computer) or each other during discussions, which we interpreted as active participation.

                              Mala:     Who is your group leader? All right, me.
                              Rose:     Mala.
                              Sylvia:   Group leader ­ do we even have one?
                              Rose:     Yeah, Mala.
                              Sylvia:   Wouldn't that be [the teacher]?
                              Rose:     No, it would be one of us.
                              Mala:     I'm the leader today.

         For comparison, Group B contributed 3,097 turns of talk. Christy contributed the most (34.3%), followed
by Josh (27.3%), Lydia (21.2%), and Luis (17.2%). Table 2 below shows each student's contributions to decision-
making and science talk over the four activities, with darker shading indicating higher contributions. Christy
contributed the most to conceptual (80.0%) and task-based (60.3%) decision-making during the four activities.
She also asked (50.0%), accepted (51.4%), repeated (43.8%), and offered more alternative (55.0%) decisions.
Josh questioned decisions (46.7%) and controlled resources (38.7%) more than other group members. Lydia and

Luis  contributed  less to  decision-making  than   Christy  or  Josh. Regarding   students' science   talk, Christy
contributed the most    to conceptual  discussion  (52.3%),  followed  by Josh   (28.1%), Lydia (10.1%),  and  Luis
(9.5%). Christy also contributed the most to metacognitive reflection (70.0%), followed by Lydia (20.0%), Josh
(10.0%), and Luis (0.0%). Thus, Christy contributed the most to conceptual and metacognitive talk in Group B.
         As Christy contributed the most to decision-making and science talk, we identified her as the conceptual
and task leader in Group B. Group B, however, seemed to accept her leadership differently than in Group A.
While other members of Group A actively supported and/or questioned Mala's ideas, the members of Group B
accepted Christy's role as leader by abdicating responsibility. Group B seemed content to let Christy "do all the
work" (see the excerpt below Table 2). Group B also demonstrated frequent off-task talk or activities, such as
braiding hair. Josh  provided   limited support for  Christy's  decision-making  by questioning  others'  decisions.
However, Lydia and Luis mostly acted as free-riders in the group (Strijbos & De Laat, 2010).

             Christy:       What the heck?
             Josh:          What the heck, nah nah. We haven't even got this done yet. We haven't
                            even got this done yet. We're all working while you're just talking so...
             Christy:       What the...?
             Luis:          And you're stressing out.
             Lydia:         Josh, she's doing all the work.

         Thus, one student in each group emerged as a conceptual and task leader. However, the dynamics in
which leadership emerged differed between groups. In Group A, Sylvia and Rose actively negotiated Mala's ideas.
However, in Group B, Christy was the primary decision-maker and contributed the most science talk. To illustrate
differences, we compared groups' talk using z-score tests of homogeneity. We found that Group A contributed
significantly more decision-making talk than Group B (37.6% vs. 12.1%, z = 22.2, p < .001). Also, Group A
contributed significantly more science talk than Group B (38.9% vs. 20.2%, z = 15.3, p < .001). However, Group
B contributed significantly more off-task talk than Group A (69.5% vs. 30.6%, z = 28.7, p < .001). Thus, Group
A seemed to demonstrate more productive collaboration than Group B.
         We also compared students' learning outcomes as assessed on a content test. We calculated percent gains
by subtracting pre-test scores from post-test scores. In Group A, all four students showed conceptual gains on the
post-test (ranging from 15.4% to 37.5%, with an average gain of 25.7%). Sylvia improved by 37.5% on her post-
test (41.9% to  79.4%).    Rose improved  by 25%     (50.0%  to 75.0%), as   did Melinda  (66.2% to    91.2%). Mala
improved by 15.4% (66.9% to 82.4%). Yet, in Group B, only two students showed conceptual gains on the post-
test (ranging from -2.9% to 25.0%, with an average gain of 7.2%). Josh improved by 25.0% on his post-test
(59.6% to 84.6%) and Lydia improved by 6.6% (58.1% to 64.7%). However, Luis had a 2.9% decrease on his
post-test (66.9% to 64.0%). Christy had scored 100% on her pre-test, and she again scored 100% on the post-test
(0.0%). Thus, Group B demonstrated lower conceptual gains on the post-test than Group A.

Discussion and conclusion
Our goal was to understand how roles emerged during CSCL activities in a 12-week science unit, and how these
roles may have shaped students' conceptual outcomes. From our analysis of group members' contributions to
decision-making and science talk over time, we found that one student in each group assumed a leadership role.
Mala (Group A) and Christy (Group B) contributed the majority of conceptual and task-based decision-making,
as well as conceptual discussion and metacognitive reflection. Thus, Mala and Christy acted as intellectual and
organizational leaders in their respective groups (Mercier et al., 2014). However, we observed differences in how
other group members accepted this leadership. Mala's group members seemed to accept her leadership while still
engaging in constructive critique of her ideas (Mercer & Dawes, 2008). However, Christy's group members
accepted her leadership because it meant they could contribute less. Consequently, Group A seemed to collaborate

CSCL 2019 Proceedings                                    674                                                  © ISLS
more effectively than Group B, as members of Group A engaged in more decision-making and science talk, and
significantly less off-task talk, than Group B.
        Although members of Group A did not contribute equally to conceptual discussions or metacognitive
reflection, they all showed conceptual gains on their post-tests. Even the quiet student, Melinda, appeared to
benefit from her group's conceptual and metacognitive talk, as shown by her higher post-test score (the second
highest score of students in both groups, with the exception of Christy). However, in Group B, only Josh and
Lydia showed conceptual gains on their post-tests. This is partially explained by Christy's maximum score on
both pre- and post-tests. However, Luis appeared to do worse on the post-test. Luis did not show the same benefit
as Melinda, likely explained by his tendency to engage in off-task talk.
        While acknowledging that our sample is too small to determine causality, our findings indicated that
distributed, active participation in CSCL  activities   (in discourse or attention) may be  more   important than
emergence of a leader in supporting collaboration and conceptual gains in each group. Each group included an
emergent leader (Mala, Christy), along with one student who contributed little to group decision-making (Melinda,
Luis). However, the less-verbal students showed marked differences in their participation and outcomes. Melinda
seemed to pay attention to her group's activities; conducted experiments as other students discussed concepts; and
demonstrated conceptual gains on her post-test. Luis, however, participated in off-task talk and activities, and
actually did worse on the post-test than pre-test. His lack of participation reflected a larger trend in Group B to
engage in "free-riding" (Strijbos & De Laat, 2010), as members of Group B seemed content to let Christy complete
their work. Correspondingly, Group B demonstrated overall lower conceptual gains compared to Group A.
        This study's implications relate to how the assumption of roles, as evidenced in group discourse, shapes
collaboration and learning within groups. Intellectual leaders can help groups to successfully complete tasks
(Mercier et al., 2014), but how leaders are accepted may also affect the group's conceptual outcomes. While a
student in   each group  assumed  leadership,   this leadership did not always promote  productive  collaboration
(Dillenbourg, 2002). Thus, some scripting of roles may support student's participation in shared meaning-making
(De Wever et al., 2010; Spada, 2010). However, since students do not always enact roles as intended (Hoadley,
2010), we must understand how groups establish roles and norms for collaboration over time (Mercer & Dawes,
2008; Sarmiento & Shumar, 2010) to inform the ways in which we integrate scaffolds for setting group norms
(Wang et al., 2017) and intervene at key points to redistribute roles and reshape collaboration.
