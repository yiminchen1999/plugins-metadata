       Abstract: This study investigates the effects of a digital guided peer feedback on students'
       learning and satisfaction. Participants were 203 students who were randomly assigned to groups
       of three. students were asked to explore various perspectives, and the 'pros and cons' on the
       topic of 'Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)'. The findings show that the digital module
       fosters students' learning and satisfaction.

Introduction
Digital learning modules are increasingly introduced in higher education, including in the life sciences (Noroozi
& Busstra et al., 2012). They provide students with various modes of information presentation, such as texts,
exercises, graphs, diagrams, animations, pictures etc., that can support students' learning. The use of such modules
can also be challenging especially in real educational settings in which motivational aspects for learning are
crucial. An approach to stimulate motivation for students to embrace such modules in their courses is to design
and develop modules with peer feedback possibility that provide them with pleasant opportunities for learning.
Despite the fact that scientific literature highlights the importance of feedback for learning (see Bayerlein et al.,
2014), there remains a challenge for students to construct good quality feedback in collaborative settings (see
Noroozi & Weinberger et al., 2012, 2013). As a result, the feedback may remain at the surface level and lack solid
arguments for promoting deep learning. Thus, additional feedback support is needed if students are to willingly
and with a high degree of motivation provide high-quality feedback in such modules. This study thus designs,
implements, and evaluates a digital learning module with an intensified peer feedback support. The goal is to
explore whether a digital module with guided peer feedback which encourages challenges and motivation support
students' domain specific knowledge gain. In addition, the extent to which the use of such a digital learning
module is appreciated by students is studied as well.

Methods
The study took place at Wageningen University in the Netherlands with 203 BSc students who were divided into
groups of three students. The topic for discussion was Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) with the focus
on the use of "cultured meat manufacturing ­ insect cells". A digital module was designed with a web-enabled
platform that provides students with various modes of information presentation, such as texts, exercises, graphs,
diagrams, and pictures with the feedback features The feedback features was designed in such a way as to guide
the interaction style for both synchronous and synchronous interactions ­ promoting reasoning, critical discussion,
and justified arguments ­ (see Figure 1). Overall, the session took about 4 hours and consisted of four main phases.

         A pre-test post-test questionnaire was used to measure students' domain-specific knowledge gain. This
questionnaire consisted of 17 multiple-choice questions. A questionnaire was used to assess students' motivation
and satisfaction with the learning experiences. This questionnaire consisted of four main sections and 36 items in
total on a five-point Likert scale ranging from "almost never true", "rarely true", "occasionally true", "often true"
through to "almost always true".

Findings
Repeated  measurement    for ANOVA     test    showed     that the domain-specific  knowledge     of students      improved
significantly from pre-test to post-test. This indicates the positive effects of the digital learning module on the
domain-specific knowledge gain of students. Students' motivation and satisfaction with the learning experiences
appeared to be sufficiently high (around four on a five-point Likert scale) for all students.

Conclusions and implications
This study used a digital learning module that also supported peer feedback process to engage students in an
intensified processes of learning and writing about a controversial topic. The module was designed in such a way
as to provoke students for exchanging and directing diverse and multiple conflicting opinions towards deeper
reasoning. The use of peer feedback support guided the students in appropriate ways to analyse learning partners
arguments about the topic, express agreements/disagreements and when possible integrate various points of views
in their own reflection report. This digital learning module provided a safe and respectful learning environment
for students to also practice their argumentation and exercise critical discussion and reasoning skills without
recourse to, or fear of, personal statements, enhancing their awareness of the topic. Exchanging diverse and
multiple conflicting  opinions,  analysing     one    another  arguments,  and  expressing agreements/disagreements
supported with scientific facts, arguments, logical evidence and examples were then reflected in the attitudinal
change of students towards the controversial topic of the GMOs from pre-test to post-test.
