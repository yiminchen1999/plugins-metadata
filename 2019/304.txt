        Abstract: Embodied learning activities supported by motion-based technologies are becoming
        popular   in various   contexts and  settings.  However,  little  is yet known    about technology
        integration for embodied learning in groups in authentic classroom settings, as existing studies
        have been mostly conducted in laboratory settings. In this work, we examine students' learning
        and perceptions of technology integration for group learning in a high-embodied, Kinect-based
        educational game (Condition1, n=24 students), in comparison with a low-embodied, desktop-
        based version of the same game (Condition2, n=18 students), in an authentic classroom setting.
        Data    collection included questionnaires     evaluating students'    baseline, knowledge    gains,
        perceptions of technology integration, and post-activity interviews. Findings showed higher
        learning gains and more positive perceptions of technology integration, in terms of opportunities
        for student  negotiation,  for  the students   in the  low-embodied    condition. Implications  are
        discussed   for supporting  high-embodied    learning  activities  for group  learning  in authentic
        classroom settings.

Introduction and theoretical background
Embodied learning, as an application of the embodied cognition theory, constitutes a contemporary pedagogy of
learning, which emphasizes the use of the body in the educational practice (Antle, 2013, 2009; Barsalou, 2010;
Georgiou & Ioannou, in press). Embodied learning environments based on motion-based technologies appear to
have gained ground during the last decade, providing new ways in which the embodied cognition theory can be
enacted in the field of education (Kosmas, Ioannou, Retalis, 2018, 2017). In particular, the widespread population
of affordable motion-based technologies and natural user interfaces (e.g., Wii, Xbox Kinect, Leap Motion) have
nowadays opened the doors for the design of technology-enhanced embodied learning environments, responding
to the need to highlight the aspects of motion and physicality as a crucial part of the learning process (Melcer &
Isbister, 2016). As argued by Maliverni and Pares (2014), technology-enhanced embodied learning environments
open up new possibilities due to their potential affordances for promoting psychomotor, cognitive and affective
learning gains.
        From    a technology   integration perspective,   incorporating innovative  motion-based    technologies and
natural user interfaces in the school classroom introduces new challenges to teaching and learning; therefore, their
incorporation in mainstream education is at a very slow pace (Abrahamson & Sánchez-García, 2016). According
to Karakostas, Palaigeorgiou, and Kompatsiaris (2017) existing research on embodied learning technologies has
been fragmented and is driven largely by technological innovations. Also, it has taken place mostly in laboratory
settings focusing on the participants' interactions with the embodied environments, therefore lacking a clear focus
on investigating their efficacy in authentic educational contexts (Karakostas et al., 2017). Moreover, while a
number of technology-enhanced embodied learning environments have received positive evaluation in high-
controlled laboratory settings (e.g., Homer et al., 2014; Lindgren, Tscholl, Wang, & Johnson, 2016), the limited
number of studies conducted in authentic school classrooms had not be as successful as initially expected in
promoting students' learning gains, compared to low-embodied, desktop-based environments (e.g., Anderson &
Wall, 2016; Hung, Lin, Fang & Chen, 2014). The later warrants further investigation towards shedding light on
the efficacy of high-embodied vs. low-embodied learning environments in authentic classroom settings.
        The  study   adopts  Moos   (1987)'s   conceptual   framework     of technology   integration grounding  the
experience in three dimensions: "Relationship", "Personal development" and "System maintenance and change".
Moos (1987)'s framework was used by Wu, Chang, and Guo (2007) and Maor and Fraser (2005) to derive
subscales for the measurement and evaluation of the experience of technology integration. In particular, in this
work, we examine     students' perceptions  of technology     integration aimed  at a high-embodied,   Kinect-based
learning experience (Condition1, n=24 students), in comparison with a low-embodied, desktop-based learning

experience (Condition2, n=18 students) for leaning in groups in an authentic classroom setting. The study sought
to answer the following research questions: (i) Are there differences in student's learning gains and attitudes
between the conditions? (ii) What are the main factors affecting students perceptions of technology integration
in the two conditions?

Methodology
Participants
Participants were 42 students in 4th grade (aged 8-9 years old), who were enrolled in a public primary school in
the Eastern Mediterranean. The students were randomly assigned to the two conditions. Group1 (Kinect-based
gaming condition) had 24 children (12 boys, 50%) and Group2 (Desktop-based gaming condition) had 18 children
(11 boys, 61%).

Research design
This study followed an explanatory sequential design, composed of two sequential phases (Creswell, Clark &
Vicci, 2011). In phase 1, we adopted a two-group quasi-experimental design for investigating students' learning
gains and perceptions of technology integration in both conditions. In phase 2, we proceeded with qualitative data
collection to deepen our understanding of the factors relating to students' perceptions of technology integration.

The digital game
We employed the "Alien Health" digital game, which was designed to teach 4th-12th grades about nutrition and
healthy food choices. The game is well-related to the school curriculum whilst findings from previous studies of
"Alien Health" indicated its acceptability by the children and its affordances to improve content knowledge
(Johnson-Glenberg & Hekler, 2013). Children's mission in the game is to make the right nutritional choices for
the alien to make him feel better as he in charge of stopping the collision of an asteroid with the Earth. During the
gameplay, children are presented with combinations of food and are requested to make choices within predefined
timeframes,   considering  a constellation  of five  nutrients per food (protein,  fats, carbohydrates, fiber, and
vitamins/minerals). The digital game became available in both a low-embodied (desktop-based) and in a high-
embodied (Kinect-based) version.

The interventions
Considering   the research   goals of this study, an 80-minute   intervention was  developed  for each  condition.
Children in the low-embodied (desktop) condition were divided in dyads and used the desktop-based version of
the digital game. In this version children used the mouse and the keyboard for making a choice and feeding the
alien (see Figure 1). Children in the high-embodied (Kinect-based) condition were divided in groups of four (the
limited classroom space allowed only six Kinect work-stations of the game) and used the Kinect-based version of
the game. In this case, the game was projected on a big screen and there was touchless interaction via the Kinect
camera which can identify children's arm/hand movement hovering over a single food item and moving it into
the Alien's mouth (see Figure 2). In both conditions the game was contextualized in a collaborative educational
activity. In particular, the children took  turns in playing   (game affords  only single player mode);  the other
child(ren) of the group was/were asked to provide feedback to the player, discuss the selections made, and record
their food choices on a structured worksheet.

Data collection and analysis
Data collection included questionnaires evaluating students' baseline, knowledge gains, perceptions of technology
integration, and post-activity interviews with eight students from Condition1 (33.3%) and eight students from
Condition2 (44.4%).

Baseline data
We aimed at establishing the equivalency of the two conditions in terms of computer and gaming attitudes. We
used the Computer Attitude Measure for Young Students questionnaire (CAMYS, Teo & Noyes, 2008), which is
composed of 12 items on a five-point Likert scale and has a documented reliability alpha coefficient of .85.
Gaming attitudes were measured using an 11-item Likert scale (Cronbach's alpha=0.73) validated in the study of
Bressler and Bodzin (2013). Differences between the two conditions were examined using the Mann-Whitney U
test, given the small sample size of participants in each condition and the lack of normal distribution in the data.

Knowledge test
A knowledge test was administered in pre-post format. The test was developed by Johnson-Glenberg and Hekler
(2013) for evaluating students' learning gains in the Alien Health game.

Technology integration survey
Students' perceptions of the technology integration were evaluated at the end of the experience. The questionnaire
was composed of five subscales guided by Moos (1987)'s conceptual framework of technology integration, later
used by Wu, Chang and Guo (2007) and Maor and Fraser (2005) to derive subscales for its three dimensions:
"Relationship", "Personal development" and "System maintenance and change" as in Table 1.

Post-activity interviews
Eight students   from  each   condition participated in an   approximately  15-minute  semi-structured individual
interview, which took place right after the intervention. The students were asked to talk about their learning
experience with Alien Health, as well as their use and perceptions of the utilized technology. Driven by Moos
(1987)'s conceptual framework of technology integration and its three dimensions, the students were particularly
probed to discuss the factors affecting their experience in terms of: (a) Personal development (e.g., What were the
main factors that help you learn during your participation in this digital game?), (b) Relationships with others
(e.g., How was the collaboration among team members structured around the digital game employed?), and (c)
Technology use (e.g., Did you encounter any problems while using the digital game? How those problems affected
you?). All interviews were transcribed and coded within the three dimensions of our conceptual framework.

Findings
Setting the baseline
A Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify any potential differences between groups in student' attitudes
towards computers and digital games (Table 2). Results showed that there were no statistical differences in the
student's gaming    attitudes (U(40)=198.5, z=-.45,  p>.05)  and attitudes towards computers   (U(40)=183, z=-.84,
p>.05) between the groups.

Knowledge gains
A Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify any potential differences between groups in student' pre- and post-
test scores (Table 3). Results showed that there were no statistical differences in the student's pre-test scores
(U(40)=212, z=-.11, p>.05). However, focusing on the post-test scores, students in Condition 2, who employed the
desktop-based game, outperformed their counterparts in Condition 1, who employed the kinect-based game, and
this difference was statistically significant (U(40)=139.5, z=-1.96, p..05) between the groups.

Perceptions of technology integration
A Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify any potential differences in student's perceptions of technology
integration across conditions. The results showed that students in Condition 2 had better perceptions of technology
integration regarding "Student Negotiation" subscale. Yet, there were no statistical differences between the groups
on all other subscales (see Table 4).

Factors contributing to students' perceptions of technology integration
The thematic analysis led to the identification of numerus factors (codes) influencing students' attitudes, namely
perceptions of technology integration, within the three dimensions of our conceptual framework: "Relationship",
"Personal development" and "System maintenance and change". A conceptual map was the result of further
organizing the emerging factors into basic themes: (a) Content-related factors, referring to the features of the
gaming content, (b) Interface-related factors, referring to the affordances of the gaming platform, (c) Activity-
related factors related to the pedagogical setting in which the game was contextualized and (d) Context related
factors, referring to the characteristics of the physical environment in which the activity was enacted. All factors
were evaluated as positive or negative in relation to their impact on students' perceptions (see Table 5).

                                         interaction

Personal development
Students in both conditions reported how a set of content-related factors such as the learning nature of the game,
the gaming features (e.g. stages, points, rewards), the narrative plot on which the game was structured, as well as
the integrated scaffolding (e.g.,  hints and prompts)     had  a positive   contribution to    their personal learning
development. E.g.
        "I liked the game's narrative plot as there was an alien trying to go back to his planet. We had
        to feed the alien with healthy foods. I liked the fact that every new planet was a new stage in the
        game with a new activity to do. It was an educational game because you could learn about
        nutrients in food." [#Girl -L-, Desktop-based version]
However, students in the high-embodied cognition highlighted that there was too much textual information, while
students who worked in the lowly-embodied condition also added that there was a repetition of the gaming stages,
which in turn had a negative impact of their interest. E.g.

CSCL 2019 Proceedings                                     308                                                    © ISLS
        "A negative factor in the game that I can think of was the large text. A box popped up in every
       new stage writing a lot of text. Text could be limited." [#Girl -E-, Kinect-based version]
Focusing on the activity-related factors, students in both conditions, added that while the worksheets that they
were required to complete contributed positively to their personal development, the gaming nature sometimes
inhibited the learning process, as in many cases the students would deal with the activity as a playful rather than
as an educational experience. E.g.
       "We were carried away when playing the game and were oftentimes forgetting to complete our
       paper assignment. It was difficult to remember later on what to write." [#Girl -L-, Desktop-
       based version]
Focusing on the interface-related factors, students in the high-embodied condition reported that while the activity
allowed for embodied interactions which were valuable for their learning and personal development, locomotion
was in some cases a negative aspect. In particular, as some of students admitted, in some cases they would be
more focused on coordinating their body movements, rather than on the learning content. E.g.
       "Moving my body did not help me being concentrated but I had a lot of fun. If I was stable in
       front of a computer I would have been more concentrate because I would focus on the screen
       and click the correct answer, rather than trying to coordinate my body." [#Girl -E-, Kinect-
       based version]
Finally, students in both conditions reported how the classroom noise and other groups' interventions while
working, were two main context-related factors negatively affecting their personal development.

Relationship
Students' in both conditions reported how a set of activity-related factors such as the team-based mode in which
the activity was enacted, the collaborative writing task that were assigned (one worksheet to be completed by
each group) and the peer feedback strategies that were followed, had a positive impact on their collaboration.
More specifically, as the students mentioned all these factors promoted productive social interactions, such as
exchange of views and ideas, peer scaffolding and assistance. E.g.
       "I liked working in my group to complete the paper assignment. We worked collaboratively and
       we were helping each other. We were helping our co-players to choose the correct answer, we
       were giving instructions and we were encouraging each other to try harder." [#Girl -E-, Kinect-
       based version]
However, students in the high-embodied condition also negatively elaborated on how a set of activity-related
factors, such as working in large groups (of 4 students) in combination to the unstructured collaboration, affected
their relationships negatively. In particular, as the students admitted, both of these factors prohibited their effective
collaboration, as it was more difficult to agree on a common strategy and plan their next steps, while there were
also many disagreements with children often fighting over turn-taking and roles in the group. E.g.
       "I wanted to play more but the other members in my team urged me to finish so they could play.
       There was also a boy taking my turn in the game. He wanted to play instead of me. I couldn't
       concentrate because my team members were telling me the correct answers, or they were trying
       to show me how to move. I got confused!" [#Boy -M-, Kinect-based version]
Finally, students in both conditions, highlighted that in terms of the interface-related factors, the single-
player mode of the game, transformed the non-player(s) as spectators, and this had also a negative effect
on students' relationships. Importantly in the high-embodied    condition, this factor had an  increased
negative effect given the increased waiting time between turns, which resulted in off-task discussions and
behaviors amongst the members of the group. E.g.
       "The game was for a single player. All the other members of the group stayed aside, they had
       conversations with each other about topics unrelated to the game's content and they were not
       concentrated   in    their team  members'  actions    neither on  contributing   to the  group's
       collaboration." [#Girl -A-, Kinect-based version]

System maintenance and change
According to the students of the high-embodied condition, the large projection (bigger screen providing more
heightened sensory stimuli), the interface (with the use of novel technologies), as well as the affordances of the

CSCL 2019 Proceedings                                   309                                                    © ISLS
gaming    platform for   promoting  bodily   movement    (via  the gesture-based     interactions), contributed  to their
experienced immersion and this had a positive impact on their perceptions of technology use. E.g.
          "There was a large screen which seemed nicer and easier. I could see everything in that big
          screen. I could have better control of the game and I could feel like being in the game!" [#Boy -
          I-, Kinect-based version]
However, the students of the high-embodied condition reported that the controls of the game which were rather
different from   traditional gaming    controls, some   synchronization     issues   often presented  between   students'
movements and their belated projection on the screen, as well as some technical bugs (provoked by students'
proximity to the Kinect), affected their perceptions of technology in a negative way. E.g.
          "Sometimes there were problems with the technology. The game blocked and our hand signal
          was not appearing on the screen or was presented in a wrong position. This cost us time as we
          had to wait for the problem to be resolved!" [#Boy -I-, Kinect-based version]
Finally, students in the low-embodied cognition reported that the small projection (limited desktop screen) and
the low graphics interface had a negative effect on their perceptions about the technology use. However, students
in the low-embodied condition explained that the game had familiar gaming controls (keyboard and mouse) and
thus, was more easily integrated in the lesson.

Discussion and implications
The present  investigation    examined    students' learning  and  perceptions    of  technology  integration  for  group
learning in a high-embodied, Kinect-based educational game, in comparison with a low-embodied, desktop-based
version of the same game, in an authentic classroom setting. Findings suggest higher learning gains and more
positive perceptions of technology integration, in terms of opportunities for student negotiation, for the students
in the low-embodied condition.
          Are there differences in student's leaning outcomes and attitudes between the conditions? In the present
work, there was    no   difference in most   dimensions   of  students'   attitudes, namely,  perception  of technology
integration, across conditions. Yet, the opportunity for "student negotiation" was deemed higher in the low-
embodied   condition.   Also, students   in the  low-embodied     condition  presented   increased  knowledge   gains  in
comparison to their counterparts in the high-embodied condition. In general, the results contradict findings of
prior research conducted in laboratory settings in which the prevalence of high-embodied, over low-embodied
games, in students learning is presented (Homer et al., 2014; Lindgren et al., 2016). Indeed, the present study
supports previous evidence (from a limited number of studies conducted in authentic school classrooms) that the
high-embodied    experience   has  not  been  as successful   as  initially expected  in   promoting  students' learning
compared to low-embodied, desktop-based environments (e.g., Anderson & Wall, 2016; Hung, Lin, Fang & Chen,
2014). That is, while being enjoyable and engaging, the experience with embodied learning technologies used in
a typical classroom environment to run learning tasks may not always produce significant learning gains.
          What   are the   main   factors affecting    students' perceptions   of   technology  integration  in the  two
conditions? The analysis of students' post-activity interviews shed light to our findings; a series of contextual
factors were mentioned by students to have affected their perceived experience in a negative way. For example,
common    technical  issues  or a  noisy  classroom    environment,    may  detract  from, rather than enhance   student
learning, which   is not  a  surprising  result (e.g., Darling-Aduana     &  Heinrich,   2018). The   study  presented a
conceptual map to summarize these factors into content-related factors, interface-related factors, activity-related
factors and context related factors affecting the experience, positively or negatively, in both conditions. The map
can be informative in future research and practice in the area allowing to control for some for these factors in the
authentic learning environment.
          Evaluating the outcomes of the present case study, several limitations should be noted. Conducting
scientific research in a functioning classroom environment was challenging which naturally introduced flaws in
the implementation of the study. For example, the overall time for the activity was fixed by the school time-table
which did not allow much time for familiarization with the game mechanisms, especially in the high-embodied
(Kinect-based) condition. The classroom's setting imposed several additional constraints; having a number of
students in groups interacting with Kinect cameras created undesirable noise and interference. There is clearly
much more work that could be done to explore the best ways of integrating embodied learning technologies within
a classroom setting. Given the popularity of embodied leaning technologies in the recent days, this work helps to
identify  issues which   warrant  future  investigation in the   field of emerging    technology  integration. A   central
question  remains    to be  answered:   under   what   circumstances   can   embodied    technologies  be educationally
beneficial in authentic classroom settings? Future research may wish to focus on specific strategies for embodied

learning technology integration, designed to be immediately adopted by in-service teachers. Such work could be
beneficial in increasing integration of emerging technology promising to enable students' learning gains and
positive perceptions of embodied technology use for learning in groups.
