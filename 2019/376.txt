         Abstract:   This paper examines    whether  and  to what extent    long  and short  readers  make
         different contributions to collaborative design discussions in a CSCL environment--that is,
         we investigate whether a simple measure of reading behavior based on clickstream data is a
         good   proxy for  engagement    with  readings. Our  approach    to addressing    this question  is
         multimodal, involving two sources of data: (a) a record of students' online conversations, and
         (b) the frequency and duration with which documents were open on each student's screen.
         This study suggests that in this specific case, relatively thin data about reading frequency and
         mean reading duration can be used to make inferences about students' reading behavior in a
         CSCL   context   where it is impossible  to observe   directly. It  also shows    the  power of  a
         multimodal approach to the data--here, we are using one mode of data (discussion) to get a
         better understanding of another mode (clickstream).

Introduction
In computer-supported   collaborative learning   (CSCL)  environments,    people  learn complex    thinking  through
interactions with people and tools (Hutchins, 1995). However, there are important actions and interactions that
cannot be observed. One particularly difficult activity to investigate in CSCL contexts is reading. Prior research
on text comprehension (Bell, 2001) suggests that there is a correlation between the amount of time that a student
reads and the extent to which they understand the text. However, these studies are based on observations of the
time students spend actually attending to a document. While it is possible to use eye-tracking systems to model
what parts of a text a student focuses on in a CSCL context, this requires equipment that is difficult to deploy at
scale (Rayner, Chace, Slattery, & Ashby, 2006). An alternative approach is to infer from clicking and scrolling
behavior how a student engages with a text.
         But how much data about student reading is needed to understand what role text resources play in a
CSCL environment? The answer to that question clearly depends on the specifics of the CSCL environment:
what is being learned, by whom, and through what activities, and what role the information from texts plays in
the process. In this paper, we argue that it may be possible to infer students' level of engagement with a text
using only a small amount of information: the frequency with which students open documents, and the length of
time that the documents remain open on the screen. Most CSCL environments already record these as part of
their clickstream data--the data collected by the CSCL system as students work. Using one CSCL environment,
we show that this relatively sparse data is a reasonable proxy for students' depth of engagement with texts.
         Specifically, we investigate student learning in the context of a virtual internship in which students
read engineering resources and collaborate with other students through an online chat interface to design an
assistive mechanical device. Most of the information that is the basis for collaborative discussions and design
experimentation  is  conveyed  by  technical  documents  and  research   reports. In other  words,  reading  plays a
central role in this context. There   is thus an important   interaction between   students'   engagement    with the
readings and their collaborative discussions, both of which influence how they make design decisions.
         Our approach to addressing this question is multimodal. We used clickstream data to identify (a) long
readers (low frequency, high duration) and (b) short readers (high frequency, low duration). We then used chat
data to examine whether and to what extent long and short readers made different contributions to collaborative
discussions--that is, we investigated whether a simple measure of reading behavior based on clickstream data
could be used to make inferences about students' depth of engagement with the texts in this CSCL setting.
         To accomplish this, we used epistemic network analysis (ENA; Shaffer, Collier, and Ruis, 2016) to
analyze students' discourse in the domain based on their contributions to collaborative discussions. We then
used the resulting   ENA  model   to investigate the differences in discourse     patterns between   long and  short
readers. Our results show meaningful differences in discourse between long and short readers, suggesting that a
thick stream of data (such as chats) and be used to interpret the meaning of a thinner stream of data (such as

information on when documents are opened and closed). That is, in addition to using multiple data sources to
get  a better  understanding     of  student  learning,  we  used    one  mode    of  data (discussion   data)   to get a better
understanding of another mode (clickstream data).

Theory
A broad    range  of  work    in CSCL    has  shown   that   analyses  of   learning  should   not  focus  on a   (hypothetical)
unassisted individual, but rather need to consider individuals collaborating with others and using artifacts to
solve  complex    problems     (Hutchins,   1995;   Lave,   1988;  Shaffer,    2017).   One   particularly  important   tool for
learning   is  written  texts,  which   are   a prominent    feature   of many    learning    environments,    both   computer-
supported and face-to-face (Snow, 2002). However, investigating reading engagement in a CSCL context is
difficult because we cannot observe students directly (Siemens, 2013). Some researchers attempt to use eye-
tracking   to  model    engagement     with  texts, but  such    studies  are  difficult at   scale  and require    considerable
expertise to analyze the data (Rayner et al., 2006).
           Clickstream data, which most CSCL environments record, could also provide evidence of engagement
with items on screen. For example, Coiro (2003) argues that reading duration--the amount of uninterrupted
time on which a text appears on screen--can be used as a proxy measure for engagement with a text. However,
the  relationship    between   reading   time   and  reading    comprehension      is  complex.     On one   hand,  researchers
generally agree that more time spent reading leads to improvement in reading comprehension (McKeown, Beck,
&   Blake,    2009). On  the   other   hand,  the exact  nature   of  the relationship     is still debated  (Bell,  2001).  For
example, Coiro (2003) argues that there are two basic reading behaviors: (a) skimming, or "getting only the gist
of text in a short time," and (b) studying, or "reading texts with the intent of retaining the information for a
period of time."
           Studying behavior, however, is reflected not only in the total duration of time that a student engages
with   a reading,  but   also  in whether    they   engage   for sufficient   time   in one   reading  session   to process  the
information. This is distinct from a student who might spend the same total amount time on reading but do so in
a series   of small  and    separate chunks,    which is    more indicative   of  skimming     behavior.  If we   only  consider
reading duration as a metric of reading engagement, it would be difficult to distinguish between someone who
opens    a document     once  and   spends  a period  time   attempting   to   understand   the contents,    and someone     who
opens a reading multiple times, but spends only a short amount of time in each case. Similarly, it is difficult to
distinguish students who spend a long time reading because they are engaging deeply with the content and those
who spend a long time reading because they are struggling to understand it. Long reading duration, especially
combined with repeated reading of the same text, can indicate students who are struggling to retain information
in sufficiently large amounts to enable full comprehension (Bell, 2001; Rasinski, 2000). Thus, we need to take
into account    both    the frequency    and  duration  of   reading   to distinguish    skimming     behavior   from   studying
behavior in a CSCL context.
           Of  course,   we   are   ultimately  interested   in  the extent    to which    reading    behaviors   contribute    to
understanding     more      generally.  Research    (Snow,      2002)  shows      that   students    who   have   low    reading
comprehension     develop    only   very shallow    knowledge,    such   as scattered   facts  and  simple   definitions  of key
terms. Shallow understanding is not sufficient to solve complex problems or apply knowledge to new situations.
This suggests that different reading comprehension levels may relate to different levels of understanding, and
thus different ways of framing, investigating, and solving complex problems. To model distributed cognition in
the context of reading, then, we need to model how students apply knowledge from what they have read to their
collaborations with others in order to solve complex problems.
           To understand this complex relationship between reading and collaborative problem solving, we chose
to analyze data from a group of students solving an engineering design problem in a CSCL simulation that
positioned    them   as interns  at  an engineering   firm.  That  is, we   examined     the  interplay  between    reading  and
collaborative discussion in the context of an authentic learning task (Shaffer, 2006).
           Shaffer   (2012)  argues    that application  of  knowledge      to a  real-world   problem    in  the   context  of a
community of practice like engineering involves the development (and deployment) of an epistemic frame: a
pattern    of connections   among    knowledge,     skills, and  other cognitive     elements   that characterize   a discourse
community.     Here  we     model   how  students   have understood    what    the read    by  seeing  whether   and  how    they
integrate the readings into the knowledge, skills, and other elements of practice in the domain (Collier, Ruis, &
Shaffer, 2016).
           These relationships can be modeled with ENA, a technique for identifying and quantifying connections
among epistemic frame elements and representing them in dynamic network models. Critically, ENA accounts
for both connections made within an individual's own discourse and connections made to the discourse of other
individuals in a collaborative discussion. That is, ENA models how an individual contributes to collaborative

discourse. In this study, we explore whether long readers have different epistemic frames than short readers by
comparing their ENA networks, which indicate the contributions each student made to collaborative problem-
solving activities. Specifically, we ask:

    RQ1:    Do long readers and short readers show different patterns of interaction in collaborative discussions?
    RQ2:    Do these   differences (if any) reflect a difference  in the depth to which     long and  short  readers are
            engaging in the text?

Methods

Research context
We analyzed data from a virtual internship, RescuShell, in which students play the role of an intern at a fictional
engineering design firm. In RescuShell, students design the robotic legs for a mechanical exoskeleton to be used
by rescue workers. They use an online work portal with text resources, simulated design tools, and a built-in
chat interface to collaborate with their project teams. The virtual internship simulates the engineering design
process, including reviewing and summarizing research reports, creating device prototypes, discussing design
choices with teammates, and working to balance the needs of various stakeholders (Chesler et al., 2015).
         In RescuShell,   the primary   source  of  information   about  the technical constraints    and  performance
parameters is a set of reading materials, including technical reports and research briefs. These documents, which
consist of detailed text descriptions as well as tables, graphs, and images, help students gain sufficient technical
knowledge to design and evaluate the performance of a mechanical exoskeleton. Importantly, key information is
not concentrated    in one place,  but  is  diffused  across  the documents.   That   is,   students need   to  integrate
information from various documents and then discuss design decisions with their teammates, providing insight
into how and to what extent the readings inform their design reasoning.
         In this study, we analyzed group discussions (12,859 lines of chat data) and individual clickstreams
(24,034 lines of clickstream data) from 203 college students who used RescuShell at eight different sites in the
United States between 2013 and 2015.

Data analysis

Identifying long and short readers
We  extracted  students'  clickstream   data, which   consist of  a  time-stamped   record   of  clicks in  the system,
including  accessing   resources,  sending  emails  and  messages,   saving  notes, and   so on.  We    then   calculated
(a) how often each student opened one of the 17 different documents (frequency), and (b) the length of time
each document was open on screen before the student clicked on anything outside the document (duration).
         The  documents    in RescuShell    contain  an average   of 463  words,  with    a range 153   to  786  words.
Although reading speed varies based on a number of factors, college students typically read around 450 words
per minute (Carver, 1992). In this study, the median frequency was 104 clicks (i.e., accessing the readings 104
times over the course of the virtual internship), and the median duration was 48 seconds. We used these values
to divide students into long (lower frequency, higher duration than the medians) and short (higher frequency,
lower duration than the medians) reading groups. Students with both frequencies and mean durations lower than
the medians were omitted from the analysis, as this indicates little meaningful engagement with the readings.
Students with frequencies and mean durations higher than the medians were also omitted, as this could indicate
students who were struggling to understand the content.

Discourse coding
Chat   transcripts were segmented   by  utterance,  defined  as when   a student  sent a  single  message    in the chat
program. To code the chat data for key epistemic frame elements relevant to the simulated engineering design
process, we used an automated coding process (ncodeR; Marquart, Swiecki, Eagan, & Shaffer, 2018) based on
regular expression   matching.  We  validated  all  six codes using  a  series of comparisons     between   two  human
raters and  ncodeR;    pairwise Cohen's   kappa scores   ranged   between   0.83  and  1.00  (see Table    1).  We  used
Shaffer's rho to determine, for each kappa value, the likelihood that it would be found by two coders if their true
rate of agreement was kappa < 0.65 (Shaffer, 2017). As shown in Table 2, all of the kappa values have rho
values less than 0.05, meaning that if the coders were to code the whole dataset, they would have a level of
agreement of kappa > 0.65 with a Type I error rate of less than 5%.

ENA Discourse Model
To  construct the ENA   model,    we   defined  the  units of analysis as all lines   of data associated with a  single
student. The ENA algorithm uses a moving window to construct a network model for each line in the data,
showing how codes in the current line are connected to codes that occur within the recent temporal context
(Siebert-Evenstone et al., 2017). Based on a grounded analysis of the data, we used a window of 7 lines (each
line plus the 6 previous lines) within each team activity. The resulting networks are aggregated for all lines for
each unit of analysis in the model. Networks were normalized to account for the fact that some students spoke
more   than others. We  used    a dimensional   reduction  that placed the  means     of the groups of long  and  short
readers  as close as   possible   to the x-axis   of the projected space, and  the    y-axis  was defined  by the    first
dimension of a singular value decomposition (Shaffer, Collier, & Ruis, 2016).
         ENA networks were visualized using network graphs where the nodes correspond to the codes, and the
edges reflect the relative frequency of co-occurrence, or connection, between two codes. ENA produces two
coordinated representations for each unit of analysis: (1) a plotted point, which represents the location of that
unit's network in the projected space, and (2) a weighted network graph. The positions of the network graph
nodes are fixed, and determined by an optimization routine that minimizes the difference between the plotted
points  and their corresponding      network  centroids.   Because  of this co-registration   of  network  graphs    and
projected space   (co-registration   correlations (Spearman)   were dimension   1  =   0.93, dimension   2 = 0.96),  the
positions of the network graph nodes--and the connections they define--can be used to interpret the dimensions
of the projected space and explain the positions of plotted points in the space. To test for differences between
the networks  of  long  and short    readers, we   applied  a two-sample  t-test, assuming    unequal  variance to   the
location of points  in the projected   ENA    space,  then used the corresponding      network graphs  to  interpret the
statistically significant differences.

Results

Quantitative results
Figure 1 shows each student's network location, along with the means and 95% confidence intervals of the long
readers (blue) and the short readers (red). There is a statistically significant difference between long and short
readers on the first dimension with a moderate effect size (meanlong = 0.02, meanshort = -0.18; t = 3.28, p < 0.01,
Cohen's d = 0.57).

            squares are group means; the dashed boxes are 95% confidence intervals (t-distribution).

         To examine    which  connections  accounted  for  the differences between    long and  short readers,  we
constructed mean epistemic networks for each group. As Figure 2 shows, both long readers (blue network, right)
and short readers (red network, left) made dense networks of connections. This suggests that students in both
groups were engaging in important engineering design practices. However, when we subtract one network from
the other (Figure 2, middle) to identify why there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups,
the long  readers (blue network,   right) made more   links between    DATA  and  other   elements of  the design
reasoning process   in  their discussions,  while   short  readers (left)  made  more    links  FROM   TECHNICAL
CONSTRAINTS to the other elements of the design reasoning process.
         Note that the two groups were not having independent discussions: 58% of the discussions involved
both long and short readers, and these results did not differ between mixed and homogenous groups.

            Short readers (left, red) mainly connected TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS with other elements;
             long readers (right, blue) primarily connected DATA with design reasoning elements.

Qualitative results
To  understand the importance   of these  differences between    long  and short readers,  we  analyzed students'
discussions qualitatively. Here, we present an example of a student discussion in RescuShell. This discussion
took place at an early stage in the design process, when students meet to decide on a power source and control
sensors for an experimental prototype. Just before the meeting, students read 6 technical documents, which are
their only source of information about the different power sources and control sensors. For example, the Safety
Standard Handbook provides data about the probability of failure modes occurring for different batteries and
control sensors.  The documents  include   detailed descriptions of how    different sensors function, as  well as
numeric data about the effects of the sensors on payload, agility, battery recharge interval, cost, and safety. The
Control Sensor Overview contains the table shown below (Table 2), which indicates how much each sensor
costs and how each sensor affects device safety. (In this case, the higher the risk priority number, the less safe
the device will be.) However, no single document contains complete information about the effects of different
power sources and control sensors on exoskeleton performance. Thus, integrating information from multiple
documents is the only way for students to understand the tradeoffs associated with different design choices.

         After reading these documents, students meet with their project teams to discuss which control sensor
they should choose for their design. Table 3 provides an excerpt from one project team's conversation about
which control sensor to choose. In the conversation are Sam and Mike, both identified as short readers based on
their clickstream data, and Joe, identified as a long reader.

         Line    1: Sam's   Question:  In line 1,  Sam  asks  his teammates:  "what   attributes for the  sensor does
everyone think is most important?" Thus, he suggests that identifying PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS will help the
team decide which sensor to choose.
         Line 2: Joe's Proposal: Joe, a long reader, begins line 2 by declaring his preference: "I would still go
with the Piezoelectric sensor" (TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS). However, he does not just state his preference, he
goes on to justify his claim (that is, use DESIGN REASONING). First, he acknowledges, the sensor he chose has a
downside    ("it is the most  expensive";   PERFORMANCE     PARAMETERS)    but   he also addresses   this concern  by
arguing that it is only the most expensive "by $11" (DATA). Finally, he explains that his choice has two highly
desirable attributes: "the highest recharge interval, second highest agility." Thus, he is proposing and justifying
his design choice by weighing the pros and cons of his proposal (DESIGN REASONING).
         In doing this, Joe is integrating information from multiple sources. The comparative cost information
among   control   sensors   comes  from   the data table in   the Control  Sensor   Overview (shown    above).   This
document    explains    the  relationship  between    piezoelectric  sensors  and   two   important   PERFORMANCE
PARAMETERS: recharge interval and agility. However, the ranking of the recharge interval and agility among
three control sensors--which is the basis of Joe's justification--can only be found in graphs from a different
document: the Control Sensor and Power Source Experimental Report, which describes the results obtained
from experiments to evaluate the recharge interval and agility of three different control sensors. In order to make
justify his choice   in terms  of  both performance    parameters   and cost, in  other  words,  Joe used   pieces of
information from different documents and synthesized them into a coherent argument.
         Line 3: Mike's response: In line 3, Mike, one of the short readers, also references the data table from
the Control Sensor Overview ("looking at the data table..."; DATA) shown in Table 2. And he also states his
preference: "I would choose the optic binary sensor" (TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS). However, unlike Joe, Mike
does not provide a clear justification for choosing the optic binary sensor. Instead, he provides an explanation of
how the optic binary sensor functions in contrast to the piezoelectric: "This does not take into account the need
for reflection in order for it to work" (DESIGN REASONING). If we refer back to Table 2 from the Control Sensor
Overview, we might infer that he was thinking about the cost efficiency: the optic binary sensor has the lowest
cost. But he does not actually talk explicitly about any of the performance attributes--which were the basis of
Sam's   original  question. Instead, he refers to  an explanation   of how optic  binary sensors  function  that also
comes from the Control Sensor Overview. Based on this limitation, Mike accepts Joe's proposal.
         Thus,   Mike   is clearly engaged with   the Control  Sensor  Overview   document:  he  references  the data
table and knows how the optic binary sensor works. However, all of this information comes from the same

document. He is not integrating information across multiple readings, and he is not reading deeply enough to
recognize that in this situation, his explanation of the mechanisms by which the binary optical sensor functions
is less relevant than its impact on the PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS of the device.
          Line 4: Joe's response: In line 4, Joe disagrees with Mike: "I don't think we should use the optic
binary sensor" (TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS), and he explicitly refers to four PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS, where
Mike did not refer to any. He recognizes the optic binary sensor has benefits on cost ("the cost is pretty cheap")
and recharge interval ("it has the best recharge interval by about 40 minutes"; DATA). However, he emphasizes
that the optic binary "performs worst in agility and safety" (DESIGN REASONING).
          That is, Joe reuses the cost and safety information from the Control Sensor Overview shown in Table 2
and combines the information from the Control Sensor and Power Source Experimental Report on recharge
interval, payload, and agility, and the Safety Standard Handbook on safety information, to determine the impact
of optic binary sensors. Once again, he is looking across multiple documents and integrating information about
multiple performance attributes to support is argument against an alternative to his original proposal.

Comparing ENA models for Mike and Joe

Figure 3. Individual ENA networks showing the connections made by Joe, the long reader (right) and Mike, the
short reader (left). Joe connected DATA with TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS, DESIGN REASONING, and PERFORMANCE
     PARAMETERS; Mike (left) connected only TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS with DATA and DESIGN REASONING.

          Figure 3 above shows the individual networks of Mike and Joe from just this short excerpt. In line 2,
when  Joe  talks about  his preference, he  makes    a connection    between    TECHNICAL    CONSTRAINTS    and  DESIGN
REASONING when he justifies his choice. He also makes a connection between PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS and
DATA  by  explaining   his choice  in terms of  both   performance       parameters and cost   with  actual  value from
multiple  documents.   Similarly,  in line 4,  Joe makes     connections     among  TECHNICAL     CONSTRAINTS,    DATA,
PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS, and DESIGN REASONING. On the other hand, Mike makes a connection between
TECHNICAL   CONSTRAINTS     and  DESIGN   REASONING    (line 3),   and TECHNICAL    CONSTRAINTS     and  DATA   (line 3).
These  individual  networks  of  Mike  and  Joe  align with     the characteristics of long   and  short readers'  group
networks in the sense that they show Joe linking concepts more completely than Mike did, and specifically
making more robust connections to DATA.
          Combined with the qualitative analysis, which shows that linking of these concepts is a reflection of
deeper engagement    with   the readings,  and the quantitative     analysis above, which    shows  that longer  readers
consistently make more robust use of data during design discussions, suggests that longer reading is associated
with deeper reading.

Discussion
In this paper, we investigated whether long readers make different contributions to collaborative discussions
than short readers  in one  CSCL   context.   Our  results show     that short readers were   less likely to  be able to
articulate complex arguments with clear justifications, whereas long readers who engage more deeply with the
readings were better able to flexibly and dynamically integrate information from multiple sources and work it
into their arguments in collaborative discussions. Given these differences, our findings suggest that in this case,
relatively thin data about reading frequency and mean reading duration could be used to make inferences about
students' reading  behavior  in  a CSCL    context where     it is  impossible  to  directly observe students'   reading
behavior directly. It also shows the power of a multimodal approach to the data--and in particular, it shows that
in addition to using multimodal data to get a better understanding of the student learning, we can also use one
mode   of data (in this case,   discussion data)  to get   a better  understanding   of  another   mode   (in this case,
clickstream data).

          This study has several limitations. First, it does not show directly that reading frequency and duration
correspond with reading comprehension, only that they correspond with more or less sophisticated contributions
to collaborative discussions. In particular, it did not model the relationship between specific reading behaviors
and contributions to collaborative discussions in temporal context. Moreover, further research would be needed
to disambiguate the effects of reading frequency and duration from other variables, such as prior engineering
knowledge.    In future work,   we  plan  to build  on  this work   to address  these shortcomings    by  modeling   the
relationships  between  reading    behaviors  and  discussion   contributions  as they  occur in temporal   proximity.
Despite  these   limitations, this study  suggests    that  student reading   behaviors are  associated  with  complex
problem-solving behaviors: specifically, that long readers read more deeply, and are thus able to make more
sophisticated  contributions   to  collaborative   problem-solving     efforts than short    readers who   are reading
shallowly. Moreover,    it provides  evidence    that the   frequency  and duration of  reading, which    can be  easily
determined from the clickstream data recorded by most CSCL environments, can in some cases be used as a
proxy for reading engagement, which is difficult to observe directly in virtual settings.
