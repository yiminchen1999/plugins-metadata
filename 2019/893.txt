         Abstract:  Game-based     learning   environments  provide   students  with  the opportunity  to
         collaborate with peers and solve ill-defined problems that align to a problem-based learning
         (PBL) inquiry cycle. However, game-based assessments must not only be psychometrically
         valid, but  also   fun. Drawing   on  problem-based     learning  (Hmelo-Silver,    2004) and  a
         collaborative problem-solving    framework (Liu    et al, 2016),  we present a conceptual  piece
         detailing the design of collaborative work products and PBL assessments in the context of our
         game-based learning environment.

Problem-Based Learning (PBL) refers to an instructional method that presents an ill-defined problem that students
solve collaboratively with the aid of scaffolds (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). Although PBL has often been used in the
classrooms, game-based learning environments can provide a rich context to situate problems. Shifting to a game-
based learning environment means that generating a validated assessment can be challenging since it requires
accounting for assessment design, psychometrics and the element of fun. To address this challenge, we utilize Liu
et al.'s (2016) evidence-centered design (ECD) framework of collaborative problem solving (CPS). We aim to
explore the relationship between scaffolds and the impact it has on group collaboration and learning outcomes. In
this conceptual paper, we highlight how CPS framework aligns with steps in the PBL process and the design of
collaborative work products in the context of a game-based learning environment1. It is hoped that by making
these aspects visible in our work, we can facilitate discussions about how to design game-based PBL assessment
in collaborative settings.

Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) approach to game-based assessments
Evidence-centered   design  (ECD)   is an approach towards     designing  assessments by  attending to evidentiary
arguments, wherein claims about what students know can be reasoned from what they do (Mislevy et al., 2014).
There are multiple  layers  that need  to be  addressed in  the design  of assessments;  domain  analysis, domain
modeling, conceptual assessment framework (CAF), assessment implementation and delivery (Mislevy et al.,
2014). The ECD framework has been widely utilized in game-based assessments, allowing researchers to examine
constructs such as emotional engagement (Kim & Shute, 2015). Given the centrality of collaboration in PBL, we
utilize the collaborative problem solving (CPS) model designed by Liu et al. (2016) who outline four categories
of skills (table 1), that were crucial to successful collaborative problem solving. In their work, the authors found
that individuals who were able to share ideas with others performed significantly better at understanding seismic
events (i.e., their outcome of interest) than those working on their own. In table 1, we present an alignment
between CPS, the PBL cycle and activities in CRYSTAL ISLAND: ECOJOURNEYS. In ECOJOURNEYS, students
work  in groups  of four   and have to  solve an aquatic  problem.   As  students engage  in the game, they  use a
whiteboard tool, hypothesis board and chat to share their ideas and solve the problem.

In our work, the student model is an integration of the CPS model and the problem-solving processes in the PBL
cycle. Based on both the CPS and problem-solving processes in the PBL cycle, we identify two dimensions of
interest: collaboration skills as it relates to sharing and negotiating ideas and process management skills. Based
on this alignment, it is reasonable to assume that there is a strong relationship among process management skills,
problem-solving skills, and content learning. To unpack the relationship between the student model and the task
model (i.e., student activities), we provide an outline of work products (Mislevy et al., 2014) in the game that and
that would help elicit evidence of desired student competency (i.e., CPS skills).

These work products are associated with designed scaffolds in the game, such as the whiteboard, a hypothesis
board and prompts provided in the chat space to students. Based on when and how scaffolds were delivered to
students, we will leverage a time-series analysis (Sawyer, Rowe, Azevedo & Lester, 2018) to understand the
relationship between the scaffolds provided and collaborative problem skills at both individual and group level.
